A DOS'T O' BLUES

 BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY

  I' got no patience with blues at all! 

 And I ust to kindo talk 

 Aginst 'em, and claim, 'tel along last Fall, 

 They was none in the fambly stock; 

 But a nephew of mine, from Eelinoy, 

 That visited us last year, 

 He kindo convinct me differunt 

 While he was a-stayin' here. 



 Frum ever'-which way that blues is from, 

 They'd tackle him ever' ways; 

 They'd come to him in the night, and come 

 On Sundays, and rainy days; 

 They'd tackle him in corn-plantin' time, 

 And in harvest, and airly Fall, 

 But a dose't of blues in the wintertime, 

 He 'lowed, was the worst of all! 



 Said all diseases that ever he had— 

 The mumps, er the rheumatiz— 

 Er ever'-other-day-aigger's bad 

 Purt' nigh as anything is!— 

 Er a cyarbuncle, say, on the back of his neck, 

 Er a felon on his thumb,— 

 But you keep the blues away from him, 

 And all o' the rest could come! 



 And he'd moan, "They's nary a leaf below! 

 Ner a spear o' grass in sight! 

 And the whole wood-pile's clean under snow! 

 And the days is dark as night! 

 You can't go out—ner you can't stay in— 

 Lay down—stand up—ner set!" 

 And a tetch o' regular tyfoid-blues 

 Would double him jest clean shet! 



 I writ his parents a postal-kyard, 

 He could stay 'tel Spring-time come; 

 And Aprile first, as I rickollect, 

 Was the day we shipped him home! 

 Most o' his relatives, sence then, 

 Has either give up, er quit, 

 Er jest died off; but I understand 

 He's the same old color yit!
