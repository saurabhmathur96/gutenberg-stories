A CRY FROM THE CONSUMER

 BY WILBUR D. NESBIT

  Grasshoppers roam the Kansas fields and eat the tender grass— 

 A trivial affair, indeed, but what then comes to pass? 

 You go to buy a panama, or any other hat; 

 You learn the price has been advanced a lot because of that. 

 A glacier up in Canada has slipped a mile or two— 

 A little thing like this can boost the selling price of glue. 

 Occurrences so tragic always thrill me to the core; 

 I hope and pray that nothing ever happens any more. 



 Last week the peaceful Indians went a-searching after scalps, 

 And then there was an avalanche 'way over in the Alps; 

 These diametric happenings seem nothing much, but look— 

 We had to add a dollar to the wages of the cook. 

 The bean-crop down at Boston has grown measurably less, 

 And so the dealer charges more for goods to make a dress. 

 Each day there is some incident to make a man feel sore, 

 I'm on my knees to ask that nothing happens any more. 



 It didn't rain in Utah and it did in old Vermont— 

 Result: it costs you fifty more to take a summer's jaunt; 

 Upon the plains of Tibet some tornadoes took a roll— 

 Therefore the barons have to charge a higher price for coal.
