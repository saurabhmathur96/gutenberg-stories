ABANDONED By Guy De Maupassant
    

      “I really think you must be mad, my dear, to go for a country walk
      in such weather as this. You have had some very strange notions for the
      last two months. You drag me to the seaside in spite of myself, when you
      have never once had such a whim during all the forty-four years that we
      have been married. You chose FÃ©camp, which is a very dull town, without
      consulting me in the matter, and now you are seized with such a rage for
      walking, you who hardly ever stir out on foot, that you want to take a
      country walk on the hottest day of the year. Ask d’Apreval to go
      with you, as he is ready to gratify all your whims. As for me, I am going
      back to have a nap.”
    

      Madame de Cadour turned to her old friend and said:
    

      “Will you come with me, Monsieur d’Apreval?”
    

      He bowed with a smile, and with all the gallantry of former years:
    

      “I will go wherever you go,” he replied.
    

      “Very well, then, go and get a sunstroke,” Monsieur de Cadour
      said; and he went back to the HÃ´tel des Bains to lie down for an hour or
      two.
    

      As soon as they were alone, the old lady and her old companion set off,
      and she said to him in a low voice, squeezing his hand:
    

      “At last! at last!”
    

      “You are mad,” he said in a whisper. “I assure you that
      you are mad. Think of the risk you are running. If that man—”
    

      She started.
    

      “Oh! Henri, do not say that man, when you are speaking of him.”
    

      “Very well,” he said abruptly, “if our son guesses
      anything, if he has any suspicions, he will have you, he will have us both
      in his power. You have got on without seeing him for the last forty years.
      What is the matter with you to-day?”
    

      They had been going up the long street that leads from the sea to the
      town, and now they turned to the right, to go to Etretat. The white road
      stretched in front of them under a blaze of brilliant sunshine, so they
      went on slowly in the burning heat. She had taken her old friend’s
      arm, and was looking straight in front of her, with a fixed and haunted
      gaze, and at last she said:
    

      “And so you have not seen him again, either?”
    

      “No, never.”
    

      “Is it possible?”
    

      “My dear friend, do not let us begin that discussion again. I have a
      wife and children and you have a husband, so we both of us have much to
      fear from other people’s opinion.”
    

      She did not reply; she was thinking of her long past youth and of many sad
      things that had occurred. How well she recalled all the details of their
      early friendship, his smiles, the way he used to linger, in order to watch
      her until she was indoors. What happy days they were, the only really
      delicious days she had ever enjoyed, and how quickly they were over!
    

      And then—her discovery—of the penalty she paid! What anguish!
    

      Of that journey to the South, that long journey, her sufferings, her
      constant terror, that secluded life in the small, solitary house on the
      shores of the Mediterranean, at the bottom of a garden, which she did not
      venture to leave. How well she remembered those long days which she spent
      lying under an orange tree, looking up at the round, red fruit, amid the
      green leaves. How she used to long to go out, as far as the sea, whose
      fresh breezes came to her over the wall, and whose small waves she could
      hear lapping on the beach. She dreamed of its immense blue expanse
      sparkling under the sun, with the white sails of the small vessels, and a
      mountain on the horizon. But she did not dare to go outside the gate.
      Suppose anybody had recognized her!
    

      And those days of waiting, those last days of misery and expectation! The
      impending suffering, and then that terrible night! What misery she had
      endured, and what a night it was! How she had groaned and screamed! She
      could still see the pale face of her lover, who kissed her hand every
      moment, and the clean-shaven face of the doctor and the nurse’s
      white cap.
    

      And what she felt when she heard the child’s feeble cries, that
      wail, that first effort of a human’s voice!
    

      And the next day! the next day! the only day of her life on which she had
      seen and kissed her son; for, from that time, she had never even caught a
      glimpse of him.
    

      And what a long, void existence hers had been since then, with the thought
      of that child always, always floating before her. She had never seen her
      son, that little creature that had been part of herself, even once since
      then; they had taken him from her, carried him away, and had hidden him.
      All she knew was that he had been brought up by some peasants in Normandy,
      that he had become a peasant himself, had married well, and that his
      father, whose name he did not know, had settled a handsome sum of money on
      him.
    

      How often during the last forty years had she wished to go and see him and
      to embrace him! She could not imagine to herself that he had grown! She
      always thought of that small human atom which she had held in her arms and
      pressed to her bosom for a day.
    

      How often she had said to M. d’Apreval: “I cannot bear it any
      longer; I must go and see him.”
    

      But he had always stopped her and kept her from going. She would be unable
      to restrain and to master herself; their son would guess it and take
      advantage of her, blackmail her; she would be lost.
    

      “What is he like?” she said.
    

      “I do not know. I have not seen him again, either.”
    

      “Is it possible? To have a son and not to know him; to be afraid of
      him and to reject him as if he were a disgrace! It is horrible.”
    

      They went along the dusty road, overcome by the scorching sun, and
      continually ascending that interminable hill.
    

      “One might take it for a punishment,” she continued; “I
      have never had another child, and I could no longer resist the longing to
      see him, which has possessed me for forty years. You men cannot understand
      that. You must remember that I shall not live much longer, and suppose I
      should never see him, never have seen him! ... Is it possible? How could I
      wait so long? I have thought about him every day since, and what a
      terrible existence mine has been! I have never awakened, never, do you
      understand, without my first thoughts being of him, of my child. How is
      he? Oh, how guilty I feel toward him! Ought one to fear what the world may
      say in a case like this? I ought to have left everything to go after him,
      to bring him up and to show my love for him. I should certainly have been
      much happier, but I did not dare, I was a coward. How I have suffered! Oh,
      how those poor, abandoned children must hate their mothers!”
    

      She stopped suddenly, for she was choked by her sobs. The whole valley was
      deserted and silent in the dazzling light and the overwhelming heat, and
      only the grasshoppers uttered their shrill, continuous chirp among the
      sparse yellow grass on both sides of the road.
    

      “Sit down a little,” he said.
    

      She allowed herself to be led to the side of the ditch and sank down with
      her face in her hands. Her white hair, which hung in curls on both sides
      of her face, had become tangled. She wept, overcome by profound grief,
      while he stood facing her, uneasy and not knowing what to say, and he
      merely murmured: “Come, take courage.”
    

      She got up.
    

      “I will,” she said, and wiping her eyes, she began to walk
      again with the uncertain step of an elderly woman.
    

      A little farther on the road passed beneath a clump of trees, which hid a
      few houses, and they could distinguish the vibrating and regular blows of
      a blacksmith’s hammer on the anvil; and presently they saw a wagon
      standing on the right side of the road in front of a low cottage, and two
      men shoeing a horse under a shed.
    

      Monsieur d’Apreval went up to them.
    

      “Where is Pierre Benedict’s farm?” he asked.
    

      “Take the road to the left, close to the inn, and then go straight
      on; it is the third house past Poret’s. There is a small spruce fir
      close to the gate; you cannot make a mistake.”
    

      They turned to the left. She was walking very slowly now, her legs
      threatened to give way, and her heart was beating so violently that she
      felt as if she should suffocate, while at every step she murmured, as if
      in prayer:
    

      “Oh! Heaven! Heaven!”
    

      Monsieur d’Apreval, who was also nervous and rather pale, said to
      her somewhat gruffly:
    

      “If you cannot manage to control your feelings, you will betray
      yourself at once. Do try and restrain yourself.”
    

      “How can I?” she replied. “My child! When I think that I
      am going to see my child.”
    

      They were going along one of those narrow country lanes between farmyards,
      that are concealed beneath a double row of beech trees at either side of
      the ditches, and suddenly they found themselves in front of a gate, beside
      which there was a young spruce fir.
    

      “This is it,” he said.
    

      She stopped suddenly and looked about her. The courtyard, which was
      planted with apple trees, was large and extended as far as the small
      thatched dwelling house. On the opposite side were the stable, the barn,
      the cow house and the poultry house, while the gig, the wagon and the
      manure cart were under a slated outhouse. Four calves were grazing under
      the shade of the trees and black hens were wandering all about the
      enclosure.
    

      All was perfectly still; the house door was open, but nobody was to be
      seen, and so they went in, when immediately a large black dog came out of
      a barrel that was standing under a pear tree, and began to bark furiously.
    

      There were four bee-hives on boards against the wall of the house.
    

      Monsieur d’Apreval stood outside and called out:
    

      “Is anybody at home?”
    

      Then a child appeared, a little girl of about ten, dressed in a chemise
      and a linen petticoat, with dirty, bare legs and a timid and cunning look.
      She remained standing in the doorway, as if to prevent any one going in.
    

      “What do you want?” she asked.
    

      “Is your father in?”
    

      “No.”
    

      “Where is he?”
    

      “I don’t know.”
    

      “And your mother?”
    

      “Gone after the cows.”
    

      “Will she be back soon?”
    

      “I don’t know.”
    

      Then suddenly the lady, as if she feared that her companion might force
      her to return, said quickly:
    

      “I shall not go without having seen him.”
    

      “We will wait for him, my dear friend.”
    

      As they turned away, they saw a peasant woman coming toward the house,
      carrying two tin pails, which appeared to be heavy and which glistened
      brightly in the sunlight.
    

      She limped with her right leg, and in her brown knitted jacket, that was
      faded by the sun and washed out by the rain, she looked like a poor,
      wretched, dirty servant.
    

      “Here is mamma.” the child said.
    

      When she got close to the house, she looked at the strangers angrily and
      suspiciously, and then she went in, as if she had not seen them. She
      looked old and had a hard, yellow, wrinkled face, one of those wooden
      faces that country people so often have.
    

      Monsieur d’Apreval called her back.
    

      “I beg your pardon, madame, but we came in to know whether you could
      sell us two glasses of milk.”
    

      She was grumbling when she reappeared in the door, after putting down her
      pails.
    

      “I don’t sell milk,” she replied.
    

      “We are very thirsty,” he said, “and madame is very
      tired. Can we not get something to drink?”
    

      The peasant woman gave them an uneasy and cunning glance and then she made
      up her mind.
    

      “As you are here, I will give you some,” she said, going into
      the house, and almost immediately the child came out and brought two
      chairs, which she placed under an apple tree, and then the mother, in turn
      brought out two bowls of foaming milk, which she gave to the visitors. She
      did not return to the house, however, but remained standing near them, as
      if to watch them and to find out for what purpose they had come there.
    

      “You have come from FÃ©camp?” she said.
    

      “Yes,” Monsieur d’Apreval replied, “we are staying
      at FÃ©camp for the summer.”
    

      And then, after a short silence he continued:
    

      “Have you any fowls you could sell us every week?”
    

      The woman hesitated for a moment and then replied:
    

      “Yes, I think I have. I suppose you want young ones?”
    

      “Yes, of course.”
    

      “What do you pay for them in the market?”
    

      D’Apreval, who had not the least idea, turned to his companion:
    

      “What are you paying for poultry in FÃ©camp, my dear lady?”
    

      “Four francs and four francs fifty centimes,” she said, her
      eyes full of tears, while the farmer’s wife, who was looking at her
      askance, asked in much surprise:
    

      “Is the lady ill, as she is crying?”
    

      He did not know what to say, and replied with some hesitation:
    

      “No—no—but she lost her watch as we came along, a very
      handsome watch, and that troubles her. If anybody should find it, please
      let us know.”
    

      Mother Benedict did not reply, as she thought it a very equivocal sort of
      answer, but suddenly she exclaimed:
    

      “Oh, here is my husband!”
    

      She was the only one who had seen him, as she was facing the gate. D’Apreval
      started and Madame de Cadour nearly fell as she turned round suddenly on
      her chair.
    

      A man bent nearly double, and out of breath, stood there, ten yards from
      them, dragging a cow at the end of a rope. Without taking any notice of
      the visitors, he said:
    

      “Confound it! What a brute!”
    

      And he went past them and disappeared in the cow house.
    

      Her tears had dried quickly as she sat there startled, without a word and
      with the one thought in her mind, that this was her son, and D’Apreval,
      whom the same thought had struck very unpleasantly, said in an agitated
      voice:
    

      “Is this Monsieur Benedict?”
    

      “Who told you his name?” the wife asked, still rather
      suspiciously.
    

      “The blacksmith at the corner of the highroad,” he replied,
      and then they were all silent, with their eyes fixed on the door of the
      cow house, which formed a sort of black hole in the wall of the building.
      Nothing could be seen inside, but they heard a vague noise, movements and
      footsteps and the sound of hoofs, which were deadened by the straw on the
      floor, and soon the man reappeared in the door, wiping his forehead, and
      came toward the house with long, slow strides. He passed the strangers
      without seeming to notice them and said to his wife:
    

      “Go and draw me a jug of cider; I am very thirsty.”
    

      Then he went back into the house, while his wife went into the cellar and
      left the two Parisians alone.
    

      “Let us go, let us go, Henri,” Madame de Cadour said, nearly
      distracted with grief, and so d’Apreval took her by the arm, helped
      her to rise, and sustaining her with all his strength, for he felt that
      she was nearly fainting, he led her out, after throwing five francs on one
      of the chairs.
    

      As soon as they were outside the gate, she began to sob and said, shaking
      with grief:
    

      “Oh! oh! is that what you have made of him?”
    

      He was very pale and replied coldly:
    

      “I did what I could. His farm is worth eighty thousand francs, and
      that is more than most of the sons of the middle classes have.”
    

      They returned slowly, without speaking a word. She was still crying; the
      tears ran down her cheeks continually for a time, but by degrees they
      stopped, and they went back to FÃ©camp, where they found Monsieur de Cadour
      waiting dinner for them. As soon as he saw them, he began to laugh and
      exclaimed:
    

      “So my wife has had a sunstroke, and I am very glad of it. I really
      think she has lost her head for some time past!”
    

      Neither of them replied, and when the husband asked them, rubbing his
      hands:
    

      “Well, I hope that, at least, you have had a pleasant walk?”
    

      Monsieur d’Apreval replied:
    

      “A delightful walk, I assure you; perfectly delightful.”
    

      THE GUILTY SECRET BY PAUL DE KOCK
    

      Nathalie De Hauteville was twenty-two years old, and had been a widow for
      three years. She was one of the prettiest women in Paris; her large dark
      eyes shone with remarkable brilliancy, and she united the sparkling
      vivacity of an Italian and the depth of feeling of a Spaniard to the grace
      which always distinguishes a Parisian born and bred. Considering herself
      too young to be entirely alone, she had long ago invited M. d’Ablaincourt,
      an old uncle of hers, to come and live with her.
    

      M. d’Ablaincourt was an old bachelor; he had never loved anything in
      this world but himself. He was an egotist, too lazy to do any one an ill
      turn, but at the same time too selfish to do any one a kindness, unless it
      would tend directly to his own advantage. And yet, with an air of
      complaisance, as if he desired nothing so much as the comfort of those
      around him, he consented to his niece’s proposal, in the hope that
      she would do many little kind offices for him, which would add materially
      to his comfort.
    

      M. d’Ablaincourt accompanied his niece when she resumed her place in
      society; but sometimes, when he felt inclined to stay at home, he would
      say to her: “My dear Nathalie, I am afraid you will not be much
      amused this evening. They will only play cards; besides, I don’t
      think any of your friends will be there. Of course, I am ready to take
      you, if you wish to go.”
    

      And Nathalie, who had great confidence in all her uncle said, would stay
      at home.
    

      In the same manner, M. d’Ablaincourt, who was a great gourmand, said
      to his niece: “My dear, you know that I am not at all fond of
      eating, and am satisfied with the simplest fare; but I must tell you that
      your cook puts too much salt in everything! It is very unwholesome.”
    

      So they changed the cook.
    

      Again, the garden was out of order; the trees before the old gentleman’s
      window must be cut down, because their shade would doubtless cause a
      dampness in the house prejudicial to Nathalie’s health; or the
      surrey was to be changed for a landau.
    

      Nathalie was a coquette. Accustomed to charm, she listened with smiles to
      the numerous protestations of admiration which she received. She sent all
      who aspired to her hand to her uncle, saying: “Before I give you any
      hope, I must know my uncle’s opinion.”
    

      It is likely that Nathalie would have answered differently if she had ever
      felt a real preference for any one; but heretofore she seemed to have
      preferred her liberty.
    

      The old uncle, for his part, being now master in his niece’s house,
      was very anxious for her to remain as she was. A nephew might be somewhat
      less submissive than Nathalie. Therefore, he never failed to discover some
      great fault in each of those who sought an alliance with the pretty widow.
    

      Besides his egotism and his epicureanism, the dear uncle had another
      passion—to play backgammon. The game amused him very much; but the
      difficulty was to find any one to play with. If, by accident, any of
      Nathalie’s visitors understood it, there was no escape from a long
      siege with the old gentleman; but most people preferred cards.
    

      In order to please her uncle, Nathalie tried to learn this game; but it
      was almost impossible. She could not give her attention to one thing for
      so long a time. Her uncle scolded. Nathalie gave up in despair.
    

      “It was only for your own amusement that I wished to teach it to
      you,” said the good M. d’Ablaincourt.
    

      Things were at this crisis when, at a ball one evening, Nathalie was
      introduced to a M. d’Apremont, a captain in the navy.
    

      Nathalie raised her eyes, expecting to see a great sailor, with a wooden
      leg and a bandage over one eye; when to her great surprise, she beheld a
      man of about thirty, tall and finely formed, with two sound legs and two
      good eyes.
    

      Armand d’Apremont had entered the navy at a very early age, and had
      arrived, although very young, to the dignity of a captain. He had amassed
      a large fortune, in addition to his patrimonial estates, and he had now
      come home to rest after his labors. As yet, however, he was a single man,
      and, moreover, had always laughed at love.
    

      But when he saw Nathalie, his opinions underwent a change. For the first
      time in his life he regretted that he had never learned to dance, and he
      kept his eyes fixed on her constantly.
    

      His attentions to the young widow soon became a subject of general
      conversation, and, at last, the report reached the ears of M. d’Ablaincourt.
      When Nathalie mentioned, one evening, that she expected the captain to
      spend the evening with her, the old man grew almost angry.
    

      “Nathalie,” said he, “you act entirely without
      consulting me. I have heard that the captain is very rude and unpolished
      in his manners. To be sure, I have only seen him standing behind your
      chair; but he has never even asked after my health. I only speak for your
      interest, as you are so giddy.”
    

      Nathalie begged her uncle’s pardon, and even offered not to receive
      the captain’s visit; but this he forbore to require—secretly
      resolving not to allow these visits to become too frequent.
    

      But how frail are all human resolutions—overturned by the merest
      trifle! In this case, the game of backgammon was the unconscious cause of
      Nathalie’s becoming Mme. d’Apremont. The captain was an
      excellent hand at backgammon. When the uncle heard this, he proposed a
      game; and the captain, who understood that it was important to gain the
      uncle’s favor, readily acceded.
    

      This did not please Nathalie. She preferred that he should be occupied
      with herself. When all the company were gone, she turned to her uncle,
      saying: “You were right, uncle, after all. I do not admire the
      captain’s manners; I see now that I should not have invited him.”
    

      “On the contrary, niece, he is a very well-behaved man. I have
      invited him to come here very often, and play backgammon with me—that
      is, to pay his addresses to you.”
    

      Nathalie saw that the captain had gained her uncle’s heart, and she
      forgave him for having been less attentive to her. He soon came again,
      and, thanks to the backgammon, increased in favor with the uncle.
    

      He soon captivated the heart of the pretty widow, also. One morning,
      Nathalie came blushing to her uncle.
    

      “The captain has asked me to marry him. What do you advise me to do?”
    

      He reflected for a few moments. “If she refuses him, D’Apremont
      will come here no longer, and then no more backgammon. But if she marries
      him, he will be here always, and I shall have my games.” And the
      answer was: “You had better marry him.”
    

      Nathalie loved Armand; but she would not yield too easily. She sent for
      the captain.
    

      “If you really love me—”
    

      “Ah, can you doubt it?”
    

      “Hush! do not interrupt me. If you really love me, you will give me
      one proof of it.”
    

      “Anything you ask. I swear—”
    

      “No, you must never swear any more; and, one thing more, you must
      never smoke. I detest the smell of tobacco, and I will not have a husband
      who smokes.”
    

      Armand sighed, and promised.
    

      The first months of their marriage passed smoothly, but sometimes Armand
      became thoughtful, restless, and grave. After some time, these fits of
      sadness became more frequent.
    

      “What is the matter?” asked Nathalie one day, on seeing him
      stamp with impatience. “Why are you so irritable?”
    

      “Nothing—nothing at all!” replied the captain, as if
      ashamed of his ill humor.
    

      “Tell me,” Nathalie insisted, “have I displeased you in
      anything?”
    

      The captain assured her that he had no reason to be anything but delighted
      with her conduct on all occasions, and for a time he was all right. Then
      soon he was worse than before.
    

      Nathalie was distressed beyond measure. She imparted her anxiety to her
      uncle, who replied: “Yes, my dear, I know what you mean; I have
      often remarked it myself, at backgammon. He is very inattentive, and often
      passes his hand over his forehead, and starts up as if something agitated
      him.”
    

      And one day, when his old habits of impatience and irritability
      reappeared, more marked than ever, the captain said to his wife: “My
      dear, an evening walk will do me a world of good; an old sailor like
      myself cannot bear to sit around the house after dinner. Nevertheless, if
      you have any objection—”
    

      “Oh, no! What objection can I have?”
    

      He went out, and continued to do so, day after day, at the same hour.
      Invariably he returned in the best of good humor.
    

      Nathalie was now unhappy indeed. “He loves some other woman,
      perhaps,” she thought, “and he must see her every day. Oh, how
      wretched I am! But I must let him know that his perfidy is discovered. No,
      I will wait until I shall have some certain proof wherewith to confront
      him.”
    

      And she went to seek her uncle. “Ah, I am the most unhappy creature
      in the world!” she sobbed.
    

      “What is the matter?” cried the old man, leaning back in his
      armchair.
    

      “Armand leaves the house for two hours every evening, after dinner,
      and comes back in high spirits and as anxious to please me as on the day
      of our marriage. Oh, uncle, I cannot bear it any longer! If you do not
      assist me to discover where he goes, I will seek a separation.”
    

      “But, my dear niece—”
    

      “My dear uncle, you who are so good and obliging, grant me this one
      favor. I am sure there is some woman in the secret.”
    

      M. d’Ablaincourt wished to prevent a rupture between his niece and
      nephew, which would interfere very much with the quiet, peaceable life
      which he led at their house. He pretended to follow Armand; but came back
      very soon, saying he had lost sight of him.
    

      “But in what direction does he go?”
    

      “Sometimes one way, and sometimes another, but always alone; so your
      suspicions are unfounded. Be assured, he only walks for exercise.”
    

      But Nathalie was not to be duped in this way. She sent for a little errand
      boy, of whose intelligence she had heard a great deal.
    

      “M. d’Apremont goes out every evening.”
    

      “Yes, madame.”
    

      “To-morrow, you will follow him; observe where he goes, and come and
      tell me privately. Do you understand?”
    

      “Yes, madame.”
    

      Nathalie waited impatiently for the next day, and for the hour of her
      husband’s departure. At last, the time came—the pursuit is
      going on—Nathalie counted the moments. After three-quarters of an
      hour, the messenger arrived, covered with dust.
    

      “Well,” exclaimed Nathalie, “speak! Tell me everything
      that you have seen!”
    

      “Madame, I followed M. d’Apremont, at a distance, as far as
      the Rue Vieille du Temple, where he entered a small house, in an alley.
      There was no servant to let him in.”
    

      “An alley! No servant! Dreadful!”
    

      “I went in directly after him, and heard him go up-stairs and unlock
      a door.”
    

      “Open the door himself, without knocking! Are you sure of that?”
    

      “Yes, madame.”
    

      “The wretch! So he has a key! But, go on.”
    

      “When the door shut after him, I stole softly up-stairs, and peeped
      through the keyhole.”
    

      “You shall have twenty francs more.”
    

      “I peeped through the keyhole, and saw him drag a trunk along the
      floor.”
    

      “A trunk?”
    

      “Then he undressed himself, and—”
    

      “Undressed himself!”
    

      “Then, for a few seconds, I could not see him, and directly he
      appeared again, in a sort of gray blouse, and a cap on his Lead.”
    

      “A blouse! What in the world does he want with a blouse? What next?”
    

      “I came away, then, madame, and made haste to tell you; but he is
      there still.”
    

      “Well, now run to the corner and get me a cab, and direct the
      coachman to the house where you have been.”
    

      While the messenger went for the cab, Nathalie hurried on her hat and
      cloak, and ran into her uncle’s room.
    

      “I have found him out—he loves another. He’s at her
      house now, in a gray blouse. But I will go and confront him, and then you
      will see me no more.”
    

      The old man had no time to reply. She was gone, with her messenger, in the
      cab. They stopped at last.
    

      “Here is the house.”
    

      Nathalie got out, pale and trembling.
    

      “Shall I go up-stairs with you, madame?” asked the boy.
    

      “No, I will go alone. The third story, isn’t it?”
    

      “Yes, madame; the left-hand door, at the head of the stairs.”
    

      It seemed that now, indeed, the end of all things was at hand.
    

      Nathalie mounted the dark, narrow stairs, and arrived at the door, and,
      almost fainting, she cried: “Open the door, or I shall die!”
    

      The door was opened, and Nathalie fell into her husband’s arms. He
      was alone in the room, clad in a gray blouse, and—smoking a Turkish
      pipe.
    

      “My wife!” exclaimed Armand, in surprise.
    

      “Your wife—who, suspecting your perfidy, has followed you, to
      discover the cause of your mysterious conduct!”
    

      “How, Nathalie, my mysterious conduct? Look, here it is!”
      (Showing his pipe.) “Before our marriage, you forbade me to smoke,
      and I promised to obey you. For some months I kept my promise; but you
      know what it cost me; you remember how irritable and sad I became. It was
      my pipe, my beloved pipe, that I regretted. One day, in the country, I
      discovered a little cottage, where a peasant was smoking. I asked him if
      he could lend me a blouse and cap; for I should like to smoke with him,
      but it was necessary to conceal it from you, as the smell of smoke,
      remaining in my clothes, would have betrayed me. It was soon settled
      between us. I returned thither every afternoon, to indulge in my favorite
      occupation; and, with the precaution of a cap to keep the smoke from
      remaining in my hair, I contrived to deceive you. This is all the mystery.
      Forgive me.”
    

      Nathalie kissed him, crying: “I might have known it could not be! I
      am happy now, and you shall smoke as much as you please, at home.”
    

      And Nathalie returned to her uncle, saying: “Uncle, he loves me! He
      was only smoking, but hereafter he is to smoke at home.”
    

      “I can arrange it all,” said D’Ablaincourt; “he
      shall smoke while he plays backgammon.”
    

      “In that way,” thought the old man, “I shall be sure of
      my game.”
