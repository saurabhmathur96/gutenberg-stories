I
After leaving Vienna, and long before you come to
    Buda-Pesth, the Danube enters a region of singular loneliness
    and desolation, where its waters spread away on all sides
    regardless of a main channel, and the country becomes a swamp
    for miles upon miles, covered by a vast sea of low
    willow-bushes. On the big maps this deserted area is painted in
    a fluffy blue, growing fainter in color as it leaves the banks,
    and across it may be seen in large straggling letters the word
    Sümpfe, meaning marshes.
In high flood this great acreage of sand, shingle-beds, and
    willow-grown islands is almost topped by the water, but in
    normal seasons the bushes bend and rustle in the free winds,
    showing their silver leaves to the sunshine in an ever-moving
    plain of bewildering beauty. These willows never attain to the
    dignity of trees; they have no rigid trunks; they remain humble
    bushes, with rounded tops and soft outline, swaying on slender
    stems that answer to the least pressure of the wind; supple as
    grasses, and so continually shifting that they somehow give the
    impression that the entire plain is moving and alive.
    For the wind sends waves rising and falling over the whole
    surface, waves of leaves instead of waves of water, green
    swells like the sea, too, until the branches turn and lift, and
    then silvery white as their under-side turns to the sun.
Happy to slip beyond the control of stern banks, the Danube
    here wanders about at will among the intricate network of
    channels intersecting the islands everywhere with broad avenues
    down which the waters pour with a shouting sound; making
    whirlpools, eddies, and foaming rapids; tearing at the sandy
    banks; carrying away masses of shore and willow-clumps; and
    forming new islands innumerable which shift daily in size and
    shape and possess at best an impermanent life, since the
    flood-time obliterates their very existence.
Properly speaking, this fascinating part of the river's life
    begins soon after leaving Pressburg, and we, in our Canadian
    canoe, with gipsy tent and frying-pan on board, reached it on
    the crest of a rising flood about mid-July. That very same
    morning, when the sky was reddening before sunrise, we had
    slipped swiftly through still-sleeping Vienna, leaving it a
    couple of hours later a mere patch of smoke against the blue
    hills of the Wienerwald on the horizon; we had breakfasted
    below Fischeramend under a grove of birch trees roaring in the
    wind; and had then swept on the tearing current past Orth,
    Hainburg, Petronell (the old Roman Carnuntum of Marcus
    Aurelius), and so under the frowning heights of Theben on a
    spur of the Carpathians, where the March steals in quietly from
    the left and the frontier is crossed between Austria and
    Hungary.
Racing along at twelve kilometers an hour soon took us well
    into Hungary, and the muddy waters—sure sign of
    flood—sent us aground on many a shingle-bed, and twisted
    us like a cork in many a sudden belching whirlpool before the
    towers of Pressburg (Hungarian, Poszóny) showed against
    the sky; and then the canoe, leaping like a spirited horse,
    flew at top speed under the gray walls, negotiated safely the
    sunken chain of the Fliegende Brücke ferry, turned the
    corner sharply to the left, and plunged on yellow foam into the
    wilderness of islands, sand-banks, and swamp-land
    beyond—the land of the willows.
The change came suddenly, as when a series of bioscope
    pictures snaps down on the streets of a town and shifts without
    warning into the scenery of lake and forest. We entered the
    land of desolation on wings, and in less than half an hour
    there was neither boat nor fishing-hut nor red roof, nor any
    single sign of human habitation and civilization within sight.
    The sense of remoteness from the world of human kind, the utter
    isolation, the fascination of this singular world of willows,
    winds, and waters, instantly laid its spell upon us both, so
    that we allowed laughingly to one another that we ought by
    rights to have held some special kind of passport to admit us,
    and that we had, somewhat audaciously, come without asking
    leave into a separate little kingdom of wonder and
    magic—a kingdom that was reserved for the use of others
    who had a right to it, with everywhere unwritten warnings to
    trespassers for those who had the imagination to discover
    them.
Though still early in the afternoon, the ceaseless
    buffetings of a most tempestuous wind made us feel weary, and
    we at once began casting about for a suitable camping-ground
    for the night. But the bewildering character of the islands
    made landing difficult; the swirling flood carried us in-shore
    and then swept us out again; the willow branches tore our hands
    as we seized them to stop the canoe, and we pulled many a yard
    of sandy bank into the water before at length we shot with a
    great sideways blow from the wind into a backwater and managed
    to beach the bows in a cloud of spray. Then we lay panting and
    laughing after our exertions on hot yellow sand, sheltered from
    the wind, and in the full blaze of a scorching sun, a cloudless
    blue sky above, and an immense army of dancing, shouting willow
    bushes, closing in from all sides, shining with spray and
    clapping their thousand little hands as though to applaud the
    success of our efforts.
"What a river!" I said to my companion, thinking of all the
    way we had traveled from the source in the Black Forest, and
    how we had often been obliged to wade and push in the upper
    shallows at the beginning of June.
"Won't stand much nonsense now, will it?" he said, pulling
    the canoe a little farther into safety up the sand, and then
    composing himself for a nap.
I lay by his side, happy and peaceful in the bath of the
    elements—water, wind, sand, and the great fire of the
    sun—thinking of the long journey that lay behind us, and
    of the great stretch before us to the Black Sea, and how lucky
    I was to have such a delightful and charming traveling
    companion as my friend, the Swede.
We had made many similar journeys together, but the Danube,
    more than any other river I knew, impressed us from the very
    beginning with its aliveness. From its tiny bubbling
    entry into the world among the pinewood gardens of
    Donaueschingen, until this moment when it began to play the
    great river-game of losing itself among the deserted swamps,
    unobserved, unrestrained, it had seemed to us like following
    the growth of some living creature. Sleepy at first, but later
    developing violent desires as it became conscious of its deep
    soul, it rolled, like some huge fluid being, through all the
    countries we had passed, holding our little craft on its mighty
    shoulders, playing roughly with us sometimes, yet always
    friendly and well-meaning, till at length we had come
    inevitably to regard it as a Great Personage.
How, indeed, could it be otherwise, since it told us so much
    of its secret life? At night we heard it singing to the moon as
    we lay in our tent, uttering that odd sibilant note peculiar to
    itself and said to be caused by the rapid tearing of the
    pebbles along its bed, so great is its hurrying speed. We knew,
    too, the voice of its gurgling whirlpools, suddenly bubbling up
    on a surface previously quite calm; the roar of its shallows
    and swift rapids; its constant steady thundering below all mere
    surface sounds; and that ceaseless tearing of its icy waters at
    the banks. How it stood up and shouted when the rains fell flat
    upon its face! And how its laughter roared out when the wind
    blew upstream and tried to stop its growing speed! We knew all
    its sounds and voices, its tumblings and foamings, its
    unnecessary splashing against the bridges; that self-conscious
    chatter when there were hills to look on; the affected dignity
    of its speech when it passed through the little towns, far too
    important to laugh; and all these faint, sweet whisperings when
    the sun caught it fairly in some slow curve and poured down
    upon it till the steam rose.
It was full of tricks, too, in its early life before the
    great world knew it. There were places in the upper reaches
    among the Swabian forests, when yet the first whispers of its
    destiny had not reached it, where it elected to disappear
    through holes in the ground, to appear again on the other side
    of the porous limestone hills and start a new river with
    another name; leaving, too, so little water in its own bed that
    we had to climb out and wade and push the canoe through miles
    of shallows!
And a chief pleasure, in those early days of its
    irresponsible youth, was to lie low, like Brer Fox, just before
    the little turbulent tributaries came to join it from the Alps,
    and to refuse to acknowledge them when in, but to run for miles
    side by side, the dividing line well marked, the very levels
    different, the Danube utterly declining to recognize the
    new-comer. Below Passau, however, it gave up this particular
    trick, for there the Inn comes in with a thundering power
    impossible to ignore, and so pushes and incommodes the parent
    river that there is hardly room for them in the long twisting
    gorge that follows, and the Danube is shoved this way and that
    against the cliffs, and forced to hurry itself with great waves
    and much dashing to and fro in order to get through in time.
    And during the fight our canoe slipped down from its shoulder
    to its breast, and had the time of its life among the
    struggling waves. But the Inn taught the old river a lesson,
    and after Passau it no longer pretended to ignore new
    arrivals.
This was many days back, of course, and since then we had
    come to know other aspects of the great creature, and across
    the Bavarian wheat plain of Straubing she wandered so slowly
    under the blazing June sun that we could well imagine only the
    surface inches were water, while below there moved, concealed
    as by a silken mantle, a whole army of Undines, passing
    silently and unseen down to the sea, and very leisurely too,
    lest they be discovered.
Much, too, we forgave her because of her friendliness to the
    birds and animals that haunted the shores. Cormorants lined the
    banks in lonely places in rows like short black palings; gray
    crows crowded the shingle-beds; storks stood fishing in the
    vistas of shallower water that opened up between the islands,
    and hawks, swans, and marsh birds of all sorts filled the air
    with glinting wings and singing, petulant cries. It was
    impossible to feel annoyed with the river's vagaries after
    seeing a deer leap with a splash into the water at sunrise and
    swim past the bows of the canoe; and often we saw fawns peering
    at us from the underbrush, or looked straight into the brown
    eyes of a stag as we charged full tilt round a corner and
    entered another reach of the river. Foxes, too, everywhere
    haunted the banks, tripping daintily among the driftwood and
    disappearing so suddenly that it was impossible to see how they
    managed it.
But now, after leaving Pressburg, everything changed a
    little, and the Danube became more serious. It ceased trifling.
    It was halfway to the Black Sea, within scenting distance
    almost of other, stranger countries where no tricks would be
    permitted or understood. It became suddenly grown-up, and
    claimed our respect and even our awe. It broke out into three
    arms, for one thing, that only met again a hundred kilometers
    farther down, and for a canoe there were no indications which
    one was intended to be followed.
"If you take a side channel," said the Hungarian officer we
    met in the Pressburg shop while buying provisions, "you may
    find yourselves, when the flood subsides, forty miles from
    anywhere, high and dry, and you may easily starve. There are no
    people, no farms, no fishermen. I warn you not to continue. The
    river, too, is still rising, and this wind will increase."
The rising river did not alarm us in the least, but the
    matter of being left high and dry by a sudden subsidence of the
    waters might be serious, and we had consequently laid in an
    extra stock of provisions. For the rest, the officer's prophecy
    held true, and the wind, blowing down a perfectly clear sky,
    increased steadily till it reached the dignity of a westerly
    gale.
It was earlier than usual when we camped, for the sun was a
    good hour or two from the horizon, and leaving my friend still
    asleep on the hot sand, I wandered about in desultory
    examination of our hotel. The island, I found, was less than an
    acre in extent, a mere sandy bank standing some two or three
    feet above the level of the river. The far end, pointing into
    the sunset, was covered with flying spray which the tremendous
    wind drove off the crests of the broken waves. It was
    triangular in shape, with the apex upstream.
I stood there for several minutes, watching the impetuous
    crimson flood bearing down with a shouting roar, dashing in
    waves against the bank as though to sweep it bodily away, and
    then swirling by in two foaming streams on either side. The
    ground seemed to shake with the shock and rush while the
    furious movement of the willow bushes as the wind poured over
    them increased the curious illusion that the island itself
    actually moved. Above, for a mile or two, I could see the great
    river descending upon me: it was like looking up the slope of a
    sliding hill, white with foam, and leaping up everywhere to
    show itself to the sun.
The rest of the island was too thickly grown with willows to
    make walking pleasant, but I made the tour, nevertheless. From
    the lower end the light, of course, changed, and the river
    looked dark and angry. Only the backs of the flying waves were
    visible, streaked with foam, and pushed forcibly by the great
    puffs of wind that fell upon them from behind. For a short mile
    it was visible, pouring in and out among the islands, and then
    disappearing with a huge sweep into the willows, which closed
    about it like a herd of monstrous antediluvian creatures
    crowding down to drink. They made me think of gigantic
    sponge-like growths that sucked the river up into themselves.
    They caused it to vanish from sight. They herded there together
    in such overpowering numbers.
Altogether it was an impressive scene, with its utter
    loneliness, its bizarre suggestion; and as I gazed, long and
    curiously, a singular emotion began stir somewhere in the
    depths of me. Midway in my delight of the wild beauty, there
    crept unbidden and unexplained, a curious feeling of
    disquietude, almost of alarm.
A rising river, perhaps, always suggests something of the
    ominous: many of the little islands I saw before me would
    probably have been swept away by the morning; this resistless,
    thundering flood of water touched the sense of awe. Yet I was
    aware that my uneasiness lay deeper far than the emotions of
    awe and wonder. It was not that I felt. Nor had it directly to
    do with the power of the driving wind—this shouting
    hurricane that might almost carry up a few acres of willows
    into the air and scatter them like so much chaff over the
    landscape. The wind was simply enjoying itself, for nothing
    rose out of the flat landscape to stop it, and I was conscious
    of sharing its great game with a kind of pleasurable
    excitement. Yet this novel emotion had nothing to do with the
    wind. Indeed, so vague was the sense of distress I experienced,
    that it was impossible to trace it to its source and deal with
    it accordingly, though I was aware somehow that it had to do
    with my realization of our utter insignificance before this
    unrestrained power of the elements about me. The huge-grown
    river had something to do with it too—a vague, unpleasant
    idea that we had somehow trifled with these great elemental
    forces in whose power we lay helpless every hour of the day and
    night. For here, indeed, they were gigantically at play
    together, and the sight appealed to the imagination.
But my emotion, so far as I could understand it, seemed to
    attach itself more particularly to the willow bushes, to these
    acres and acres of willows, crowding, so thickly growing there,
    swarming everywhere the eye could reach, pressing upon the
    river as though to suffocate it, standing in dense array mile
    after mile beneath the sky, watching, waiting, listening. And,
    apart quite from the elements, the willows connected themselves
    subtly with my malaise, attacking the mind insidiously somehow
    by reason of their vast numbers, and contriving in some way or
    other to represent to the imagination a new and mighty power, a
    power, moreover, not altogether friendly to us.
Great revelations of nature, of course, never fail to
    impress in one way or another, and I was no stranger to moods
    of the kind. Mountains overawe and oceans terrify, while the
    mystery of great forests exercises a spell peculiarly its own.
    But all these, at one point or another, somewhere link on
    intimately with human life and human experience. They stir
    comprehensible, even if alarming, emotions. They tend on the
    whole to exalt.
With this multitude of willows, however, it was something
    far different, I felt. Some essence emanated from them that
    besieged the heart. A sense of awe awakened, true, but of awe
    touched somewhere by a vague terror. Their serried ranks
    growing everywhere darker about me as the shadows deepened,
    moving furiously yet softly in the wind, woke in me the curious
    and unwelcome suggestion that we had trespassed here upon the
    borders of an alien world, a world where we were intruders, a
    world where we were not wanted or invited to remain—where
    we ran grave risks perhaps!
The feeling, however, though it refused to yield its meaning
    entirely to analysis, did not at the time trouble me by passing
    into menace. Yet it never left me quite, even during the very
    practical business of putting up the tent in a hurricane of
    wind and building a fire for the stew-pot. It remained, just
    enough to bother and perplex, and to rob a most delightful
    camping-ground of a good portion of its charm. To my companion,
    however, I said nothing, for he was a man I considered devoid
    of imagination. In the first place, I could never have
    explained to him what I meant, and in the second, he would have
    laughed stupidly at me if I had.
There was a slight depression in the center of the island,
    and here we pitched the tent. The surrounding willows broke the
    wind a bit.
"A poor camp," observed the imperturbable Swede when at last
    the tent stood upright; "no stones and precious little
    firewood. I'm for moving on early to-morrow—eh? This sand
    won't hold anything."
But the experience of a collapsing tent at midnight had
    taught us many devices, and we made the cosy gipsy house as
    safe as possible, and then set about collecting a store of wood
    to last till bedtime. Willow bushes drop no branches, and
    driftwood was our only source of supply. We hunted the shores
    pretty thoroughly. Everywhere the banks were crumbling as the
    rising flood tore at them and carried away great portions with
    a splash and a gurgle.
"The island's much smaller than when we landed," said the
    accurate Swede. "It won't last long at this rate. We'd better
    drag the canoe close to the tent, and be ready to start at a
    moment's notice. I shall sleep in my clothes."
He was a little distance off, climbing along the bank, and I
    heard his rather jolly laugh as he spoke.
"By Jove!" I heard him call, a moment later, and turned to
    see what had caused his exclamation; but for the moment he was
    hidden by the willows, and I could not find him.
"What in the world's this?" I heard him cry again, and this
    time his voice had become serious.
I ran up quickly and joined him on the bank. He was looking
    over the river, pointing at something in the water.
"Good Heavens, it's a man's body!" he cried excitedly.
    "Look!"
A black thing, turning over and over in the foaming waves,
    swept rapidly past. It kept disappearing and coming up to the
    surface again. It was about twenty feet from the shore, and
    just as it was opposite to where we stood it lurched round and
    looked straight at us. We saw its eyes reflecting the sunset,
    and gleaming an odd yellow as the body turned over. Then it
    gave a swift, gulping plunge, and dived out of sight in a
    flash.
"An otter, by gad!" we exclaimed in the same breath,
    laughing.
It was an otter, alive, and out on the hunt; yet it
    had looked exactly like the body of a drowned man turning
    helplessly in the current. Far below it came to the surface
    once again, and we saw its black skin, wet and shining in the
    sunlight.
Then, too, just as we turned back, our arms full of
    driftwood, another thing happened to recall us to the river
    bank. This time it really was a man, and what was more, a man
    in a boat. Now a small boat on the Danube was an unusual sight
    at any time, but here in this deserted region, and at flood
    time, it was so unexpected as to constitute a real event. We
    stood and stared.
Whether it was due to the slanting sunlight, or the
    refraction from the wonderfully illumined water, I cannot say,
    but, whatever the cause, I found it difficult to focus my sight
    properly upon the flying apparition. It seemed, however, to be
    a man standing upright in a sort of flat-bottomed boat,
    steering with a long oar, and being carried down the opposite
    shore at a tremendous pace. He apparently was looking across in
    our direction, but the distance was too great and the light too
    uncertain for us to make out very plainly what he was about. It
    seemed to me that he was gesticulating and making signs at us.
    His voice came across the water to us shouting something
    furiously but the wind drowned it so that no single word was
    audible. There was something curious about the whole
    appearance—man, boat, signs, voice—that made an
    impression on me out of all proportion to its cause.
"He's crossing himself!" I cried. "Look, he's making the
    sign of the cross!"
"I believe you're right," the Swede said, shading his eyes
    with his hand and watching the man out of sight. He seemed to
    be gone in a moment, melting away down there into the sea of
    willows where the sun caught them in the bend of the river and
    turned them into a great crimson wall of beauty. Mist, too, had
    begun to rise, so that the air was hazy.
"But what in the world is he doing at nightfall on this
    flooded river?" I said, half to myself. "Where is he going at
    such a time, and what did he mean by his signs and shouting?
    D'you think he wished to warn us about something?"
"He saw our smoke, and thought we were spirits probably,"
    laughed my companion. "These Hungarians believe in all sorts of
    rubbish: you remember the shopwoman at Pressburg warning us
    that no one ever landed here because it belonged to some sort
    of beings outside man's world! I suppose they believe in
    fairies and elementals, possibly demons too. That peasant in
    the boat saw people on the islands for the first time in his
    life," he added, after a slight pause, "and it scared him,
    that's all." The Swede's tone of voice was not convincing, and
    his manner lacked something that was usually there. I noted the
    change instantly while he talked, though without being able to
    label it precisely.
"If they had enough imagination," I laughed loudly—I
    remember trying to make as much noise as I
    could—"they might well people a place like this with the
    old gods of antiquity. The Romans must have haunted all this
    region more or less with their shrines and sacred groves and
    elemental deities."
The subject dropped and we returned to our stew-pot, for my
    friend was not given to imaginative conversation as a rule.
    Moreover, just then I remember feeling distinctly glad that he
    was not imaginative; his stolid, practical nature suddenly
    seemed to me welcome and comforting. It was an admirable
    temperament, I felt: he could steer down rapids like a red
    Indian, shoot dangerous bridges and whirlpools better than any
    white man I ever saw in a canoe. He was a grand fellow for an
    adventurous trip, a tower of strength when untoward things
    happened. I looked at his strong face and light curly hair as
    he staggered along under his pile of driftwood (twice the size
    of mine!), and I experienced a feeling of relief. Yes, I was
    distinctly glad just then that the Swede was—what he was,
    and that he never made remarks that suggested more than they
    said.
"The river's still rising, though," he added, as if
    following out some thoughts of his own, and dropping his load
    with a gasp. "This island will be under water in two days if it
    goes on."
"I wish the wind would go down," I said. "I don't
    care a fig for the river."
The flood, indeed, had no terrors for us; we could get off
    at ten minutes' notice, and the more water the better we liked
    it. It meant an increasing current and the obliteration of the
    treacherous shingle-beds that so often threatened to tear the
    bottom out of our canoe.
Contrary to our expectations, the wind did not go down with
    the sun. It seemed to increase with the darkness, howling
    overhead and shaking the willows round us like straws. Curious
    sounds accompanied it sometimes, like the explosion of heavy
    guns, and it fell upon the water and the island in great flat
    blows of immense power. It made me think of the sounds a planet
    must make, could we only hear it, driving along through
    space.
But the sky kept wholly clear of clouds, and soon after
    supper the full moon rose up in the east and covered the river
    and the plain of shouting willows with a light like the
    day.
We lay on the sandy patch beside the fire, smoking,
    listening to the noises of the night round us, and talking
    happily of the journey we had already made, and of our plans
    ahead. The map lay spread in the door of the tent, but the high
    wind made it hard to study, and presently we lowered the
    curtain and extinguished the lantern. The firelight was enough
    to smoke and see each other's faces by, and the sparks flew
    about overhead like fireworks. A few yards beyond, the river
    gurgled and hissed, and from time to time a heavy splash
    announced the falling away of further portions of the bank.
Our talk, I noticed, had to do with the far-away scenes and
    incidents of our first camps in the Black Forest, or of other
    subjects altogether remote from the present setting, for
    neither of us spoke of the actual moment more than was
    necessary—almost as though we had agreed tacitly to avoid
    discussion of the camp and its incidents. Neither the otter nor
    the boatman, for instance, received the honor of a single
    mention, though ordinarily these would have furnished
    discussion for the greater part of the evening. They were, of
    course, distinct events in such a place.
The scarcity of wood made it a business to keep the fire
    going, for the wind, that drove the smoke in our faces wherever
    we sat, helped at the same time to make a forced draught. We
    took it in turn to make foraging expeditions into the darkness,
    and the quantity the Swede brought back always made me feel
    that he took an absurdly long time finding it; for the fact was
    I did not care much about being left alone, and yet it always
    seemed to be my turn to grub about among the bushes or scramble
    along the slippery banks in the moonlight. The long day's
    battle with wind and water—such wind and such
    water!—had tired us both, and an early bed was the
    obvious program. Yet neither of us made the move for the tent.
    We lay there, tending the fire, talking in desultory fashion,
    peering about us into the dense willow bushes, and listening to
    the thunder of wind and river. The loneliness of the place had
    entered our very bones, and silence seemed natural, for after a
    bit the sound of our voices became a trifle unreal and forced;
    whispering would have been the fitting mode of communication, I
    felt, and the human voice, always rather absurd amid the roar
    of the elements, now carried with it something almost
    illegitimate. It was like talking out loud in church, or in
    some place where it was not lawful, perhaps not quite
    safe, to be overheard.
The eeriness of this lonely island, set among a million
    willows, swept by a hurricane, and surrounded by hurrying deep
    waters, touched us both, I fancy. Untrodden by man, almost
    unknown to man, it lay there beneath the moon, remote from
    human influence, on the frontier of another world, an alien
    world, a world tenanted by willows only and the souls of
    willows. And we, in our rashness, had dared to invade it, even
    to make use of it! Something more than the power of its mystery
    stirred in me as I lay on the sand, feet to fire, and peered up
    through the leaves at the stars. For the last time I rose to
    get firewood.
"When this has burnt up," I said firmly, "I shall turn in,"
    and my companion watched me lazily as I moved off into the
    surrounding shadows.
For an unimaginative man I thought he seemed unusually
    receptive that night, unusually open to suggestion of things
    other than sensory. He too was touched by the beauty and
    loneliness of the place. I was not altogether pleased, I
    remember, to recognize this slight change in him, and instead
    of immediately collecting sticks, I made my way to the far
    point of the island where the moonlight on plain and river
    could be seen to better advantage. The desire to be alone had
    come suddenly upon me; my former dread returned in force; there
    was a vague feeling in me I wished to face and probe to the
    bottom.
When I reached the point of sand jutting out among the
    waves, the spell of the place descended upon me with a positive
    shock. No mere "scenery" could have produced such an effect.
    There was something more here, something to alarm.
I gazed across the waste of wild waters; I watched the
    whispering willows; I heard the ceaseless beating of the
    tireless wind; and, one and all, each in its own way, stirred
    in me this sensation of a strange distress. But the
    willows especially: for ever they went on chattering
    and talking among themselves, laughing a little, shrilly crying
    out, sometimes sighing—but what it was they made so much
    to-do about belonged to the secret life of the great plain they
    inhabited. And it was utterly alien to the world I knew, or to
    that of the wild yet kindly elements. They made me think of a
    host of beings from another plane of life, another evolution
    altogether, perhaps, all discussing a mystery known only to
    themselves. I watched them moving busily together, oddly
    shaking their big bushy heads, twirling their myriad leaves
    even when there was no wind. They moved of their own will as
    though alive, and they touched, by some incalculable method, my
    own keen sense of the horrible.
There they stood in the moonlight, like a vast army
    surrounding our camp, shaking their innumerable silver spears
    defiantly, formed all ready for an attack.
The psychology of places, for some imaginations at least, is
    very vivid; for the wanderer, especially, camps have their
    "note" either of welcome or rejection. At first it may not
    always be apparent, because the busy preparations of tent and
    cooking prevent, but with the first pause—after supper
    usually—it comes and announces itself. And the note of
    this willow-camp now became unmistakably plain to me: we were
    interlopers, trespassers, we were not welcomed. The sense of
    unfamiliarity grew upon me as I stood there watching. We
    touched the frontier of a region where our presence was
    resented. For a night's lodging we might perhaps be tolerated;
    but for a prolonged and inquisitive stay—No! by all the
    gods of the trees and the wilderness, no! We were the first
    human influences upon this island, and we were not wanted.
    The willows were against us.
Strange thoughts like these, bizarre fancies, borne I know
    not whence, found lodgment in my mind as I stood listening.
    What, I thought, if, after all, these crouching willows proved
    to be alive; if suddenly they should rise up, like a swarm of
    living creatures, marshaled by the gods whose territory we had
    invaded, sweep towards us off the vast swamps, booming overhead
    in the night—and then settle down! As I looked
    it was so easy to imagine they actually moved, crept nearer,
    retreated a little, huddled together in masses, hostile,
    waiting for the great wind that should finally start them
    a-running. I could have sworn their aspect changed a little,
    and their ranks deepened and pressed more closely together.
The melancholy shrill cry of a night bird sounded overhead,
    and suddenly I nearly lost my balance as the piece of bank I
    stood upon fell with a great splash into the river, undermined
    by the flood. I stepped back just in time, and went on hunting
    for firewood again, half laughing at the odd fancies that
    crowded so thickly into my mind and cast their spell upon me. I
    recall the Swede's remark about moving on next day, and I was
    just thinking that I fully agreed with him, when I turned with
    a start and saw the subject of my thoughts standing immediately
    in front of me. He was quite close. The roar of the elements
    had covered his approach.
"You've been gone so long," he shouted above the wind, "I
    thought something must have happened to you."
But there was that in his tone, and a certain look in his
    face as well, that conveyed to me more than his actual words,
    and in a flash I understood the real reason for his coming. It
    was because the spell of the place had entered his soul too,
    and he did not like being alone.
"River still rising," he cried, pointing to the flood in the
    moonlight, "and the wind's simply awful."
He always said the same things, but it was the cry for
    companionship that gave the real importance to his words.
"Lucky," I cried back, "our tent's in the hollow. I think
    it'll hold all right." I added something about the difficulty
    of finding wood, in order to explain my absence, but the wind
    caught my words and flung them across the river, so that he did
    not hear, but just looked at me through the branches, nodding
    his head.
"Lucky if we get away without disaster!" he shouted, or
    words to that effect; and I remember feeling half angry with
    him for putting the thought into words, for it was exactly what
    I felt myself. There was disaster impending somewhere, and the
    sense of presentiment lay unpleasantly upon me.
We went back to the fire and made a final blaze, poking it
    up with our feet. We took a last look round. But for the wind
    the heat would have been unpleasant. I put this thought into
    words, and I remember my friend's reply struck me oddly: that
    he would rather have the heat, the ordinary July weather, than
    this "diabolical wind."
Everything was snug for the night; the canoe lying turned
    over beside the tent, with both yellow paddles beneath her; the
    provision sack hanging from a willow stem, and the washed-up
    dishes removed to a safe distance from the fire, all ready for
    the morning meal.
We smothered the embers of the fire with sand, and then
    turned in. The flap of the tent door was up, and I saw the
    branches and the stars and the white moonlight. The shaking
    willows and the heavy buffetings of the wind against our taut
    little house were the last things I remembered as sleep came
    down and covered all with its soft and delicious
    forgetfulness.
II
Suddenly I found myself lying awake, peering from my sandy
    mattress through the door of the tent. I looked at my watch
    pinned against the canvas, and saw by the bright moonlight that
    it was past twelve o'clock—the threshold of a new
    day—and I had therefore slept a couple of hours. The
    Swede was asleep still beside me; the wind howled as before
    something plucked at my heart and made me feel afraid. There
    was a sense of disturbance in my immediate neighborhood.
I sat up quickly and looked out. The trees were swaying
    violently to and fro as the gusts smote them, but our little
    bit of green canvas lay snugly safe in the hollow, for the wind
    passed over it without meeting enough resistance to make it
    vicious. The feeling of disquietude did not pass however, and I
    crawled quietly out of the tent to see if our belongings were
    safe. I moved carefully so as not to waken my companion. A
    curious excitement was on me.
I was halfway out, kneeling on all fours, when my eye first
    took in that the tops of the bushes opposite, with their moving
    tracery of leaves, made shapes against the sky. I sat back on
    my haunches and stared. It was incredible, surely, but there,
    opposite and slightly above me, were shapes of some
    indeterminate sort among the willows, and as the branches
    swayed in the wind they seemed to group themselves about these
    shapes, forming a series of monstrous outlines that shifted
    rapidly beneath the moon. Close, about fifty feet in front of
    me, I saw these things.
My first instinct was to waken my companion that he too
    might see them, but something made me hesitate—the sudden
    realization, probably, that I should not welcome corroboration;
    and meanwhile I crouched there staring in amazement with
    smarting eyes. I was wide awake. I remember saying to myself
    that I was not dreaming.
They first became properly visible, these huge figures, just
    within the tops of the bushes—immense bronze-colored,
    moving, and wholly independent of the swaying of the branches.
    I saw them plainly and noted, now I came to examine them more
    calmly, that they were very much larger than human, and indeed
    that something in their appearance proclaimed them to be
    not human at all. Certainly they were not merely the
    moving tracery of the branches against the moonlight. They
    shifted independently. They rose upwards in a continuous stream
    from earth to sky, vanishing utterly as soon as they reached
    the dark of the sky. They were interlaced one with another,
    making a great column, and I saw their limbs and huge bodies
    melting in and out of each other, forming this serpentine line
    that bent and swayed and twisted spirally with the contortions
    of the wind-tossed trees. They were nude, fluid shapes, passing
    up the bushes, within the leaves almost—rising
    up in a living column into the heavens. Their faces I never
    could see. Unceasingly they poured upwards, swaying in great
    bending curves, with a hue of dull bronze upon their skins.
I stared, trying to force every atom of vision from my eyes.
    For a long time I thought they must every moment
    disappear and resolve themselves into the movements of the
    branches and prove to be an optical illusion. I searched
    everywhere for a proof of reality, when all the while I
    understood quite well that the standard of reality had changed.
    For the longer I looked the more certain I became that these
    figures were real and living, though perhaps not according to
    the standards that the camera and the biologist would insist
    upon.
Far from feeling fear, I was possessed with a sense of awe
    and wonder such as I have never known. I seemed to be gazing at
    the personified elemental forces of this haunted and primeval
    region. Our intrusion had stirred the powers of the place into
    activity. It was we who were the cause of the disturbance, and
    my brain filled to bursting with stories and legends of the
    spirits and deities of places that have been acknowledged and
    worshiped by men in all ages of the world's history. But,
    before I could arrive at any possible explanation, something
    impelled me to go farther out, and I crept forward on to the
    sand and stood upright. I felt the ground still warm under my
    bare feet; the wind tore at my hair and face; and the sound of
    the river burst upon my ears with a sudden roar. These things,
    I knew, were real, and proved that my senses were acting
    normally. Yet the figures still rose from earth to heaven,
    silent, majestically, in a great spiral of grace and strength
    that overwhelmed me at length with a genuine deep emotion of
    worship. I felt that I must fall down and
    worship—absolutely worship.
Perhaps in another minute I might have done so, when a gust
    of wind swept against me with such force that it blew me
    sideways, and I nearly stumbled and fell. It seemed to shake
    the dream violently out of me. At least it gave me another
    point of view somehow. The figures still remained, still
    ascended into heaven from the heart of the night, but my reason
    at last began to assert itself. It must be a subjective
    experience, I argued—none the less real for that, but
    still subjective. The moonlight and the branches combined to
    work out these pictures upon the mirror of my imagination, and
    for some reason I projected them outwards and made them appear
    objective. I knew this must be the case, of course. I was the
    subject of a vivid and interesting hallucination. I took
    courage, and began to move forward across the open patches of
    sand. By Jove, though, was it all hallucination? Was it merely
    subjective? Did not my reason argue in the old futile way from
    the little standard of the known?
I only know that great column of figures ascended darkly
    into the sky for what seemed a very long period of time, and
    with a very complete measure of reality as most men are
    accustomed to gauge reality. Then suddenly they were gone!
And, once they were gone and the immediate wonder of their
    great presence had passed, fear came down upon me with a cold
    rush. The esoteric meaning of this lonely and haunted region
    suddenly flamed up within me and I began to tremble dreadfully.
    I took a quick look round—a look of horror that came near
    to panic—calculating vainly ways of escape; and then,
    realizing how helpless I was to achieve anything really
    effective, I crept back silently into the tent and lay down
    again upon my sandy mattress, first lowering the door-curtain
    to shut out the sight of the willows in the moonlight, and then
    burying my head as deeply as possible beneath the blankets to
    deaden the sound of the terrifying wind.
III
As though further to convince me that I had not been
    dreaming, I remember that it was a long time before I fell
    again into a troubled and restless sleep; and even then only
    the upper crust of me slept, and underneath there was something
    that never quite lost consciousness, but lay alert and on the
    watch.
But this second time I jumped up with a genuine start of
    terror. It was neither the wind nor the river that woke me, but
    the slow approach of something that caused the sleeping portion
    of me to grow smaller and smaller till at last it vanished
    altogether, and I found myself sitting bolt
    upright—listening.
Outside there was a sound of multitudinous little
    patterings. They had been coming, I was aware, for a long time,
    and in my sleep they had first become audible. I sat there
    nervously wide awake as though I had not slept at all. It
    seemed to me that my breathing came with difficulty, and that
    there was a great weight upon the surface of my body. In spite
    of the hot night, I felt clammy with cold and shivered.
    Something surely was pressing steadily against the sides of the
    tent and weighing down upon it from above. Was it the body of
    the wind? Was this the pattering rain, the dripping of the
    leaves? The spray blown from the river by the wind and
    gathering in big drops? I thought quickly of a dozen
    things.
Then suddenly the explanation leaped into my mind: a bough
    from the poplar, the only large tree on the island, had fallen
    with the wind. Still half caught by the other branches, it
    would fall with the next gust and crush us, and meanwhile its
    leaves brushed and tapped upon the tight canvas surface of the
    tent. I raised the loose flap and rushed out, calling to the
    Swede to follow.
But when I got out and stood upright I saw that the tent was
    free. There was no hanging bough; there was no rain or spray;
    nothing approached.
A cold, gray light filtered down through the bushes and lay
    on the faintly gleaming sand. Stars still crowded the sky
    directly overhead, and the wind howled magnificently, but the
    fire no longer gave out any glow, and I saw the east reddening
    in streaks through the trees. Several hours must have passed
    since I stood there before, watching the ascending figures, and
    the memory of it now came back to me horribly, like an evil
    dream. Oh, how tired it made me feel, that ceaseless raging
    wind! Yet, though the deep lassitude of a sleepless night was
    on me, my nerves were tingling with the activity of an equally
    tireless apprehension, and all idea of repose was out of the
    question. The river I saw had risen further. Its thunder filled
    the air, and a fine spray made itself felt through my thin
    sleeping shirt.
Yet nowhere did I discover the slightest evidences of
    anything to cause alarm. This deep, prolonged disturbance in my
    heart remained wholly unaccounted for.
My companion had not stirred when I called him, and there
    was no need to waken him now. I looked about me carefully,
    noting everything: the turned-over canoe; the yellow
    paddles—two of them, I'm certain; the provision sack and
    the extra lantern hanging together from the tree; and, crowding
    everywhere about me, enveloping all, the willows, those
    endless, shaking willows. A bird uttered its morning cry, and a
    string of duck passed with whirring flight overhead in the
    twilight. The sand whirled, dry and stinging, about my bare
    feet in the wind.
I walked round the tent and then went out a little way into
    the bush, so that I could see across the river to the farther
    landscape, and the same profound yet indefinable emotion of
    distress seized upon me again as I saw the interminable sea of
    bushes stretching to the horizon, looking ghostly and unreal in
    the wan light of dawn. I walked softly here and there, still
    puzzling over that odd sound of infinite pattering, and of that
    pressure upon the tent that had wakened me. It must
    have been the wind, I reflected—the wind beating upon the
    loose, hot sand, driving the dry particles smartly against the
    taut canvas—the wind dropping heavily upon our fragile
    roof.
Yet all the time my nervousness and malaise increased
    appreciably.
I crossed over to the farther shore and noted how the coast
    line had altered in the night, and what masses of sand the
    river had torn away. I dipped my hands and feet into the cool
    current, and bathed my forehead. Already there was a glow of
    sunrise in the sky and the exquisite freshness of coming day.
    On my way back I passed purposely beneath the very bushes where
    I had seen the column of figures rising into the air, and
    midway among the clumps I suddenly found myself overtaken by a
    sense of vast terror. From the shadows a large figure went
    swiftly by. Some one passed me, as sure as ever man did....
It was a great staggering blow from the wind that helped me
    forward again, and once out in the more open space, the sense
    of terror diminished strangely. The winds were about and
    walking, I remember saying to myself; for the winds often move
    like great presences under the trees. And altogether the fear
    that hovered about me was such an unknown and immense kind of
    fear, so unlike anything I had ever felt before, that it woke a
    sense of awe and wonder in me that did much to counteract its
    worst effects; and when I reached a high point in the middle of
    the island from which I could see the wide stretch of river,
    crimson in the sunrise, the whole magical beauty of it all was
    so overpowering that a sort of wild yearning woke in me and
    almost brought a cry up into the throat.
But this cry found no expression, for as my eyes wandered
    from the plain beyond to the island round me and noted our
    little tent half hidden among the willows, a dreadful discovery
    leaped out at me, compared to which my terror of the walking
    winds seemed as nothing at all.
For a change, I thought, had somehow come about in the
    arrangement of the landscape. It was not that my point of
    vantage gave me a different view, but that an alteration had
    apparently been effected in the relation of the tent to the
    willows, and of the willows to the tent. Surely the bushes now
    crowded much closer—unnecessarily, unpleasantly close.
    They had moved nearer.
Creeping with silent feet over the shifting sands, drawing
    imperceptibly nearer by soft, unhurried movements, the willows
    had come closer during the night. But had the wind moved them,
    or had they moved of themselves? I recalled the sound of
    infinite small patterings and the pressure upon the tent and
    upon my own heart that caused me to wake in terror. I swayed
    for a moment in the wind like a tree, finding it hard to keep
    my upright position on the sandy hillock. There was a
    suggestion here of personal agency, of deliberate intention, of
    aggressive hostility, and it terrified me into a sort of
    rigidity.
Then the reaction followed quickly. The idea was so bizarre,
    so absurd, that I felt inclined to laugh. But the laughter came
    no more readily than the cry, for the knowledge that my mind
    was so receptive to such dangerous imaginings brought the
    additional terror that it was through our minds and not through
    our physical bodies that the attack would come, and was
    coming.
The wind buffeted me about, and, very quickly it seemed, the
    sun came up over the horizon, for it was after four o'clock,
    and I must have stood on that little pinnacle of sand longer
    than I knew, afraid to come down at close quarters with the
    willows. I returned quietly, creepily, to the tent, first
    taking another exhaustive look round and—yes, I confess
    it—making a few measurements. I paced out on the warm
    sand the distances between the willows and the tent, making a
    note of the shortest distance particularly.
I crawled stealthily into my blankets. My companion, to all
    appearances, still slept soundly, and I was glad that this was
    so. Provided my experiences were not corroborated, I could find
    strength somehow to deny them, perhaps. With the daylight I
    could persuade myself that it was all a subjective
    hallucination, a fantasy of the night, a projection of the
    excited imagination.
Nothing further came to disturb me, and I fell asleep almost
    at once, utterly exhausted, yet still in dread of hearing again
    that weird sound of multitudinous pattering, or of feeling the
    pressure upon my heart that had made it difficult to
    breathe.
IV
The sun was high in the heavens when my companion woke me
    from a heavy sleep and announced that the porridge was cooked
    and there was just time to bathe. The grateful smell of
    frizzling bacon entered the tent door.
"River still rising," he said, "and several islands out in
    midstream have disappeared altogether. Our own island's much
    smaller."
"Any wood left?" I asked sleepily.
"The wood and the island will finish to-morrow in a dead
    heat," he laughed, "but there's enough to last us till
    then."
I plunged in from the point of the island, which had indeed
    altered a lot in size and shape during the night, and was swept
    down in a moment to the landing place opposite the tent. The
    water was icy, and the banks flew by like the country from an
    express train. Bathing under such conditions was an
    exhilarating operation, and the terror of the night seemed
    cleansed out of me by a process of evaporation in the brain.
    The sun was blazing hot; not a cloud showed itself anywhere;
    the wind, however, had not abated one little jot.
Quite suddenly then the implied meaning of the Swede's words
    flashed across me, showing that he no longer wished to leave
    posthaste, and had changed his mind. "Enough to last till
    to-morrow"—he assumed we should stay on the island
    another night. It struck me as odd. The night before he was so
    positive the other way. How had the change come about?
Great crumblings of the banks occurred at breakfast, with
    heavy splashings and clouds of spray which the wind brought
    into our frying-pan, and my fellow-traveler talked incessantly
    about the difficulty the Vienna-Pesth steamers must have to
    find the channel in flood. But the state of his mind interested
    and impressed me far more than the state of the river or the
    difficulties of the steamers. He had changed somehow since the
    evening before. His manner was different—a trifle
    excited, a trifle shy, with a sort of suspicion about his voice
    and gestures. I hardly know how to describe it now in cold
    blood, but at the time I remember being quite certain of one
    thing, viz., that he had become frightened!
He ate very little breakfast, and for once omitted to smoke
    his pipe. He had the map spread open beside him, and kept
    studying its markings.
"We'd better get off sharp in an hour," I said presently,
    feeling for an opening that must bring him indirectly to a
    partial confession at any rate. And his answer puzzled me
    uncomfortably: "Rather! If they'll let us."
"Who'll let us? The elements?" I asked quickly, with
    affected indifference.
"The powers of this awful place, whoever they are," he
    replied, keeping his eyes on the map. "The gods are here, if
    they are anywhere at all in the world."
"The elements are always the true immortals," I replied,
    laughing as naturally as I could manage, yet knowing quite well
    that my face reflected my true feelings when he looked up
    gravely at me and spoke across the smoke:
"We shall be fortunate if we get away without further
    disaster."
This was exactly what I had dreaded, and I screwed myself up
    to the point of the direct question. It was like agreeing to
    allow the dentist to extract the tooth; it had to come
    anyhow in the long run, and the rest was all pretense.
"Further disaster! Why, what's happened?"
"For one thing—the steering paddle's gone," he said
    quietly.
"The steering paddle gone!" I repeated, greatly excited, for
    this was our rudder, and the Danube in flood without a rudder
    was suicide. "But what——"
"And there's a tear in the bottom of the canoe," he added,
    with a genuine little tremor in his voice.
I continued staring at him, able only to repeat the words in
    his face somewhat foolishly. There, in the heat of the sun, and
    on this burning sand, I was aware of a freezing atmosphere
    descending round us. I got up to follow him, for he merely
    nodded his head gravely and led the way towards the tent a few
    yards on the other side of the fireplace. The canoe still lay
    there as I had last seen her in the night, ribs uppermost, the
    paddles, or rather, the paddle, on the sand beside
    her.
"There's only one," he said, stooping to pick it up. "And
    here's the rent in the base-board."
It was on the tip of my tongue to tell him that I had
    clearly noticed two paddles a few hours before, but a
    second impulse made me think better of it, and I said nothing.
    I approached to see.
There was a long, finely made tear in the bottom of the
    canoe where a little slither of wood had been neatly taken
    clean out; it looked as if the tooth of a sharp rock or snag
    had eaten down her length, and investigation showed that the
    hole went through. Had we launched out in her without observing
    it we must inevitably have foundered. At first the water would
    have made the wood swell so as to close the hole, but once out
    in midstream the water must have poured in, and the canoe,
    never more than two inches above the surface, would have filled
    and sunk very rapidly.
"There, you see, an attempt to prepare a victim for the
    sacrifice," I heard him saying, more to himself than to me,
    "two victims rather," he added as he bent over and ran his
    fingers along the slit.
I began to whistle—a thing I always do unconsciously
    when utterly nonplused—and purposely paid no attention to
    his words. I was determined to consider them foolish.
"It wasn't there last night," he said presently,
    straightening up from his examination and looking anywhere but
    at me.
"We must have scratched her in landing, of course," I
    stopped whistling to say, "The stones are very
    sharp——"
I stopped abruptly, for at that moment he turned round and
    met my eye squarely. I knew just as well as he did how
    impossible my explanation was. There were no stones, to begin
    with.
"And then there's this to explain too," he added quietly,
    handing me the paddle and pointing to the blade.
A new and curious emotion spread freezingly over me as I
    took and examined it. The blade was scraped down all over,
    beautifully scraped, as though someone had sand-papered it with
    care, making it so thin that the first vigorous stroke must
    have snapped it off at the elbow.
"One of us walked in his sleep and did this thing," I said
    feebly, "or—or it has been filed by the constant stream
    of sand particles blown against it by the wind, perhaps."
"Ah," said the Swede, turning away, laughing a little, "you
    can explain everything!"
"The same wind that caught the steering paddle and flung it
    so near the bank that it fell in with the next lump that
    crumbled," I called out after him, absolutely determined to
    find an explanation for everything he showed me.
"I see," he shouted back, turning his head to look at me
    before disappearing among the willow bushes.
Once alone with these perplexing evidences of personal
    agency, I think my first thought took the form of "One of us
    must have done this thing, and it certainly was not I." But my
    second thought decided how impossible it was to suppose, under
    all the circumstances, that either of us had done it. That my
    companion, the trusted friend of a dozen similar expeditions,
    could have knowingly had a hand in it, was a suggestion not to
    be entertained for a moment. Equally absurd seemed the
    explanation that this imperturbable and densely practical
    nature had suddenly become insane and was busied with insane
    purposes.
Yet the fact remained that what disturbed me most, and kept
    my fear actively alive even in this blaze of sunshine and wild
    beauty, was the clear certainty that some curious alteration
    had come about in his mind—that he was nervous,
    timid, suspicious, aware of goings on he did not speak about,
    watching a series of secret and hitherto unmentionable
    events—waiting, in a word, for a climax that he expected,
    and, I thought, expected very soon. This grew up in my mind
    intuitively—I hardly knew how.
I made a hurried examination of the tent and its
    surroundings, but the measurements of the night remained the
    same. There were deep hollows formed in the sand, I now noticed
    for the first time, basin-shaped and of various depths and
    sizes, varying from that of a teacup to a large bowl. The wind,
    no doubt, was responsible for these miniature craters, just as
    it was for lifting the paddle and tossing it towards the water.
    The rent in the canoe was the only thing that seemed quite
    inexplicable; and, after all, it was conceivable that
    a sharp point had caught it when we landed. The examination I
    made of the shore did not assist this theory, but all the same
    I clung to it with that diminishing portion of my intelligence
    which I called my "reason." An explanation of some kind was an
    absolute necessity, just as some working explanation of the
    universe is necessary—however absurd—to the
    happiness of every individual who seeks to do his duty in the
    world and face the problems of life. The simile seemed to me at
    the time an exact parallel.
I at once set the pitch melting, and presently the Swede
    joined me at the work, though under the best conditions in the
    world the canoe could not be safe for traveling till the
    following day. I drew his attention casually to the hollows in
    the sand.
"Yes," he said, "I know. They're all over the island. But
    you can explain them, no doubt!"
"Wind, of course," I answered without hesitation. "Have you
    never watched those little whirlwinds in the street that twist
    and twirl everything into a circle? This sand's loose enough to
    yield, that's all."
He made no reply, and we worked on in silence for a bit. I
    watched him surreptitiously all the time, and I had an idea he
    was watching me. He seemed, too, to be always listening
    attentively to something I could not hear, or perhaps for
    something that he expected to hear, for he kept turning about
    and staring into the bushes, and up into the sky, and out
    across the water where it was visible through the openings
    among the willows. Sometimes he even put his hand to his ear
    and held it there for several minutes. He said nothing to me,
    however, about it, and I asked no questions. And meanwhile, as
    he mended that torn canoe with the skill and address of a red
    Indian, I was glad to notice his absorption in the work, for
    there was a vague dread in my heart that he would speak of the
    changed aspect of the willows. And, if he had noticed
    that, my imagination could no longer be held a
    sufficient explanation of it.
At length, after a long pause, he began to talk.
"Queer thing," he added in a hurried sort of voice, as
    though he wanted to say something and get it over. "Queer
    thing, I mean, about that otter last night."
I had expected something so totally different that he caught
    me with surprise, and I looked up sharply.
"Shows how lonely this place is. Otters are awfully shy
    things—"
"I don't mean that, of course," he interrupted. "I
    mean—do you think—did you think it really was an
    otter?"
"What else, in the name of Heaven, what else?"
"You know, I saw it before you did, and at first it
    seemed—so much bigger than an otter."
"The sunset as you looked upstream magnified it, or
    something," I replied.
He looked at me absently a moment, as though his mind were
    busy with other thoughts.
"It had such extraordinary yellow eyes," he went on half to
    himself.
"That was the sun too," I laughed, a trifle boisterously. "I
    suppose you'll wonder next if that fellow in the
    boat——"
I suddenly decided not to finish the sentence. He was in the
    act again of listening, turning his head to the wind, and
    something in the expression of his face made me halt. The
    subject dropped, and we went on with our caulking. Apparently
    he had not noticed my unfinished sentence. Five minutes later,
    however, he looked at me across the canoe, the smoking pitch in
    his hand, his face exceedingly grave.
"I did rather wonder, if you want to know," he said
    slowly, "what that thing in the boat was. I remember thinking
    at the time it was not a man. The whole business seemed to rise
    quite suddenly out of the water."
I laughed again boisterously in his face, but this time
    there was impatience and a strain of anger too, in my
    feeling.
"Look here now," I cried, "this place is quite queer enough
    without going out of our way to imagine things! That boat was
    an ordinary boat, and the man in it was an ordinary man, and
    they were both going downstream as fast as they could lick. And
    that otter was an otter, so don't let's play the fool
    about it!"
He looked steadily at me with the same grave expression. He
    was not in the least annoyed. I took courage from his
    silence.
"And for heaven's sake," I went on, "don't keep pretending
    you hear things, because it only gives me the jumps, and
    there's nothing to hear but the river and this cursed old
    thundering wind."
"You fool!" he answered in a low, shocked voice,
    "you utter fool. That's just the way all victims talk. As if
    you didn't understand just as well as I do!" he sneered with
    scorn in his voice, and a sort of resignation. "The best thing
    you can do is to keep quiet and try to hold your mind as firm
    as possible. This feeble attempt at self-deception only makes
    the truth harder when you're forced to meet it."
My little effort was over, and I found nothing more to say,
    for I knew quite well his words were true, and that I was the
    fool, not he. Up to a certain stage in the adventure
    he kept ahead of me easily, and I think I felt annoyed to be
    out of it, to be thus proved less psychic, less sensitive than
    himself to these extraordinary happenings, and half ignorant
    all the time of what was going on under my very nose. He
    knew from the very beginning, apparently. But at the
    moment I wholly missed the point of his words about the
    necessity of there being a victim, and that we ourselves were
    destined to satisfy the want. I dropped all pretense
    thenceforward, but thenceforward likewise my fear increased
    steadily to the climax.
"But you're quite right about one thing," he added, before
    the subject passed, "and that is that we're wiser not to talk
    about it, or even to think about it, because what one
    thinks finds expression in words, and what one
    says, happens."
That afternoon, while the canoe dried and hardened, we spent
    trying to fish, testing the leak, collecting wood, and watching
    the enormous flood of rising water. Masses of driftwood swept
    near our shores sometimes, and we fished for them with long
    willow branches. The island grew perceptibly smaller as the
    banks were torn away with great gulps and splashes. The weather
    kept brilliantly fine till about four o'clock, and then for the
    first time for three days the wind showed signs of abating.
    Clouds began to gather in the southwest, spreading thence
    slowly over the sky.
This lessening of the wind came as a great relief, for the
    incessant roaring, banging, and thundering had irritated our
    nerves. Yet the silence that came about five o'clock with its
    sudden cessation was in a manner quite as oppressive. The
    booming of the river had everything its own way then: it filled
    the air with deep murmurs, more musical than the wind noises,
    but infinitely more monotonous. The wind held many notes,
    rising, falling, always beating out some sort of great
    elemental tune; whereas the river's song lay between three
    notes at most—dull pedal notes, that held a lugubrious
    quality foreign to the wind, and somehow seemed to me, in my
    then nervous state, to sound wonderfully well the music of
    doom.
It was extraordinary, too, how the withdrawal suddenly of
    bright sunlight took everything out of the landscape that made
    for cheerfulness; and since this particular landscape had
    already managed to convey the suggestion of something sinister,
    the change of course was all the more unwelcome and noticeable.
    For me, I know, the darkening outlook became distinctly more
    alarming, and I found myself more than once calculating how
    soon after sunset the full moon would get up in the east, and
    whether the gathering clouds would greatly interfere with her
    lighting of the little island.
With this general hush of the wind—though it still
    indulged in occasional brief gusts—the river seemed to me
    to grow blacker, the willows to stand more densely together.
    The latter, too, kept up a sort of independent movement of
    their own, rustling among themselves when no wind stirred, and
    shaking oddly from the roots upwards. When common objects in
    this way become charged with the suggestion of horror, they
    stimulate the imagination far more than things of unusual
    appearance; and these bushes, crowding huddled about us,
    assumed for me in the darkness a bizarre grotesquerie
    of appearance that lent to them somehow the aspect of
    purposeful and living creatures. Their very ordinariness, I
    felt, masked what was malignant and hostile to us. The forces
    of the region drew nearer with the coming of night. They were
    focusing upon our island, and more particularly upon ourselves.
    For thus, somehow, in the terms of the imagination, did my
    really indescribable sensations in this extraordinary place
    present themselves.
I had slept a good deal in the early afternoon, and had thus
    recovered somewhat from the exhaustion of a disturbed night,
    but this only served apparently to render me more susceptible
    than before to the obsessing spell of the haunting. I fought
    against it, laughing at my feelings as absurd and childish,
    with very obvious physiological explanations, yet, in spite of
    every effort, they gained in strength upon me so that I dreaded
    the night as a child lost in a forest must dread the approach
    of darkness.
The canoe we had carefully covered with a waterproof sheet
    during the day, and the one remaining paddle had been securely
    tied by the Swede to the base of a tree, lest the wind should
    rob us of that too. From five o'clock onwards I busied myself
    with the stew-pot and preparations for dinner, it being my turn
    to cook that night. We had potatoes, onions, bits of bacon fat
    to add flavour, and a general thick residue from former stews
    at the bottom of the pot; with black bread broken up into it
    the result was most excellent, and it was followed by a stew of
    plums with sugar and a brew of strong tea with dried milk. A
    good pile of wood lay close at hand, and the absence of wind
    made my duties easy. My companion sat lazily watching me,
    dividing his attentions between cleaning his pipe and giving
    useless advice—an admitted privilege of the off-duty man.
    He had been very quiet all the afternoon, engaged in
    re-caulking the canoe, strengthening the tent ropes, and
    fishing for driftwood while I slept. No more talk about
    undesirable things had passed between us, and I think his only
    remarks had to do with the gradual destruction of the island,
    which he declared was now fully a third smaller than when we
    first landed.
The pot had just begun to bubble when I heard his voice
    calling to me from the bank, where he had wandered away without
    my noticing. I ran up.
"Come and listen," he said, "and see what you make of it."
    He held his hand cupwise to his ear, as so often before.
"Now do you hear anything?" he asked, watching me
    curiously.
We stood there, listening attentively together. At first I
    heard only the deep note of the water and the hissings rising
    from its turbulent surface. The willows, for once, were
    motionless and silent. Then a sound began to reach my ears
    faintly, a peculiar sound—something like the humming of a
    distant gong. It seemed to come across to us in the darkness
    from the waste of swamps and willows opposite. It was repeated
    at regular intervals, but it was certainly neither the sound of
    a bell nor the hooting of a distant steamer. I can liken it to
    nothing so much as to the sound of an immense gong, suspended
    far up in the sky, repeating incessantly its muffled metallic
    note, soft and musical, as it was repeatedly struck. My heart
    quickened as I listened.
"I've heard it all day," said my companion. "While you slept
    this afternoon it came all round the island. I hunted it down,
    but could never get near enough to see—to localize it
    correctly. Sometimes it was overhead, and sometimes it seemed
    under the water. Once or twice, too, I could have sworn it was
    not outside at all, but within myself—you
    know—the way a sound in the fourth dimension is supposed
    to come."
I was too much puzzled to pay much attention to his words. I
    listened carefully, striving to associate it with any known
    familiar sound I could think of, but without success. It
    changed in direction, too, coming nearer, and then sinking
    utterly away into remote distance. I cannot say that it was
    ominous in quality, because to me it seemed distinctly musical,
    yet I must admit it set going a distressing feeling that made
    me wish I had never heard it.
"The wind blowing in those sand-funnels," I said, determined
    to find an explanation, "or the bushes rubbing together after
    the storm perhaps."
"It comes off the whole swamp," my friend answered. "It
    comes from everywhere at once." He ignored my explanations. "It
    comes from the willow bushes somehow——"
"But now the wind has dropped," I objected "The willows can
    hardly make a noise by themselves, can they?"
His answer frightened me, first because I had dreaded it,
    and secondly, because I knew intuitively it was true.
"It is because the wind has dropped we now hear it.
    It was drowned before. It is the cry, I believe of
    the——"
I dashed back to my fire, warned by a sound of bubbling that
    the stew was in danger, but determined at the same time to
    escape from further conversation. I was resolute, if possible,
    to avoid the exchanging of views. I dreaded, too, that he would
    begin again about the gods, or the elemental forces, or
    something else disquieting, and I wanted to keep myself well in
    hand for what might happen later. There was another night to be
    faced before we escaped from this distressing place, and there
    was no knowing yet what it might bring forth.
"Come and cut up bread for the pot," I called to him,
    vigorously stirring the appetizing mixture. That stew-pot held
    sanity for us both, and the thought made me laugh.
He came over slowly and took the provision sack from the
    tree, fumbling in its mysterious depths, and then emptying the
    entire contents upon the ground-sheet at his feet.
"Hurry up!" I cried; "it's boiling."
The Swede burst out into a roar of laughter that startled
    me. It was forced laughter, not artificial exactly, but
    mirthless.
"There's nothing here!" he shouted, holding his sides.
"Bread, I mean."
"It's gone. There is no bread. They've taken it!"
I dropped the long spoon and ran up. Everything the sack had
    contained lay upon the ground-sheet, but there was no loaf.
The whole dead weight of my growing fear fell upon me and
    shook me. Then I burst out laughing too. It was the only thing
    to do: and the sound of my own laughter also made me understand
    his. The strain of psychical pressure caused it—this
    explosion of unnatural laughter in both of us; it was an effort
    of repressed forces to seek relief; it was a temporary safety
    valve. And with both of us it ceased quite suddenly.
"How criminally stupid of me!" I cried, still determined to
    be consistent and find an explanation. "I clean forgot to buy a
    loaf at Pressburg. That chattering woman put everything out of
    my head, and I must have left it lying on the counter
    or——"
"The oatmeal, too, is much less than it was this morning,"
    the Swede interrupted.
Why in the world need he draw attention to it? I thought
    angrily.
"There's enough for to-morrow," I said, stirring vigorously,
    "and we can get lots more at Komorn or Gran. In twenty-four
    hours we shall be miles from here."
"I hope so—to God," he muttered, putting the things
    back into the sack, "unless we're claimed first as victims for
    the sacrifice," he added with a foolish laugh. He dragged the
    sack into the tent, for safety's sake, I suppose, and I heard
    him mumbling on to himself, but so indistinctly that it seemed
    quite natural for me to ignore his words.
Our meal was beyond question a gloomy one, and we ate it
    almost in silence, avoiding one another's eyes, and keeping the
    fire bright. Then we washed up and prepared for the night, and,
    once smoking, our minds unoccupied with any definite duties,
    the apprehension I had felt all day long became more and more
    acute. It was not then active fear, I think, but the very
    vagueness of its origin distressed me far more than if I had
    been able to ticket and face it squarely. The curious sound I
    have likened to the note of a gong became now almost incessant,
    and filled the stillness of the night with a faint, continuous
    ringing rather than a series of distinct notes. At one time it
    was behind and at another time in front of us. Sometimes I
    fancied it came from the bushes on our left, and then again
    from the clumps on our right. More often it hovered directly
    overhead like the whirring of wings. It was really everywhere
    at once, behind, in front, at our sides and over our heads,
    completely surrounding us. The sound really defies description.
    But nothing within my knowledge is like that ceaseless muffled
    humming rising off the deserted world of swamps and
    willows.
We sat smoking in comparative silence, the strain growing
    every minute greater. The worst feature of the situation seemed
    to me that we did not know what to expect, and could therefore
    make no sort of preparation by way of defense. We could
    anticipate nothing. My explanations made in the sunshine,
    moreover, now came to haunt me with their foolish and wholly
    unsatisfactory nature, and it was more and more clear to me
    that some kind of plain talk with my companion was inevitable,
    whether I liked it or not. After all, we had to spend the night
    together, and to sleep in the same tent side by side. I saw
    that I could not get along much longer without the support of
    his mind, and for that, of course, plain talk was imperative.
    As long as possible, however, I postponed this little climax,
    and tried to ignore or laugh at the occasional sentences he
    flung into the emptiness.
Some of these sentences, moreover, were confoundedly
    disquieting to me, coming as they did to corroborate much that
    I felt myself: corroboration, too—which made it so much
    more convincing—from a totally different point of view.
    He composed such curious sentences, and hurled them at me in
    such an inconsequential sort of way, as though his main line of
    thought was secret to himself, and these fragments were the
    bits he found it impossible to digest. He got rid of them by
    uttering them. Speech relieved him. It was like being sick.
"There are things about us, I'm sure, that make for
    disorder, disintegration, destruction, our
    destruction," he said once, while the fire blazed between us.
    "We've strayed out of a safe line somewhere."
And another time, when the gong sounds had come nearer,
    ringing much louder than before, and directly over our heads,
    he said, as though talking to himself:
"I don't think a phonograph would show any record of that.
    The sound doesn't come to me by the ears at all. The vibrations
    reach me in another manner altogether, and seem to be within
    me, which is precisely how a fourth dimension sound might be
    supposed to make itself heard."
I purposely made no reply to this, but I sat up a little
    closer to the fire and peered about me into the darkness. The
    clouds were massed all over the sky and no trace of moonlight
    came through. Very still, too, everything was, so that the
    river and the frogs had things all their own way.
"It has that about it," he went on, "which is utterly out of
    common experience. It is unknown. Only one thing
    describes it really: it is a non-human sound; I mean a sound
    outside humanity."
Having rid himself of this indigestible morsel, he lay quiet
    for a time; but he had so admirably expressed my own feeling
    that it was a relief to have the thought out, and to have
    confined it by the limitation of words from dangerous wandering
    to and fro in the mind.
The solitude of that Danube camping-place, can I ever forget
    it? The feeling of being utterly alone on an empty planet! My
    thoughts ran incessantly upon cities and the haunts of men. I
    would have given my soul, as the saying is, for the "feel" of
    those Bavarian villages we had passed through by the score; for
    the normal, human commonplaces, peasants drinking beer, tables
    beneath the trees, hot sunshine, and a ruined castle on the
    rocks behind the red-roofed church. Even the tourists would
    have been welcome.
Yet what I felt of dread was no ordinary ghostly fear. It
    was infinitely greater, stranger, and seemed to arise from some
    dim ancestral sense of terror more profoundly disturbing than
    anything I had known or dreamed of. We had "strayed," as the
    Swede put it, into some region or some set of conditions where
    the risks were great, yet unintelligible to us; where the
    frontiers of some unknown world lay close about us. It was a
    spot held by the dwellers in some outer space, a sort of
    peephole whence they could spy upon the earth, themselves
    unseen, a point where the veil between had worn a little thin.
    As the final result of too long a sojourn here, we should be
    carried over the border and deprived of what we called "our
    lives," yet by mental, not physical, processes. In that sense,
    as he said, we should be the victims of our adventure—a
    sacrifice.
It took us in different fashion, each according to the
    measure of his sensitiveness and powers of resistance. I
    translated it vaguely into a personification of the mightily
    disturbed elements, investing them with the horror of a
    deliberate and malefic purpose, resentful of our audacious
    intrusion into their breeding-place; whereas my friend threw it
    into the unoriginal form at first of a trespass on some ancient
    shrine, some place where the old gods still held sway, where
    the emotional forces of former worshipers still clung, and the
    ancestral portion of him yielded to the old pagan spell.
At any rate, here was a place unpolluted by men, kept clean
    by the winds from coarsening human influences, a place where
    spiritual agencies were within reach and aggressive. Never,
    before or since, have I been so attacked by indescribable
    suggestions of a "beyond region," of another scheme of life,
    another evolution not parallel to the human. And in the end our
    minds would succumb under the weight of the awful spell, and we
    should be drawn across the frontier into their
    world.
Small things testified to this amazing influence of the
    place, and now in the silence round the fire they allowed
    themselves to be noted by the mind. The very atmosphere had
    proved itself a magnifying medium to distort every indication:
    the otter rolling in the current, the hurrying boatman making
    signs, the shifting willows, one and all had been robbed of its
    natural character, and revealed in something of its other
    aspect—as it existed across the border in that other
    region. And this changed aspect I felt was new not merely to
    me, but to the race. The whole experience whose verge we
    touched was unknown to humanity at all. It was a new order of
    experience, and in the true sense of the word
    unearthly.
"It's the deliberate, calculating purpose that reduces
    one's courage to zero," the Swede said suddenly, as if he had
    been actually following my thoughts. "Otherwise imagination
    might count for much. But the paddle, the canoe, the lessening
    food——"
"Haven't I explained all that once?" I interrupted
    viciously.
"You have," he answered dryly; "you have indeed."
He made other remarks too, as usual, about what he called
    the "plain determination to provide a victim"; but, having now
    arranged my thoughts better, I recognized that this was simply
    the cry of his frightened soul against the knowledge that he
    was being attacked in a vital part, and that he would be
    somehow taken or destroyed. The situation called for a courage
    and calmness of reasoning that neither of us could compass, and
    I have never before been so clearly conscious of two persons in
    me—the one that explained everything, and the other that
    laughed at such foolish explanations, yet was horribly
    afraid.
Meanwhile, in the pitchy night the fire died down and the
    woodpile grew small. Neither of us moved to replenish the
    stock, and the darkness consequently came up very close to our
    faces. A few feet beyond the circle of firelight it was inky
    black. Occasionally a stray puff of wind set the billows
    shivering about us, but apart from this not very welcome sound
    a deep and depressing silence reigned, broken only by the
    gurgling of the river and the humming in the air overhead.
We both missed, I think, the shouting company of the
    winds.
At length, at a moment when a stray puff prolonged itself as
    though the wind were about to rise again, I reached the point
    for me of saturation, the point where it was absolutely
    necessary to find relief in plain speech, or else to betray
    myself by some hysterical extravagance that must have been far
    worse in its effect upon both of us. I kicked the fire into a
    blaze, and turned to my companion abruptly. He looked up with a
    start.
"I can't disguise it any longer," I said; "I don't like this
    place, and the darkness, and the noises, and the awful feelings
    I get. There's something here that beats me utterly. I'm in a
    blue funk, and that's the plain truth. If the other shore
    was—different, I swear I'd be inclined to swim for
    it!"
The Swede's face turned very white beneath the deep tan of
    sun and wind. He stared straight at me and answered quietly,
    but his voice betrayed his huge excitement by its unnatural
    calmness. For the moment, at any rate, he was the strong man of
    the two. He was more phlegmatic, for one thing.
"It's not a physical condition we can escape from by running
    away," he replied, in the tone of a doctor diagnosing some
    grave disease; "we must sit tight and wait. There are forces
    close here that could kill a herd of elephants in a second as
    easily as you or I could squash a fly. Our only chance is to
    keep perfectly still. Our insignificance perhaps may save
    us."
I put a dozen questions into my expression of face, but
    found no words. It was precisely like listening to an accurate
    description of a disease whose symptoms had puzzled me.
"I mean that so far, although aware of our disturbing
    presence, they have not found us—not 'located'
    us, as the Americans say," he went on. "They're blundering
    about like men hunting for a leak of gas. The paddle and canoe
    and provisions prove that. I think they feel us, but
    cannot actually see us. We must keep our minds quiet—it's
    our minds they feel. We must control our thoughts, or it's all
    up with us."
"Death you mean?" I stammered, icy with the horror of his
    suggestion.
"Worse—by far," he said. "Death, according to one's
    belief, means either annihilation or release from the
    limitations of the senses, but it involves no change of
    character. You don't suddenly alter just because the
    body's gone. But this means a radical alteration, a complete
    change, a horrible loss of oneself by substitution—far
    worse than death, and not even annihilation. We happen to have
    camped in a spot where their region touches ours where the veil
    between has worn thin"—horrors! he was using my very own
    phrase, my actual words—"so that they are aware of our
    being in their neighborhood."
"But who are aware?" I asked.
I forgot the shaking of the willows in the windless calm,
    the humming overhead, everything except that I was waiting for
    an answer that I dreaded more than I can possibly explain.
He lowered his voice at once to reply, leaning forward a
    little over the fire, an indefinable change in his face that
    made me avoid his eyes and look down upon the ground.
"All my life," he said, "I have been strangely, vividly
    conscious of another region—not far removed from our own
    world in one sense, yet wholly different in kind—where
    great things go on unceasingly, where immense and terrible
    personalities hurry by, intent on vast purposes compared to
    which earthly affairs, the rise and fall of nations, the
    destinies of empires, the fate of armies and continents, are
    all as dust in the balance; vast purposes, I mean, that deal
    directly with the soul, and not indirectly with mere
    expressions of the soul—"
"I suggest just now—" I began, seeking to stop him,
    feeling as though I was face to face with a madman. But he
    instantly overbore me with his torrent that had to
    come.
"You think," he said, "it is the spirits of the elements,
    and I thought perhaps it was the old gods. But I tell you now
    it is—neither. These would be comprehensible
    entities, for they have relations with men, depending upon them
    for worship or sacrifice, whereas these beings who are now
    about us have absolutely nothing to do with mankind, and it is
    mere chance that their space happens just at this spot to touch
    our own."
The mere conception, which his words somehow made so
    convincing, as I listened to them there in the dark stillness
    of that lonely island, set me shaking a little all over. I
    found it impossible to control my movements.
"And what do you propose?" I began again.
"A sacrifice, a victim, might save us by distracting them
    until we could get away," he went on, "just as the wolves stop
    to devour the dogs and give the sleigh another start.
    But—I see no chance of any other victim now."
I stared blankly at him. The gleam in his eyes was dreadful.
    Presently he continued.
"It's the willows, of course. The willows mask the
    others, but the others are feeling about for us. If we let our
    minds betray our fear, we're lost, lost utterly." He looked at
    me with an expression so calm, so determined, so sincere, that
    I no longer had any doubts as to his sanity. He was as sane as
    any man ever was. "If we can hold out through the night," he
    added, "we may get off in the daylight unnoticed, or rather,
    undiscovered."
"But you really think a sacrifice would——"
That gong-like humming came down very close over our heads
    as I spoke, but it was my friend's scared face that really
    stopped my mouth.
"Hush!" he whispered, holding up his hand. "Do not mention
    them more than you can help. Do not refer to them by
    name. To name is to reveal: it is the inevitable clue, and
    our only hope lies in ignoring them, in order that they may
    ignore us."
"Even in thought?" He was extraordinarily agitated.
"Especially in thought. Our thoughts make spirals in their
    world. We must keep them out of our minds at all costs
    if possible."
I raked the fire together to prevent the darkness having
    everything its own way. I never longed for the sun as I longed
    for it then in the awful blackness of that summer night.
"Were you awake all last night?" he went on suddenly.
"I slept badly a little after dawn," I replied evasively,
    trying to follow his instructions, which I knew instinctively
    were true, "but the wind, of course—"
"I know. But the wind won't account for all the noises."
"Then you heard it too?"
"The multiplying countless little footsteps I heard," he
    said, adding, after a moment's hesitation, "and that other
    sound—"
"You mean above the tent, and the pressing down upon us of
    something tremendous, gigantic?"
He nodded significantly.
"It was like the beginning of a sort of inner suffocation?"
    I said.
"Partly, yes. It seemed to me that the weight of the
    atmosphere had been altered—had increased enormously, so
    that we should be crushed."
"And that," I went on, determined to have it all
    out, pointing upwards where the gong-like note hummed
    ceaselessly, rising and falling like wind. "What do you make of
    that?"
"It's their sound," he whispered gravely. "It's the
    sound of their world, the humming in their region. The division
    here is so thin that it leaks through somehow. But, if you
    listen carefully, you'll find it's not above so much as around
    us. It's in the willows. It's the willows themselves humming,
    because here the willows have been made symbols of the forces
    that are against us."
I could not follow exactly what he meant by this, yet the
    thought and idea in my mind were beyond question the thought
    and idea in his. I realized what he realized, only with less
    power of analysis than his. It was on the tip of my tongue to
    tell him at last about my hallucination of the ascending
    figures and the moving bushes, when he suddenly thrust his face
    again close into mine across the firelight and began to speak
    in a very earnest whisper. He amazed me by his calmness and
    pluck, his apparent control of the situation. This man I had
    for years deemed unimaginative, stolid!
"Now listen," he said. "The only thing for us to do is to go
    on as though nothing had happened, follow our usual habits, go
    to bed, and so forth; pretend we feel nothing and notice
    nothing. It is a question wholly of the mind, and the less we
    think about them the better our chance of escape. Above all,
    don't think, for what you think happens!"
"All right," I managed to reply, simply breathless with his
    words and the strangeness of it all; "all right, I'll try, but
    tell me one thing more first. Tell me what you make of those
    hollows in the ground all about us, those sand-funnels?"
"No!" he cried, forgetting to whisper in his excitement. "I
    dare not, simply dare not, put the thought into words. If you
    have not guessed I am glad. Don't try to. They have
    put it into my mind; try your hardest to prevent their putting
    it into yours."
He sank his voice again to a whisper before he finished, and
    I did not press him to explain. There was already just about as
    much horror in me as I could hold. The conversation came to an
    end, and we smoked our pipes busily in silence.
Then something happened, something unimportant apparently,
    as the way is when the nerves are in a very great state of
    tension, and this small thing for a brief space gave me an
    entirely different point of view. I chanced to look down at my
    sand-shoe—the sort we used for the canoe—and
    something to do with the hole at the toe suddenly recalled to
    me the London shop where I had bought them, the difficulty the
    man had in fitting me, and other details of the uninteresting
    but practical operation. At once, in its train, followed a
    wholesome view of the modern skeptical world I was accustomed
    to move in at home. I thought of roast beef and ale,
    motor-cars, policemen, brass bands, and a dozen other things
    that proclaimed the soul of ordinariness or utility. The effect
    was immediate and astonishing even to myself. Psychologically,
    I suppose, it was simply a sudden and violent reaction after
    the strain of living in an atmosphere of things that to the
    normal consciousness must seem impossible and incredible. But,
    whatever the cause, it momentarily lifted the spell from my
    heart, and left me for the short space of a minute feeling free
    and utterly unafraid. I looked up at my friend opposite.
"You damned old pagan!" I cried, laughing aloud in his face.
    "You imaginative idiot! You superstitious idolator!
    You——"
I stopped in the middle, seized anew by the old horror. I
    tried to smother the sound of my voice as something
    sacrilegious. The Swede, of course, heard it too—that
    strange cry overhead in the darkness—and that sudden drop
    in the air as though something had come nearer.
He had turned ashen white under the tan. He stood bolt
    upright in front of the fire, stiff as a rod, staring at
    me.
"After that," he said in a sort of helpless, frantic way,
    "we must go! We can't stay now; we must strike camp this very
    instant and go on—down the river."
He was talking, I saw, quite wildly, his words dictated by
    abject terror—the terror he had resisted so long, but
    which had caught him at last.
"In the dark?" I exclaimed, shaking with fear after my
    hysterical outburst, but still realizing our position better
    than he did. "Sheer madness! The river's in flood, and we've
    only got a single paddle. Besides, we only go deeper into their
    country! There's nothing ahead for fifty miles but willows,
    willows, willows!"
He sat down again in a state of semi-collapse. The
    positions, by one of those kaleidoscopic changes nature loves,
    were suddenly reversed, and the control of our forces passed
    over into my hands. His mind at last had reached the point
    where it was beginning to weaken.
"What on earth possessed you to do such a thing?" he
    whispered, with the awe of genuine terror in his voice and
    face.
I crossed round to his side of the fire. I took both his
    hands in mine, kneeling down beside him and looking straight
    into his frightened eyes.
"We'll make one more blaze," I said firmly, "and then turn
    in for the night. At sunrise we'll be off full speed for
    Komorn. Now, pull yourself together a bit, and remember your
    own advice about not thinking fear!"
He said no more, and I saw that he would agree and obey. In
    some measure, too, it was a sort of relief to get up and make
    an excursion into the darkness for more wood. We kept close
    together, almost touching, groping among the bushes and along
    the bank. The humming overhead never ceased, but seemed to me
    to grow louder as we increased our distance from the fire. It
    was shivery work!
We were grubbing away in the middle of a thickish clump of
    willows where some driftwood from a former flood had caught
    high among the branches, when my body was seized in a grip that
    made me half drop upon the sand. It was the Swede. He had
    fallen against me, and was clutching me for support. I heard
    his breath coming and going in short gasps.
"Look! By my soul!" he whispered, and for the first time in
    my experience I knew what it was to hear tears of terror in a
    human voice. He was pointing to the fire, some fifty feet away.
    I followed the direction of his finger, and I swear my heart
    missed a beat.
There, in front of the dim glow, something was
    moving.
I saw it through a veil that hung before my eyes like the
    gauze drop-curtain used at the back of a theater—hazily a
    little. It was neither a human figure nor an animal. To me it
    gave the strange impression of being as large as several
    animals grouped together, like horses, two or three, moving
    slowly. The Swede, too, got a similar result, though expressing
    it differently, for he thought it was shaped and sized like a
    clump of willow bushes, rounded at the top, and moving all over
    upon its surface—"coiling upon itself like smoke," he
    said afterwards.
"I watched it settle downwards through the bushes," he
    sobbed at me. "Look, by God! It's coming this way! Oh,
    oh!"—he gave a kind of whistling cry. "They've found
    us."
I gave one terrified glance, which just enabled me to see
    that the shadowy form was swinging towards us through the
    bushes, and then I collapsed backwards with a crash into the
    branches. These failed, of course, to support my weight, so
    that with the Swede on the top of me we fell in a struggling
    heap upon the sand. I really hardly knew what was happening. I
    was conscious only of a sort of enveloping sensation of icy
    fear that plucked the nerves out of their fleshly covering,
    twisted them this way and that, and replaced them quivering. My
    eyes were tightly shut; something in my throat choked me; a
    feeling that my consciousness was expanding, extending out into
    space, swiftly gave way to another feeling that I was losing it
    altogether, and about to die.
An acute spasm of pain passed through me, and I was aware
    that the Swede had hold of me in such a way that he hurt me
    abominably. It was the way he caught at me in falling.
But it was this pain, he declared afterwards, that saved me:
    it caused me to forget them and think of something
    else at the very instant when they were about to find me. It
    concealed my mind from them at the moment of discovery, yet
    just in time to evade their terrible seizing of me. He himself,
    he says, actually swooned at the same moment, and that was what
    saved him.
I only know that at a later time, how long or short is
    impossible to say, I found myself scrambling up out of the
    slippery network of willow branches, and saw my companion
    standing in front of me holding out a hand to assist me. I
    stared at him in a dazed way, rubbing the arm he had twisted
    for me. Nothing came to me to say, somehow.
"I lost consciousness for a moment or two," I heard him say.
    "That's what saved me. It made me stop thinking about
    them."
"You nearly broke my arm in two," I said, uttering my only
    connected thought at the moment. A numbness came over me.
"That's what saved you!" he replied. "Between us,
    we've managed to set them off on a false tack somewhere. The
    humming has ceased. It's gone—for the moment at any
    rate!"
A wave of hysterical laughter seized me again, and this time
    spread to my friend too—great healing gusts of shaking
    laughter that brought a tremendous sense of relief in their
    train. We made our way back to the fire and put the wood on so
    that it blazed at once. Then we saw that the tent had fallen
    over and lay in a tangled heap upon the ground.
We picked it up, and during the process tripped more than
    once and caught our feet in sand.
"It's those sand-funnels," exclaimed the Swede, when the
    tent was up again and the firelight lit up the ground for
    several yards about us. "And look at the size of them!"
All round the tent and about the fireplace where we had seen
    the moving shadows there were deep funnel-shaped hollows in the
    sand, exactly similar to the ones we had already found over the
    island, only far bigger and deeper, beautifully formed, and
    wide enough in some instances to admit the whole of my foot and
    leg.
Neither of us said a word. We both knew that sleep was the
    safest thing we could do, and to bed we went accordingly
    without further delay, having first thrown sand on the fire and
    taken the provision sack and the paddle inside the tent with
    us. The canoe, too, we propped in such a way at the end of the
    tent that our feet touched it, and the least motion would
    disturb and wake us.
In case of emergency, too, we again went to bed in our
    clothes, ready for a sudden start.
V
It was my firm intention to lie awake all night and watch,
    but the exhaustion of nerves and body decreed otherwise, and
    sleep after a while came over me with a welcome blanket of
    oblivion. The fact that my companion also slept quickened its
    approach. At first he fidgeted and constantly sat up, asking me
    if I "heard this" or "heard that." He tossed about on his cork
    mattress, and said the tent was moving and the river had risen
    over the point of the island; but each time I went out to look
    I returned with the report that all was well, and finally he
    grew calmer and lay still. Then at length his breathing became
    regular and I heard unmistakable sounds of snoring—the
    first and only time in my life when snoring has been a welcome
    and calming influence.
This, I remember, was the last thought in my mind before
    dozing off.
A difficulty in breathing woke me, and I found the blanket
    over my face. But something else besides the blanket was
    pressing upon me, and my first thought was that my companion
    had rolled off his mattress on to my own in his sleep. I called
    to him and sat up, and at the same moment it came to me that
    the tent was surrounded. That sound of multitudinous
    soft pattering was again audible outside, filling the night
    with horror.
I called again to him, louder than before. He did not
    answer, but I missed the sound of his snoring, and also noticed
    that the flap of the tent door was down. This was the
    unpardonable sin. I crawled out in the darkness to hook it back
    securely, and it was then for the first time I realized
    positively that the Swede was not there. He had gone.
I dashed out in a mad run, seized by a dreadful agitation,
    and the moment I was out I plunged into a sort of torrent of
    humming that surrounded me completely and came out of every
    quarter of the heavens at once. It was that same familiar
    humming—gone mad! A swarm of great invisible bees might
    have been about me in the air. The sound seemed to thicken the
    very atmosphere, and I felt that my lungs worked with
    difficulty.
But my friend was in danger, and I could not hesitate.
The dawn was just about to break, and a faint whitish light
    spread upwards over the clouds from a thin strip of clear
    horizon. No wind stirred. I could just make out the bushes and
    river beyond, and the pale sandy patches. In my excitement I
    ran frantically to and fro about the island, calling him by
    name, shouting at the top of my voice the first words that came
    into my head. But the willows smothered my voice, and the
    humming muffled it, so that the sound only traveled a few feet
    round me. I plunged among the bushes, tripping headlong,
    tumbling over roots, and scraping my face as I tore this way
    and that among the preventing branches.
Then, quite unexpectedly, I came out upon the island's point
    and saw a dark figure outlined between the water and the sky.
    It was the Swede. And already he had one foot in the river! A
    moment more and he would have taken the plunge.
I threw myself upon him, flinging my arms about his waist
    and dragging him shorewards with all my strength. Of course he
    struggled furiously, making a noise all the time just like that
    cursed humming, and using the most outlandish phrases in his
    anger about "going inside to Them," and "taking the
    way of the water and the wind," and God only knows what more
    besides, that I tried in vain to recall afterwards, but which
    turned me sick with horror and amazement as I listened. But in
    the end I managed to get him into the comparative safety of the
    tent, and flung him breathless and cursing upon the mattress,
    where I held him until the fit had passed.
I think the suddenness with which it all went and he grew
    calm, coinciding as it did with the equally abrupt cessation of
    the humming and pattering outside—I think this was almost
    the strangest part of the whole business perhaps. For he just
    opened his eyes and turned his tired face up to me so that the
    dawn threw a pale light upon it through the doorway, and said,
    for all the world just like a frightened child:
"My life, old man—it's my life I owe you. But it's all
    over now anyhow. They've found a victim in our place!"
Then he dropped back upon his blankets and went to sleep
    literally under my eyes. He simply collapsed, and began to
    snore again as healthily as though nothing had happened and he
    had never tried to offer his own life as a sacrifice by
    drowning. And when the sunlight woke him three hours
    later—hours of ceaseless vigil for me—it became so
    clear to me that he remembered absolutely nothing of what he
    had attempted to do, that I deemed it wise to hold my peace and
    ask no dangerous questions.
He woke naturally and easily, as I have said, when the sun
    was already high in a windless hot sky, and he at once got up
    and set about the preparation of the fire for breakfast. I
    followed him anxiously at bathing, but he did not attempt to
    plunge in, merely dipping his head and making some remark about
    the extra coldness of the water.
"River's falling at last," he said, "and I'm glad of
    it."
"The humming has stopped too," I said.
He looked up at me quietly with his normal expression.
    Evidently he remembered everything except his own attempt at
    suicide.
"Everything has stopped," he said,
    "because——"
He hesitated. But I knew some reference to that remark he
    had made just before he fainted was in his mind, and I was
    determined to know it.
"Because 'They've found another victim'?" I said, forcing a
    little laugh.
"Exactly," he answered, "exactly! I feel as positive of it
    as though—as though—I feel quite safe again, I
    mean," he finished.
He began to look curiously about him. The sunlight lay in
    hot patches on the sand. There was no wind. The willows were
    motionless. He slowly rose to feet.
"Come," he said; "I think if we look, we shall find it."
He started off on a run, and I followed him. He kept to the
    banks, poking with a stick among the sandy bays and caves and
    little back-waters, myself always close on his heels.
"Ah!" he exclaimed presently, "ah!"
The tone of his voice somehow brought back to me a vivid
    sense of the horror of the last twenty-four hours, and I
    hurried up to join him. He was pointing with his stick at a
    large black object that lay half in the water and half on the
    sand. It appeared to be caught by some twisted willow roots so
    that the river could not sweep it away. A few hours before the
    spot must have been under water.
"See," he said quietly, "the victim that made our escape
    possible!"
And when I peered across his shoulder I saw that his stick
    rested on the body of a man. He turned it over. It was the
    corpse of a peasant, and the face was hidden in the sand.
    Clearly the man had been drowned but a few hours before, and
    his body must have been swept down upon our island somewhere
    about the hour of the dawn—at the very time the fit
    had passed.
"We must give it a decent burial, you know."
"I suppose so," I replied. I shuddered a little in spite of
    myself, for there was something about the appearance of that
    poor drowned man that turned me cold.
The Swede glanced up sharply at me, and began clambering
    down the bank. I followed him more leisurely. The current, I
    noticed, had torn away much of the clothing from the body, so
    that the neck and part of the chest lay bare.
Halfway down the bank my companion suddenly stopped and held
    up his hand in warning; but either my foot slipped, or I had
    gained too much momentum to bring myself quickly to a halt, for
    I bumped into him and sent him forward with a sort of leap to
    save himself. We tumbled together on to the hard sand so that
    our feet splashed into the water. And, before anything could be
    done, we had collided a little heavily against the corpse.
The Swede uttered a sharp cry. And I sprang back as if I had
    been shot.
At the moment we touched the body there arose from its
    surface the loud sound of humming—the sound of several
    hummings—which passed with a vast commotion as of winged
    things in the air about us and disappeared upwards into the
    sky, growing fainter and fainter till they finally ceased in
    the distance. It was exactly as though we had disturbed some
    living yet invisible creatures at work.
My companion clutched me, and I think I clutched him, but
    before either of us had time properly to recover from the
    unexpected shock, we saw that a movement of the current was
    turning the corpse round so that it became released from the
    grip of the willow roots. A moment later it had turned
    completely over, the dead face uppermost, staring at the sky.
    It lay on the edge of the main stream. In another moment it
    would be swept away.
The Swede started to save it, shouting again something I did
    not catch about a "proper burial" and then abruptly dropped
    upon his knees on the sand and covered his eyes with his hands.
    I was beside him in an instant.
I saw what he had seen.
For just as the body swung round to the current the face and
    the exposed chest turned full towards us, and showed plainly
    how the skin and flesh were indented with small hollows,
    beautifully formed, and exactly similar in shape and kind to
    the sand-funnels that we had found all over the island.
"Their mark!" I heard my companion mutter under his breath.
    "Their awful mark!"
And when I turned my eyes again from his ghastly face to the
    river, the current had done its work, and the body had been
    swept away into midstream and was already beyond our reach and
    almost out of sight, turning over and over on the waves like an
    otter.
