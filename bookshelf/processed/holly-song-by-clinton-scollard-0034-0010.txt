HOLLY SONG

 BY CLINTON SCOLLARD

  Care is but a broken bubble, 

 Trill the carol, troll the catch; 

 Sooth, we'll cry, "A truce to trouble!" 

 Mirth and mistletoe shall match. 



 Happy folly! we'll be jolly! 

 Who'd be melancholy now? 

 With a "Hey, the holly! Ho, the holly!" 

 Polly hangs the holly bough. 



 Laughter lurking in the eye, sir, 

 Pleasure foots it frisk and free. 

 He who frowns or looks awry, sir, 

 Faith, a witless wight is he! 



 Merry folly! what a volley 

 Greets the hanging of the bough! 

 With a "Hey, the holly! Ho, the holly!" 

 Who'd be melancholy now?
