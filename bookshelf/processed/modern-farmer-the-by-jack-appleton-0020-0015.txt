THE MODERN FARMER  BY JACK APPLETON

  Observe the modern farmer! In the shade 

 He works his crops by letters-patent now: 

 Steam drives the reaper (which is union-made), 

 As in the spring it pushed the auto-plough; 

 A patent milker manages each cow; 

 Electric currents guide the garden spade, 

 And cattle, poultry, pigs through "process" wade 

 To quick perfectionâ€”Science shows them how. 

 But while machinery plants and reaps, he rests 

 Upon his porch, and listens to the quail 

 That pipe far off in yonder hand-made vale, 

 With muscles flabby and with strength gone stale, 

 Until, in desperation, he invests 

 In "Muscle-Building Motions Taught by Mail"!
