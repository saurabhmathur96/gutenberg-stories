OMAR IN THE KLONDYKE

 BY HOWARD V. SUTHERLAND

  "This Omar seems a decent chap," said Flapjack Dick one night, 

 When he had read my copy through and then blown out the light. 

 "I ain't much stuck on poetry, because I runs to news, 

 But I appreciates a man that loves his glass of booze. 



 "And Omar here likes a good red wine, although he's pretty mum; 

 On liquors, which is better yet, like whisky, gin, or rum; 

 Perhaps his missus won't allow him things like that to touch, 

 And he doesn't like to own it. Well, I don't blame Omar much. 



 "Then I likes a man what's partial to the ladies, young or old, 

 And Omar seems to seek 'em much as me and you seek gold; 

 I only hope for his sake that his wife don't learn his game 

 Or she'll put a chain on Omar, and that would be a shame.





 "His language is some florid, but I guess it is the style 

 Of them writer chaps that studies and burns the midnight ile; 

 He tells us he's no chicken; so I guess he knows what's best, 

 And can hold his own with Shakespeare, Waukeen Miller, and the rest. 



 "But I hope he ain't a thinkin' of a trip to this yere camp, 

 For our dancin' girls is ancient, and our liquor's somewhat damp 

 By doctorin' with water, and we ain't got wine at all, 

 Though I had a drop of porter—but that was back last fall. 



 "And he mightn't like our manners, and he mightn't like the smell 

 Which is half the charm of Dawson; and he mightn't live to tell 

 Of the acres of wild roses that grows on every street; 

 And he mightn't like the winter, or he mightn't like the heat. 



 "So I guess it's best for Omar for to stay right where he is, 

 And gallivant with Tottie, or with Flossie, or with Liz; 

 And fill himself with claret, and, although it ain't like beer, 

 I wish he'd send a bottle—just one bottle—to us here."
