THE RUNAWAY BOY

 By James Whitcomb Riley

  Wunst I sassed my Pa, an' he 

 Won't stand that, an' punished me,— 

 Nen when he was gone that day, 

 I slipped out an' runned away. 



 I tooked all my copper-cents, 

 An' clumbed over our back fence 

 In the jimpson-weeds 'at growed 

 Ever'where all down the road. 



 Nen I got out there, an' nen 

 I runned some—an' runned again 

 When I met a man 'at led 

 A big cow 'at shooked her head. 



 I went down a long, long lane 

 Where was little pigs a-play'n'; 

 An' a grea'-big pig went "Booh!" 

 An' jumped up, an' skeered me too. 



 Nen I scampered past, an' they 

 Was somebody hollered "Hey!" 

 An' I ist looked ever'where, 

 An' they was nobody there. 



 I want to, but I'm 'fraid to try 

 To go back.... An' by-an'-by 

 Somepin' hurts my throat inside— 

 An' I want my Ma—an' cried.





 Nen a grea'-big girl come through 

 Where's a gate, an' telled me who 

 Am I? an' ef I tell where 

 My home's at she'll show me there. 



 But I couldn't ist but tell 

 What's my name ; an' she says well, 

 An' she tooked me up an' says 

 She know where I live, she guess. 



 Nen she telled me hug wite close 

 Round her neck!—an' off she goes 

 Skippin' up the street! An' nen 

 Purty soon I'm home again. 



 An' my Ma, when she kissed me, 

 Kissed the big girl too, an' she 

 Kissed me—ef I p'omise shore 

 I won't run away no more!
