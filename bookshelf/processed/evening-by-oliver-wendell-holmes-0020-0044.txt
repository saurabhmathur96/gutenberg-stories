EVENING

 By A Tailor  BY OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES

  Day hath put on his jacket, and around 

 His burning bosom buttoned it with stars. 

 Here will I lay me on the velvet grass, 

 That is like padding to earth's meager ribs, 

 And hold communion with the things about me. 

 Ah me! how lovely is the golden braid 

 That binds the skirt of night's descending robe! 

 The thin leaves, quivering on their silken threads, 

 Do make a music like to rustling satin, 

 As the light breezes smooth their downy nap. 



 Ha! what is this that rises to my touch, 

 So like a cushion? Can it be a cabbage? 

 It is, it is that deeply injured flower, 

 Which boys do flout us with;—but yet I love thee, 

 Thou giant rose, wrapped in a green surtout. 

 Doubtless in Eden thou didst blush as bright 

 As these, thy puny brethren; and thy breath 

 Sweetened the fragrance of her spicy air; 

 But now thou seemest like a bankrupt beau, 

 Stripped of his gaudy hues and essences, 

 And growing portly in his sober garments.





 Is that a swan that rides upon the water? 

 O no, it is that other gentle bird, 

 Which is the patron of our noble calling. 

 I well remember, in my early years, 

 When these young hands first closed upon a goose; 

 I have a scar upon my thimble finger, 

 Which chronicles the hour of young ambition. 

 My father was a tailor, and his father, 

 And my sire's grandsire, all of them were tailors; 

 They had an ancient goose,—it was an heirloom 

 From some remoter tailor of our race. 

 It happened I did see it on a time 

 When none was near, and I did deal with it, 

 And it did burn me,—O, most fearfully! 



 It is a joy to straighten out one's limbs, 

 And leap elastic from the level counter, 

 Leaving the petty grievances of earth, 

 The breaking thread, the din of clashing shears, 

 And all the needles that do wound the spirit, 

 For such a pensive hour of soothing silence. 

 Kind Nature, shuffling in her loose undress, 

 Lays bare her shady bosom;—I can feel 

 With all around me;—I can hail the flowers 

 That sprig earth's mantle,—and yon quiet bird, 

 That rides the stream, is to me as a brother. 

 The vulgar know not all the hidden pockets, 

 Where Nature stows away her loveliness. 

 But this unnatural posture of the legs 

 Cramps my extended calves, and I must go 

 Where I can coil them in their wonted fashion.
