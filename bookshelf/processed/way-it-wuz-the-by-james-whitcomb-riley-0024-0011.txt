THE WAY IT WUZ

 BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY

  Las' July—an', I presume 

 'Bout as hot 

 As the ole Gran'-Jury room 

 Where they sot!— 

 Fight 'twixt Mike an' Dock McGriff— 

 'Pears to me jes' like as if 

 I'd a dremp' the whole blame thing— 

 Allus ha'nts me roun' the gizzard 

 When they're nightmares on the wing, 

 An' a feller's blood 's jes' friz! 

 Seed the row from a to izzard— 

 'Cause I wuz a-standin' as clost to 'em 

 As me an' you is! 



 Tell you the way it wuz— 

 An' I don't want to see, 

 Like some fellers does, 

 When they're goern to be 

 Any kind o' fuss— 

 On'y makes a rumpus wuss 

 Fer to interfere 

 When their dander's riz— 

 But I wuz a-standin' as clost to 'em 

 As me an' you is! 



 I wuz kind o' strayin' 

 Past the blame saloon— 

 Heerd some fiddler playin' 

 That "ole hee-cup tune!"



 Sort o' stopped, you know, 

 Fer a minit er so, 

 And wuz jes' about 

 Settin' down, when— Jeemses whizz ! 

 Whole durn winder-sash fell out! 

 An' there laid Dock McGriff, and Mike 

 A-straddlin' him, all bloody-like, 

 An' both a-gittin' down to biz!— 

 An' I wuz a-standin' as clost to 'em 

 As me an' you is! 



 I wuz the on'y man aroun'— 

 (Durn old-fogy town! 

 'Peared more like, to me, 

 Sund'y 'an Saturd'y! ) 

 Dog come 'crost the road 

 An' tuck a smell 

 An' put right back; 

 Mishler driv by 'ith a load 

 O' cantalo'pes he couldn't sell— 

 Too mad, 'y jack! 

 To even ast 

 What wuz up, as he went past! 

 Weather most outrageous hot!— 

 Fairly hear it sizz 

 Roun' Dock an' Mike—till Dock he shot, 

 An' Mike he slacked that grip o' his 

 An' fell, all spraddled out. Dock riz 

 'Bout half up, a-spittin' red, 

 An' shuck his head— 

 An' I wuz a-standin' as clost to 'em 

 As me an' you is!





 An' Dock he says, 

 A-whisperin'-like,— 

 "It hain't no use 

 A-tryin'!—Mike 

 He's jes' ripped my daylights loose!— 

 Git that blame-don fiddler to 

 Let up, an' come out here—You 

 Got some burryin' to do,— 

 Mike makes one , an' I expects 

 In ten seconds I'll make two !" 

 And he drapped back, where he riz, 

 'Crost Mike's body, black and blue, 

 Like a great big letter X!— 

 An' I wuz a-standin' as clost to 'em 

 As me an' you is!
