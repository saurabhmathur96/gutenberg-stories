THE CO-OPERATIVE HOUSEKEEPERS  By Elliott Flower

  Ten thoughtful women, ever wise, 

 A wondrous scheme did once devise 

 For ease, and to economize. 



 "Coöperation!" was their cry, 

 And not a husband dared deny 

 'Twould life and labor simplify. 



 One gardener, the ten decreed, 

 Was all the neighborhood would need 

 To plant and trim and rake and weed. 



 The money saved they could invest 

 As vagrant fancy might suggest, 

 And each could then be better dressed. 



 So well this worked that, on the whole, 

 It seemed to them extremely droll 

 To pay so much for handling coal. 



 One man all work then undertook, 

 And former methods they forsook, 

 Deciding even on one cook. 



 One dining-room was next in line, 

 Where, free from care, they all could dine 

 At less expense, as you'll divine. 

  "Two maids," they said, "could quickly flit 

 From home to home, so why permit 

 Expense that brings no benefit?" 



 Economy of cash and care 

 Became a hobby of the fair, 

 Until their husbands sought a share. 



 "Although," the latter said, "all goes 

 For luxuries and costly clothes, 

 The method still advantage shows. 



 "While we've not gained, we apprehend 

 Good Fortune will on us attend, 

 If we continue to the end. 



 "If you've succeeded, why should we 

 From constant toil be never free? 

 One income should sufficient be; 



 "And, taking turns in earning that, 

 We'll have the leisure to wax fat 

 And spend much time in idle chat. 



 "So let us see the matter through, 

 And, in this line, it must be true 

 One house for all will surely do. 



 "And if one house means less of strife, 

 To gain the comforts of this life, 

 Why, further progress means one wife."

 Ten women now, their acts attest, 

 Prefer ten homes, and deem it best 

 To let coöperation rest.
