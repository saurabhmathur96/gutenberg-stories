A WINTER FANCY

 ( Little Tommy Loq )

 BY R.K. MUNKITTRICK

  My father piles the snow-drifts 

 Around his rosy face, 

 And covers all his whiskersâ€” 

 The grass that grows apace. 



 And then he runs the snow-plough 

 Across his smiling lawn, 

 And all the snow-drifts vanish 

 And then the grass is gone.
