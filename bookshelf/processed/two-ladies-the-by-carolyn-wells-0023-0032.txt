THE TWO LADIES

 BY CAROLYN WELLS

 Once on a Time there were Two Ladies at a Shop where Gorgeous and
Expensive Silks were temptingly displayed. "Only Six Dollars a Yard,
Madam," said the Shopman to One of the Ladies, as he held up the
Lustrous Breadths in those Tempting Fan-shaped Folds peculiar to
Shopmen.

 The Lady hesitated, and looked Dubiously at the Silk, for she knew it
was Beyond her Means.

 The Shopman Continued: "Very Cheap at the Price, and I have Only this
One Dress Pattern remaining. You will Take it? Yes? Certainly, I will
Send it at Once."

 The Lady went away filled with Deep Regret because she had squandered
her Money so Foolishly, and wished she had been Firm in her Refusal to
buy the Goods.

 The Other Lady saw a similar Silk. She felt it Between her Fingers,
Measured its Width with her Eye, and then said Impulsively, "Oh, That is
just What I Want. I will Take Twenty Yards."

 No Sooner was the Silk cut off than the Lady felt Sharp Twinges of
Remorse, for she knew she must Pay for it with the Money she had Saved
Up for a new Dining-Room Carpet.

 MORALS:

 This Fable teaches that the Woman Who Deliberates Is Lost, and That We
Should Think Twice Before We Speak Once.
