minds, were speedily warped into errors." ...

  WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS

 BY JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL

  Guvener B. is a sensible man; 

 He stays to his home an' looks arter his folks; 

 He draws his furrer ez straight ez he can, 

 An' into nobody's tater-patch pokes; 

 But John P. 

 Robinson he 

 Sez he wunt vote fer Guvener B. 



 My! ain't it terrible? Wut shall we du? 

 We can't never choose him, o' course,—thet's flat; 

 Guess we shall hev to come round (don't you?) 

 An' go in fer thunder an' guns, an' all that; 

 Fer John P. 

 Robinson he 

 Sez he wunt vote fer Guvener B. 



 Gineral C. is a dreffle smart man: 

 He's ben on all sides thet give places or pelf; 

 But consistency still was a part of his plan,— 

 He's ben true to one party,—an' thet is himself;— 

 So John P. 

 Robinson he 

 Sez he shall vote fer Gineral C.





 Gineral C. he goes in fer the war; 

 He don't vally principle more'n an old cud; 

 Wut did God make us raytional creeturs fer, 

 But glory an' gunpowder, plunder an' blood? 

 So John P. 

 Robinson he 

 Sez he shall vote for Gineral C. 



 We were gettin' on nicely up here to our village, 

 With good old idees o' wut's right an' wut ain't, 

 We kind o' thought Christ went agin war an' pillage, 

 An' thet eppyletts worn't the best mark of a saint; 

 But John P. 

 Robinson he 

 Sez this kind o' thing's an exploded idee. 



 The side of our country must ollers be took, 

 An' Presidunt Polk, you know, he is our country, 

 An' the angel thet writes all our sins in a book 

 Puts the debit to him, an' to us the per contry ; 

 An' John P. 

 Robinson he 

 Sez this is his view o' the thing to a T. 



 Parson Wilbur he calls all these argimunts lies; 

 Sez they're nothin' on airth but jest fee, faw, fum ; 

 An' thet all this big talk of our destinies 

 Is half on it ign'ance, an' t'other half rum; 

 But John P. 

 Robinson he 

 Sez it ain't no sech thing; an', of course, so must we.





 Parson Wilbur sez he never heerd in his life 

 Thet th' Apostles rigged out in their swaller-tail coats, 

 An' marched round in front of a drum an' a fife, 

 To git some on 'em office, an' some on 'em votes; 

 But John P. 

 Robinson he 

 Sez they didn't know everythin' down in Judee. 



 Wall, it's a marcy we've gut folks to tell us 

 The rights an' the wrongs o' these matters, I vow,— 

 God sends country lawyers, an' other wise fellers, 

 To start the world's team wen it gits in a slough; 

 Fer John P. 

 Robinson he 

 Sez the world'll go right, ef he hollers out Gee!
