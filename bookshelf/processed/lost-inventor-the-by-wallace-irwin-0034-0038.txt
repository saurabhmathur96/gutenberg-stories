THE LOST INVENTOR  BY WALLACE IRWIN

  Patriotic fellow-citizens, and did you ever note 

 How we honor Mr. Fulton, who devised the choo-choo boat? 

 How we glorify our Edison, who made the world to go 

 By the bizzy-whizzy magic of the little dynamo? 

 Yet no spirit-thrilling tribute has been ever heard or seen 

 For the fellow who invented our Political Machine. 



 Sure a fine, inventive genius, who has labored long and hard, 

 Till success has crowned his research, should receive a just reward. 

 The Machine's a great invention, that's continually clear, 

 Out of nothing but corruption making millions every year— 

 Out of muck and filth of cities making dollars neat and clean— 

 Where's the fellow who invented the Political Machine? 



 Hail the complex mechanism, full of cranks and wires and wheels, 

 Fed by graft and loot and patronage, as noiselessly it reels. 

 Press the button, pull the lever, clickety-click, and set the vogue 

 For the latest thing in statesmen or the newest kind of rogue. 

 Who's the man behind the throttle? Who's the Engineer unseen? 

 "Ask me nothin'! Ask me nothin'!" clicks that wizard, the Machine.
