QUIT YO' WORRYIN'

 By Anne Virginia Culbertson

  Nigger nuver worry,— 

 Too much sense fer dat, 

 Let de white folks scurry 

 Roun' an' lose dey fat, 

 Nigger gwine be happy, nuver-min'-you whar he at. 



 Nigger jes' kain't worry,— 

 Set him down an' try, 

 No use, honey, fer he 

 Sho' ter close he eye, 

 Git so pow'ful sleepy dat he pass he troubles by. 



 Cur'ous, now, dis trouble 

 Older dat hit grown, 

 'Stid er gittin' double, 

 Dwinnle ter de bone; 

 Nigger know dat, so dat why he lef' he troubles 'lone. 



 Nigger nuver hurry, 

 Dem w'at wants ter may; 

 Hurry hit mek worry! 

 Now you year me say 

 Ain' gwine hurry down de road ter meet ol' Def half-way!





 Den quit yo' hurryin', 

 Quit yo' worryin'! 

 W'at de use uv all dis scurryin'? 

 Mek ol' Time go sof' an' slow, 

 Tell him you doan' want no mo' 

 Dish yer uverlastin' flurryin',— 

 Jes' a trick er his fer hurryin' 

 Folks de faster to'des dey burryin'!
