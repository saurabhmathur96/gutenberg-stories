THE TURNINGS OF A BOOKWORM

 BY CAROLYN WELLS

  Love levels all plots. 

 Dead men sell no tales. 

 A new boom sweeps clean. 

 Circumstances alter bookcases. 

 The more haste the less read. 

 Too many books spoil the trade. 

 Many hands make light literature. 

 Epigrams cover a multitude of sins. 

 Ye can not serve Art and Mammon. 

 A little sequel is a dangerous thing. 

 It's a long page that has no turning. 

 Don't look a gift-book in the binding. 

 A gilt-edged volume needs no accuser. 

 In a multitude of characters there is safety. 

 Incidents will happen even in the best regulated novels. 

 One touch of Nature makes the whole book sell. 

 Where there's a will there's a detective story. 

 A book in the hand is worth two in the library. 

 An ounce of invention is worth a pound of style. 

 A good name is rather to be chosen than great characters. 

 Where there's so much puff, there must be some buyer.
