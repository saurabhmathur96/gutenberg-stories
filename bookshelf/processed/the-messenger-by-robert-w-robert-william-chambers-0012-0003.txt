The Messenger

 By ROBERT W. CHAMBERS

   Little gray messenger,

 Robed like painted Death,

 Your robe is dust.

 Whom do you seek

 Among lilies and closed buds

 At dusk?



  Among lilies and closed buds

 At dusk,

 Whom do you seek,

 Little gray messenger,

 Robed in the awful panoply

 Of painted Death?

    All-wise,

 Hast thou seen all there is to see with thy two
            eyes?

 Dost thou know all there is to know, and
            so,

 Omniscient,

 Darest thou still to say thy brother lies?

 "The bullet entered here," said Max Fortin, and he placed
    his middle finger over a smooth hole exactly in the center of
    the forehead.

 I sat down upon a mound of dry seaweed and unslung my
    fowling piece.

 The little chemist cautiously felt the edges of the
    shot-hole, first with his middle finger, and then with his
    thumb.

 "Let me see the skull again," said I.

 Max Fortin picked it up from the sod.

 "It's like all the others," he repeated, wiping his glasses
    on his handkerchief. "I thought you might care to see one of
    the skulls, so I brought this over from the gravel pit. The men
    from Bannalec are digging yet. They ought to stop."

 "How many skulls are there altogether?" I inquired.

 "They found thirty-eight skulls; there are thirty-nine noted
    in the list. They lie piled up in the gravel pit on the edge of
    Le Bihan's wheat field. The men are at work yet. Le Bihan is
    going to stop them."

 "Let's go over," said I; and I picked up my gun and started
    across the cliffs, Portin on one side, Môme on the
    other.

 "Who has the list?" I asked, lighting my pipe. "You say
    there is a list?"

 "The list was found rolled up in a brass cylinder," said the
    chemist. He added: "You should not smoke here. You know that if
    a single spark drifted into the wheat—"

 "Ah, but I have a cover to my pipe," said I, smiling.

 Fortin watched me as I closed the pepper-box arrangement
    over the glowing bowl of the pipe. Then he continued:

 "The list was made out on thick yellow paper; the brass tube
    has preserved it. It is as fresh to-day as it was in 1760. You
    shall see it."

 "Is that the date?"

 "The list is dated 'April, 1760.' The Brigadier Durand has
    it. It is not written in French."

 "Not written in French!" I exclaimed.

 "No," replied Fortin solemnly, "it is written in
    Breton."

 "But," I protested, "the Breton language was never written
    or printed in 1760."

 "Except by priests," said the chemist.

 "I have heard of but one priest who ever wrote the Breton
    language," I began.

 Fortin stole a glance at my face.

 "You mean—the Black Priest?" he asked.

 I nodded.

 Fortin opened his mouth to speak again, hesitated, and
    finally shut his teeth obstinately over the wheat stem that he
    was chewing.

 "And the Black Priest?" I suggested encouragingly. But I
    knew it was useless; for it is easier to move the stars from
    their courses than to make an obstinate Breton talk. We walked
    on for a minute or two in silence.

 "Where is the Brigadier Durand?" I asked, motioning
    Môme to come out of the wheat, which he was trampling as
    though it were heather. As I spoke we came in sight of the
    farther edge of the wheat field and the dark, wet mass of
    cliffs beyond.

 "Durand is down there—you can see him; he stands just
    behind the mayor of St. Gildas."

 "I see," said I; and we struck straight down, following a
    sun-baked cattle path across the heather.

 When we reached the edge of the wheat field, Le Bihan, the
    mayor of St. Gildas, called to me, and I tucked my gun under my
    arm and skirted the wheat to where he stood.

 "Thirty-eight skulls," he said in his thin, high-pitched
    voice; "there is but one more, and I am opposed to further
    search. I suppose Fortin told you?"

 I shook hands with him, and returned the salute of the
    Brigadier Durand.

 "I am opposed to further search," repeated Le Bihan,
    nervously picking at the mass of silver buttons which covered
    the front of his velvet and broadcloth jacket like a
    breastplate of scale armor.

 Durand pursed up his lips, twisted his tremendous mustache,
    and hooked his thumbs in his saber belt.

 "As for me," he said, "I am in favor of further search."

 "Further search for what—for the thirty-ninth skull?"
    I asked.

 Le Bihan nodded. Durand frowned at the sunlit sea, rocking
    like a bowl of molten gold from the cliffs to the horizon. I
    followed his eyes. On the dark glistening cliffs, silhouetted
    against the glare of the sea, sat a cormorant, black,
    motionless, its horrible head raised toward heaven.

 "Where is that list, Durand?" I asked.

 The gendarme rummaged in his despatch pouch and produced a
    brass cylinder about a foot long. Very gravely he unscrewed the
    head and dumped out a scroll of thick yellow paper closely
    covered with writing on both sides. At a nod from Le Bihan he
    handed me the scroll. But I could make nothing of the coarse
    writing, now faded to a dull brown.

 "Come, come, Le Bihan," I said impatiently, "translate it,
    won't you? You and Max Fortin make a lot of mystery out of
    nothing, it seems."

 Le Bihan went to the edge of the pit where the three
    Bannalec men were digging, gave an order or two in Breton, and
    turned to me.

 As I came to the edge of the pit the Bannalec men were
    removing a square piece of sailcloth from what appeared to be a
    pile of cobblestones.

 "Look!" said Le Bihan shrilly. I looked. The pile below was
    a heap of skulls. After a moment I clambered down the gravel
    sides of the pit and walked over to the men of Bannalec. They
    saluted me gravely, leaning on their picks and shovels, and
    wiping their sweating faces with sunburned hands.

 "How many?" said I in Breton.

 "Thirty-eight," they replied.

 I glanced around. Beyond the heap of skulls lay two piles of
    human bones. Beside these was a mound of broken, rusted bits of
    iron and steel. Looking closer, I saw that this mound was
    composed of rusty bayonets, saber blades, scythe blades, with
    here and there a tarnished buckle attached to a bit of leather
    hard as iron.

 I picked up a couple of buttons and a belt plate. The
    buttons bore the royal arms of England; the belt plate was
    emblazoned with the English arms and also with the number
    "27."

 "I have heard my grandfather speak of the terrible English
    regiment, the 27th Foot, which landed and stormed the fort up
    there," said one of the Bannalec men.

 "Oh!" said I; "then these are the bones of English
    soldiers?"

 "Yes," said the men of Bannalec.

 Le Bihan was calling to me from the edge of the pit above,
    and I handed the belt plate and buttons to the men and climbed
    the side of the excavation.

 "Well," said I, trying to prevent Môme from leaping up
    and licking my face as I emerged from the pit, "I suppose you
    know what these bones are. What are you going to do with
    them?"

 "There was a man," said Le Bihan angrily, "an Englishman,
    who passed here in a dog-cart on his way to Quimper about an
    hour ago, and what do you suppose he wished to do?"

 "Buy the relics?" I asked, smiling.

 "Exactly—the pig!" piped the mayor of St. Gildas.
    "Jean Marie Tregunc, who found the bones, was standing there
    where Max Fortin stands, and do you know what he answered? He
    spat upon the ground, and said: 'Pig of an Englishman, do you
    take me for a desecrator of graves?'"

 I knew Tregunc, a sober, blue-eyed Breton, who lived from
    one year's end to the other without being able to afford a
    single bit of meat for a meal.

 "How much did the Englishman offer Tregunc?" I asked.

 "Two hundred francs for the skulls alone."

 I thought of the relic hunters and the relic buyers on the
    battlefields of our civil war.

 "Seventeen hundred and sixty is long ago," I said.

 "Respect for the dead can never die," said Fortin.

 "And the English soldiers came here to kill your fathers and
    burn your homes," I continued.

 "They were murderers and thieves, but—they are dead,"
    said Tregunc, coming up from the beach below, his long sea rake
    balanced on his dripping jersey.

 "How much do you earn every year, Jean Marie?" I asked,
    turning to shake hands with him.

 "Two hundred and twenty francs, monsieur."

 "Forty-five dollars a year," I said. "Bah! you are worth
    more, Jean. Will you take care of my garden for me? My wife
    wished me to ask you. I think it would be worth one hundred
    francs a month to you and to me. Come on, Le Bihan—come
    along, Fortin—and you, Durand. I want somebody to
    translate that list into French for me."

 Tregunc stood gazing at me, his blue eyes dilated.

 "You may begin at once," I said, smiling, "if the salary
    suits you?"

 "It suits," said Tregunc, fumbling for his pipe in a silly
    way that annoyed Le Bihan.

 "Then go and begin your work," cried the mayor impatiently;
    and Tregunc started across the moors toward St. Gildas, taking
    off his velvet-ribboned cap to me and gripping his sea rake
    very hard.

 "You offer him more than my salary," said the mayor, after a
    moment's contemplation of his silver buttons.

 "Pooh!" said I, "what do you do for your salary except play
    dominoes with Max Portin at the Groix Inn?"

 Le Bihan turned red, but Durand rattled his saber and winked
    at Max Fortin, and I slipped my arm through the arm of the
    sulky magistrate, laughing.

 "There's a shady spot under the cliff," I said; "come on, Le
    Bihan, and read me what is in the scroll."

 In a few moments we reached the shadow of the cliff, and I
    threw myself upon the turf, chin on hand, to listen.

 The gendarme, Durand, also sat down, twisting his mustache
    into needlelike points. Fortin leaned against the cliff,
    polishing his glasses and examining us with vague, near-sighted
    eyes; and Le Bihan, the mayor, planted himself in our midst,
    rolling up the scroll and tucking it under his arm.

 "First of all," he began in a shrill voice, "I am going to
    light my pipe, and while lighting it I shall tell you what I
    have heard about the attack on the fort yonder. My father told
    me; his father told him."

 He jerked his head in the direction of the ruined fort, a
    small, square stone structure on the sea cliff, now nothing but
    crumbling walls. Then he slowly produced a tobacco pouch, a bit
    of flint and tinder, and a long-stemmed pipe fitted with a
    microscopical bowl of baked clay. To fill such a pipe requires
    ten minutes' close attention. To smoke it to a finish takes but
    four puffs. It is very Breton, this Breton pipe. It is the
    crystallization of everything Breton.

 "Go on," said I, lighting a cigarette.

 "The fort," said the mayor, "was built by Louis XIV, and was
    dismantled twice by the English. Louis XV restored it in 1730.
    In 1760 it was carried by assault by the English. They came
    across from the island of Groix—three shiploads, and they
    stormed the fort and sacked St. Julien yonder, and they started
    to burn St. Gildas—you can see the marks of their bullets
    on my house yet; but the men of Bannalec and the men of Lorient
    fell upon them with pike and scythe and blunderbuss, and those
    who did not run away lie there below in the gravel pit
    now—thirty-eight of them."

 "And the thirty-ninth skull?" I asked, finishing my
    cigarette.

 The mayor had succeeded in filling his pipe, and now he
    began to put his tobacco pouch away.

 "The thirty-ninth skull," he mumbled, holding the pipe stem
    between his defective teeth—"the thirty-ninth skull is no
    business of mine. I have told the Bannalec men to cease
    digging."

 "But what is—whose is the missing skull?" I persisted
    curiously.

 The mayor was busy trying to strike a spark to his tinder.
    Presently he set it aglow, applied it to his pipe, took the
    prescribed four puffs, knocked the ashes out of the bowl, and
    gravely replaced the pipe in his pocket.

 "The missing skull?" he asked.

 "Yes," said I, impatiently.

 The mayor slowly unrolled the scroll and began to read,
    translating from the Breton into French. And this is what he
    read:

 "On the Cliffs of St. Gildas, 

April 13, 1760.

 "On this day, by order of the Count of Soisic, general in
    chief of the Breton forces now lying in Kerselec Forest, the
    bodies of thirty-eight English soldiers of the 27th, 50th, and
    72d regiments of Foot were buried in this spot, together with
    their arms and equipments."

 The mayor paused and glanced at me reflectively.

 "Go on, Le Bihan," I said.

 "With them," continued the mayor, turning the scroll and
    reading on the other side, "was buried the body of that vile
    traitor who betrayed the fort to the English. The manner of his
    death was as follows: By order of the most noble Count of
    Soisic, the traitor was first branded upon the forehead with
    the brand of an arrowhead. The iron burned through the flesh
    and was pressed heavily so that the brand should even burn into
    the bone of the skull. The traitor was then led out and bidden
    to kneel. He admitted having guided the English from the island
    of Groix. Although a priest and a Frenchman, he had violated
    his priestly office to aid him in discovering the password to
    the fort. This password he extorted during confession from a
    young Breton girl who was in the habit of rowing across from
    the island of Groix to visit her husband in the fort. When the
    fort fell, this young girl, crazed by the death of her husband,
    sought the Count of Soisic and told how the priest had forced
    her to confess to him all she knew about the fort. The priest
    was arrested at St. Gildas as he was about to cross the river
    to Lorient. When arrested he cursed the girl, Marie
    Trevec——"

 "What!" I exclaimed, "Marie Trevec!"

 "Marie Trevec," repeated Le Bihan; "the priest cursed Marie
    Trevec, and all her family and descendants. He was shot as he
    knelt, having a mask of leather over his face, because the
    Bretons who composed the squad of execution refused to fire at
    a priest unless his face was concealed. The priest was
    l'Abbé Sorgue, commonly known as the Black Priest on
    account of his dark face and swarthy eyebrows. He was buried
    with a stake through his heart."

 Le Bihan paused, hesitated, looked at me, and handed the
    manuscript back to Durand. The gendarme took it and slipped it
    into the brass cylinder.

 "So," said I, "the thirty-ninth skull is the skull of the
    Black Priest."

 "Yes," said Fortin. "I hope they won't find it."

 "I have forbidden them to proceed," said the mayor
    querulously. "You heard me, Max Fortin."

 I rose and picked up my gun. Môme came and pushed his
    head into my hand.

 "That's a fine dog," observed Durand, also rising.

 "Why don't you wish to find his skull?" I asked Le Bihan.
    "It would be curious to see whether the arrow brand really
    burned into the bone."

 "There is something in that scroll that I didn't read to
    you," said the mayor grimly. "Do you wish to know what it
    is?"

 "Of course," I replied in surprise.

 "Give me the scroll again, Durand," he said; then he read
    from the bottom: "I, l'Abbé Sorgue, forced to write the
    above by my executioners, have written it in my own blood; and
    with it I leave my curse. My curse on St. Gildas, on Marie
    Trevec, and on her descendants. I will come back to St. Gildas
    when my remains are disturbed. Woe to that Englishman whom my
    branded skull shall touch!"

 "What rot!" I said. "Do you believe it was really written in
    his own blood?"

 "I am going to test it," said Fortin, "at the request of
    Monsieur le Maire. I am not anxious for the job, however."

 "See," said Le Bihan, holding out the scroll to me, "it is
    signed, 'L'Abbé Sorgue.'"

 I glanced curiously over the paper.

 "It must be the Black Priest," I said. "He was the only man
    who wrote in the Breton language. This is a wonderfully
    interesting discovery, for now, at last, the mystery of the
    Black Priest's disappearance is cleared up. You will, of
    course, send this scroll to Paris, Le Bihan?"

 "No," said the mayor obstinately, "it shall be buried in the
    pit below where the rest of the Black Priest lies."

 I looked at him and recognized that argument would be
    useless. But still I said, "It will be a loss to history,
    Monsieur Le Bihan."

 "All the worse for history, then," said the enlightened
    Mayor of St. Gildas.

 We had sauntered back to the gravel pit while speaking. The
    men of Bannalec were carrying the bones of the English soldiers
    toward the St. Gildas cemetery, on the cliffs to the east,
    where already a knot of white-coiffed women stood in attitudes
    of prayer; and I saw the somber robe of a priest among the
    crosses of the little graveyard.

 "They were thieves and assassins; they are dead now,"
    muttered Max Fortin.

 "Respect the dead," repeated the Mayor of St. Gildas,
    looking after the Bannalec men.

 "It was written in that scroll that Marie Trevec, of Groix
    Island, was cursed by the priest—she and her
    descendants," I said, touching Le Bihan on the arm. "There was
    a Marie Trevec who married an Yves Trevec of St.
    Gildas——"

 "It is the same," said Le Bihan, looking at me
    obliquely.

 "Oh!" said I; "then they were ancestors of my wife."

 "Do you fear the curse?" asked Le Bihan.

 "What?" I laughed.

 "There was the case of the Purple Emperor," said Max Fortin
    timidly.

 Startled for a moment, I faced him, then shrugged my
    shoulders and kicked at a smooth bit of rock which lay near the
    edge of the pit, almost embedded in gravel.

 "Do you suppose the Purple-Emperor drank himself crazy
    because he was descended from Marie Trevec?" I asked
    contemptuously.

 "Of course not," said Max Fortin hastily.

 "Of course not," piped the mayor. "I only—Hellow!
    what's that you're kicking?"

 "What?" said I, glancing down, at the same time
    involuntarily giving another kick. The smooth bit of rock
    dislodged itself and rolled out of the loosened gravel at my
    feet.

 "The thirty-ninth skull!" I exclaimed. "By jingo, it's the
    noddle of the Black Priest! See! there is the arrowhead branded
    on the front!"

 The mayor stepped back. Max Fortin also retreated. There was
    a pause, during which I looked at them, and they looked
    anywhere but at me.

 "I don't like it," said the mayor at last, in a husky, high
    voice. "I don't like it! The scroll says he will come back to
    St. Gildas when his remains are disturbed. I—I don't like
    it, Monsieur Darrel—"

 "Bosh!" said I; "the poor wicked devil is where he can't get
    out. For Heaven's sake, Le Bihan, what is this stuff you are
    talking in the year of grace 1896?"

 The mayor gave me a look.

 "And he says 'Englishman.' You are an Englishman, Monsieur
    Darrel," he announced.

 "You know better. You know I'm an American."

 "It's all the same," said the Mayor of St. Gildas,
    obstinately.

 "No, it isn't!" I answered, much exasperated, and
    deliberately pushed the skull till it rolled into the bottom of
    the gravel pit below.

 "Cover it up," said I; "bury the scroll with it too, if you
    insist, but I think you ought to send it to Paris. Don't look
    so gloomy, Fortin, unless you believe in werewolves and ghosts.
    Hey! what the—what the devil's the matter with you,
    anyway? What are you staring at, Le Bihan?"

 "Come, come," muttered the mayor in a low, tremulous voice,
    "it's time we got out of this. Did you see? Did you see,
    Fortin?"

 "I saw," whispered Max Fortin, pallid with fright.

 The two men were almost running across the sunny pasture
    now, and I hastened after them, demanding to know what was the
    matter.

 "Matter!" chattered the mayor, gasping with exasperation and
    terror. "The skull is rolling up hill again," and he burst into
    a terrified gallop, Max Fortin followed close behind.

 I watched them stampeding across the pasture, then turned
    toward the gravel pit, mystified, incredulous. The skull was
    lying on the edge of the pit, exactly where it had been before
    I pushed it over the edge. For a second I stared at it; a
    singular chilly feeling crept up my spinal column, and I turned
    and walked away, sweat starting from the root of every hair on
    my head. Before I had gone twenty paces the absurdity of the
    whole thing struck me. I halted, hot with shame and annoyance,
    and retraced my steps.

 There lay the skull.

 "I rolled a stone down instead of the skull," I muttered to
    myself. Then with the butt of my gun I pushed the skull over
    the edge of the pit and watched it roll to the bottom; and as
    it struck the bottom of the pit, Môme, my dog, suddenly
    whipped his tail between his legs, whimpered, and made off
    across the moor.

 "Môme!" I shouted, angry and astonished; but the dog
    only fled the faster, and I ceased calling from sheer
    surprise.

 "What the mischief is the matter with that dog!" I thought.
    He had never before played me such a trick.

 Mechanically I glanced into the pit, but I could not see the
    skull. I looked down. The skull lay at my feet again, touching
    them.

 "Good heavens!" I stammered, and struck at it blindly with
    my gunstock. The ghastly thing flew into the air, whirling over
    and over, and rolled again down the sides of the pit to the
    bottom. Breathlessly I stared at it, then, confused and
    scarcely comprehending, I stepped back from the pit, still
    facing it, one, ten, twenty paces, my eyes almost starting from
    my head, as though I expected to see the thing roll up from the
    bottom of the pit under my very gaze. At last I turned my back
    to the pit and strode out across the gorse-covered moorland
    toward my home. As I reached the road that winds from St.
    Gildas to St. Julien I gave one hasty glance at the pit over my
    shoulder. The sun shone hot on the sod about the excavation.
    There was something white and bare and round on the turf at the
    edge of the pit. It might have been a stone; there were plenty
    of them lying about.

 II

 When I entered my garden I saw Môme sprawling on the
    stone doorstep. He eyed me sideways and flopped his tail.

 "Are you not mortified, you idiot dog?" I said, looking
    about the upper windows for Lys.

 Môme rolled over on his back and raised one
    deprecating forepaw, as though to ward off calamity.

 "Don't act as though I was in the habit of beating you to
    death," I said, disgusted. I had never in my life raised whip
    to the brute. "But you are a fool dog," I continued. "No, you
    needn't come to be babied and wept over; Lys can do that, if
    she insists, but I am ashamed of you, and you can go to the
    devil."

 Môme slunk off into the house, and I followed,
    mounting directly to my wife's boudoir. It was empty.

 "Where has she gone?" I said, looking hard at Môme,
    who had followed me. "Oh! I see you don't know. Don't pretend
    you do. Come off that lounge! Do you think Lys wants
    tan-colored hairs all over her lounge?"

 I rang the bell for Catherine and Fine, but they didn't know
    where "madame" had gone; so I went into my room, bathed,
    exchanged my somewhat grimy shooting clothes for a suit of
    warm, soft knickerbockers, and, after lingering some extra
    moments over my toilet—for I was particular, now that I
    had married Lys—I went down to the garden and took a
    chair out under the fig-trees.

 "Where can she be?" I wondered, Môme came sneaking out
    to be comforted, and I forgave him for Lys's sake, whereupon he
    frisked.

 "You bounding cur," said I, "now what on earth started you
    off across the moor? If you do it again I'll push you along
    with a charge of dust shot."

 As yet I had scarcely dared think about the ghastly
    hallucination of which I had been a victim, but now I faced it
    squarely, flushing a little with mortification at the thought
    of my hasty retreat from the gravel pit.

 "To think," I said aloud, "that those old woman's tales of
    Max Fortin and Le Bihan should have actually made me see what
    didn't exist at all! I lost my nerve like a schoolboy in a dark
    bedroom." For I knew now that I had mistaken a round stone for
    a skull each time, and had pushed a couple of big pebbles into
    the pit instead of the skull itself.

 "By jingo!" said I, "I'm nervous; my liver must be in a
    devil of a condition if I see such things when I'm awake! Lys
    will know what to give me."

 I felt mortified and irritated and sulky, and thought
    disgustedly of Le Bihan and Max Fortin.

 But after a while I ceased speculating, dismissed the mayor,
    the chemist, and the skull from my mind, and smoked pensively,
    watching the sun low dipping in the western ocean. As the
    twilight fell for a moment over ocean and moorland, a wistful,
    restless happiness filled my heart, the happiness that all men
    know—all men who have loved.

 Slowly the purple mist crept out over the sea; the cliffs
    darkened; the forest was shrouded.

 Suddenly the sky above burned with the afterglow, and the
    world was alight again.

 Cloud after cloud caught the rose dye; the cliffs were
    tinted with it; moor and pasture, heather and forest burned and
    pulsated with the gentle flush. I saw the gulls turning and
    tossing above the sand bar, their snowy wings tipped with pink;
    I saw the sea swallows sheering the surface of the still river,
    stained to its placid depths with warm reflections of the
    clouds. The twitter of drowsy hedge birds broke out in the
    stillness; a salmon rolled its shining side above
    tidewater.

 The interminable monotone of the ocean intensified the
    silence. I sat motionless, holding my breath as one who listens
    to the first low rumor of an organ. All at once the pure
    whistle of a nightingale cut the silence, and the first
    moonbeam silvered the wastes of mist-hung waters.

 I raised my head.

 Lys stood before me in the garden.

 When we had kissed each other, we linked arms and moved up
    and down the gravel walks, watching the moonbeams sparkle on
    the sand bar as the tide ebbed and ebbed. The broad beds of
    white pinks about us were atremble with hovering white moths;
    the October roses hung all abloom, perfuming the salt wind.

 "Sweetheart," I said, "where is Yvonne? Has she promised to
    spend Christmas with us?"

 "Yes, Dick; she drove me down from Plougat this afternoon.
    She sent her love to you. I am not jealous. What did you
    shoot?"

 "A hare and four partridges. They are in the gun room. I
    told Catherine not to touch them until you had seen them."

 Now I suppose I knew that Lys could not be particularly
    enthusiastic over game or guns; but she pretended she was, and
    always scornfully denied that it was for my sake and not for
    the pure love of sport. So she dragged me off to inspect the
    rather meager game bag, and she paid me pretty compliments, and
    gave a little cry of delight and pity as I lifted the enormous
    hare out of the sack by his ears.

 "He'll eat no more of our lettuce," I said attempting to
    justify the assassination.

 "Unhappy little bunny—and what a beauty! O Dick, you
    are a splendid shot, are you not?"

 I evaded the question and hauled out a partridge.

 "Poor little dead things'" said Lys in a whisper; "it seems
    a pity—doesn't it, Dick? But then you are so
    clever——"

 "We'll have them broiled," I said guardedly, "tell
    Catherine."

 Catherine came in to take away the game, and presently 'Fine
    Lelocard, Lys's maid, announced dinner, and Lys tripped away to
    her boudoir.

 I stood an instant contemplating her blissfully, thinking,
    "My boy, you're the happiest fellow in the world—you're
    in love with your wife'"

 I walked into the dining-room, beamed at the plates, walked
    out again; met Tregunc in the hallway, beamed on him; glanced
    into the kitchen, beamed at Catherine, and went up stairs,
    still beaming.

 Before I could knock at Lys's door it opened, and Lys came
    hastily out. When she saw me she gave a little cry of relief,
    and nestled close to my breast.

 "There is something peering in at my window," she said.

 "What!" I cried angrily.

 "A man, I think, disguised as a priest, and he has a mask
    on. He must have climbed up by the bay tree."

 I was down the stairs and out of doors in no time. The
    moonlit garden was absolutely deserted. Tregunc came up, and
    together we searched the hedge and shrubbery around the house
    and out to the road.

 "Jean Marie," said I at length, "loose my bulldog—he
    knows you—and take your supper on the porch where you can
    watch. My wife says the fellow is disguised as a priest, and
    wears a mask."

 Tregunc showed his white teeth in a smile. "He will not care
    to venture in here again, I think, Monsieur Darrel."

 I went back and found Lys seated quietly at the table.

 "The soup is ready, dear," she said. "Don't worry; it was
    only some foolish lout from Bannalec. No one in St. Gildas or
    St. Julien would do such a thing."

 I was too much exasperated to reply at first, but Lys
    treated it as a stupid joke, and after a while I began to look
    at it in that light.

 Lys told me about Yvonne, and reminded me of my promise to
    have Herbert Stuart down to meet her.

 "You wicked diplomat!" I protested. "Herbert is in Paris,
    and hard at work for the Salon."

 "Don't you think he might spare a week to flirt with the
    prettiest girl in Finistere?" inquired Lys innocently.

 "Prettiest girl! Not much!" I said.

 "Who is, then?" urged Lys.

 I laughed a trifle sheepishly.

 "I suppose you mean me, Dick," said Lys, coloring up.

 "Now I bore you, don't I?"

 "Bore me? Ah, no, Dick."

 After coffee and cigarettes were served I spoke about
    Tregunc, and Lys approved.

 "Poor Jean! He will be glad, won't he? What a dear fellow
    you are!"

 "Nonsense," said I; "we need a gardener; you said so
    yourself, Lys."

 But Lys leaned over and kissed me, and then bent down and
    hugged Môme—who whistled through his nose in
    sentimental appreciation.

 "I am a very happy woman," said Lys.

 "Môme was a very bad dog to-day," I observed.

 "Poor Môme!" said Lys, smiling.

 When dinner was over and Môme lay snoring before the
    blaze—for the October nights are often chilly in
    Finistere—Lys curled up in the chimney corner with her
    embroidery, and gave me a swift glance from under her dropping
    lashes.

 "You look like a schoolgirl, Lys," I said teasingly. "I
    don't believe you are sixteen yet."

 She pushed back her heavy burnished hair thoughtfully. Her
    wrist was as white as surf foam.

 "Have we been married four years? I don't believe it," I
    said.

 She gave me another swift glance and touched the embroidery
    on her knee, smiling faintly.

 "I see," said I, also smiling at the embroidered garment.
    "Do you think it will fit?"

 "Fit?" repeated Lys. Then she laughed

 "And," I persisted, "are you perfectly sure that
    you—er—we shall need it?"

 "Perfectly," said Lys. A delicate color touched her cheeks
    and neck. She held up the little garment, all fluffy with misty
    lace and wrought with quaint embroidery.

 "It is very gorgeous," said I; "don't use your eyes too
    much, dearest. May I smoke a pipe?"

 "Of course," she said selecting a skein of pale blue
    silk.

 For a while I sat and smoked in silence, watching her
    slender fingers among the tinted silks and thread of gold.

 Presently she spoke: "What did you say your crest is,
    Dick?"

 "My crest? Oh, something or other rampant on a something or
    other——"

 "Dick!"

 "Dearest?"

 "Don't be flippant."

 "But I really forget. It's an ordinary crest; everybody in
    New York has them. No family should be without 'em."

 "You are disagreeable, Dick. Send Josephine upstairs for my
    album."

 "Are you going to put that crest on
    the—the—whatever it is?"

 "I am; and my own crest, too."

 I thought of the Purple Emperor and wondered a little.

 "You didn't know I had one, did you?" she smiled.

 "What is it?" I replied evasively.

 "You shall see. Ring for Josephine."

 I rang, and, when 'Fine appeared, Lys gave her some orders
    in a low voice, and Josephine trotted away, bobbing her
    white-coiffed head with a "Bien, Madame!"

 After a few minutes she returned, bearing a tattered, musty
    volume, from which the gold and blue had mostly
    disappeared.

 I took the book in my hands and examined the ancient
    emblazoned covers.

 "Lilies!" I exclaimed.

 "Fleur-de-lis," said my wife demurely.

 "Oh!" said I, astonished, and opened the book.

 "You have never before seen this book?" asked Lys, with a
    touch of malice in her eyes.

 "You know I haven't. Hello! What's this? Oho! So there
    should be a de before Trevec? Lys de Trevec? Then why in the
    world did the Purple Emperor——"

 "Dick!" cried Lys.

 "All right," said I. "Shall I read about the Sieur de Trevec
    who rode to Saladin's tent alone to seek for medicine for St.
    Louise? Or shall I read about—what is it? Oh, here it is,
    all down in black and white—about the Marquis de Trevec
    who drowned himself before Alva's eyes rather than surrender
    the banner of the fleur-de-lis to Spain? It's all written here.
    But, dear, how about that soldier named Trevec who was killed
    in the old fort on the cliff yonder?"

 "He dropped the de, and the Trevecs since then have been
    Republicans," said Lys—"all except me."

 "That's quite right," said I; "it is time that we
    Republicans should agree upon some feudal system. My dear, I
    drink to the king!" and I raised my wine glass and looked at
    Lys.

 "To the king," said Lys, flushing. She smoothed out the tiny
    garment on her knees; she touched the glass with her lips; her
    eyes were very sweet. I drained the glass to the king.

 After a silence I said: "I will tell the king stories. His
    majesty shall be amused."

 "His majesty," repeated Lys softly.

 "Or hers," I laughed. "Who knows?"

 "Who knows?" murmured Lys; with a gentle sigh.

 "I know some stories about Jack the Giant-Killer," I
    announced. "Do you, Lys?"

 "I? No, not about a giant-killer, but I know all about the
    werewolf, and Jeanne-la-Flamme, and the Man in Purple Tatters,
    and—O dear me, I know lots more."

 "You are very wise," said I. "I shall teach his majesty,
    English."

 "And I Breton," cried Lys jealously.

 "I shall bring playthings to the king," said I—"big
    green lizards from the gorse, little gray mullets to swim in
    glass globes, baby rabbits from the forest of
    Kerselec——"

 "And I," said Lys, "will bring the first primrose, the first
    branch of aubepine, the first jonquil, to the king—my
    king."

 "Our king," said I; and there was peace in Finistere.

 I lay back, idly turning the leaves of the curious old
    volume.

 "I am looking," said I, "for the crest."

 "The crest, dear? It is a priest's head with an arrow-shaped
    mark on the forehead, on a field——"

 I sat up and stared at my wife.

 "Dick, whatever is the matter?" she smiled. "The story is
    there in that book. Do you care to read it? No? Shall I tell it
    to you? Well, then: It happened in the third crusade. There was
    a monk whom men called the Black Priest. He turned apostate,
    and sold himself to the enemies of Christ. A Sieur de Trevec
    burst into the Saracen camp, at the head of only one hundred
    lances, and carried the Black Priest away out of the very midst
    of their army."

 "So that is how you come by the crest," I said quietly; but
    I thought of the branded skull in the gravel pit, and
    wondered.

 "Yes," said Lys. "The Sieur de Trevec cut the Black Priest's
    head off, but first he branded him with an arrow mark on the
    forehead. The book says it was a pious action, and the Sieur de
    Trevec got great merit by it. But I think it was cruel, the
    branding," she sighed.

 "Did you ever hear of any other Black Priest?"

 "Yes. There was one in the last century, here in St. Gildas.
    He cast a white shadow in the sun. He wrote in the Breton
    language. Chronicles, too, I believe. I never saw them. His
    name was the same as that of the old chronicler, and of the
    other priest, Jacques Sorgue. Some said he was a lineal
    descendant of the traitor. Of course the first Black Priest was
    bad enough for anything. But if he did have a child, it need
    not have been the ancestor of the last Jacques Sorgue. They say
    he was so good he was not allowed to die, but was caught up to
    heaven one day," added Lys, with believing eyes.

 I smiled.

 "But he disappeared," persisted Lys.

 "I'm afraid his journey was in another direction," I said
    jestingly, and thoughtlessly told her the story of the morning.
    I had utterly forgotten the masked man at her window, but
    before I finished I remembered him fast enough, and realized
    what I had done as I saw her face whiten.

 "Lys," I urged tenderly, "that was only some clumsy clown's
    trick. You said so yourself. You are not superstitious, my
    dear?"

 Her eyes were on mine. She slowly drew the little gold cross
    from her bosom and kissed it. But her lips trembled as they
    pressed the symbol of faith.

 III

 About nine o'clock the next morning I walked into the Groix
    Inn and sat down at the long discolored oaken table, nodding
    good-day to Marianne Bruyere, who in turn bobbed her white
    coiffe at me.

 "My clever Bannalec maid," said I, "what is good for a
    stirrup-cup at the Groix Inn?"

 "Schist?" she inquired in Breton.

 "With a dash of red wine, then," I replied.

 She brought the delicious Quimperle cider, and I poured a
    little Bordeaux into it. Marianne watched me with laughing
    black eyes.

 "What makes your cheeks so red, Marianne?" I asked. "Has
    Jean Marie been here?"

 "We are to be married, Monsieur Darrel," she laughed.

 "Ah! Since when has Jean Marie Tregunc lost his head?"

 "His head? Oh, Monsieur Darrel—his heart, you
    mean!"

 "So I do," said I. "Jean Marie is a practical fellow."

 "It is all due to your kindness—" began the girl, but
    I raised my hand and held up the glass.

 "It's due to himself. To your happiness, Marianne"; and I
    took a hearty draught of the schist. "Now," said I, "tell me
    where I can find Le Bihan and Max Fortin."

 "Monsieur Le Bihan and Monsieur Fortin are above in the
    broad room. I believe they are examining the Red Admiral's
    effects."

 "To send them to Paris? Oh, I know. May I go up,
    Marianne?"

 "And God go with you," smiled the girl.

 When I knocked at the door of the broad room above little
    Max Fortin opened it. Dust covered his spectacles and nose; his
    hat, with the tiny velvet ribbons fluttering, was all awry.

 "Come in, Monsieur Darrel," he said; "the mayor and I are
    packing up the effects of the Purple Emperor and of the poor
    Red Admiral."

 "The collections?" I asked, entering the room. "You must be
    very careful in packing those butterfly cases; the slightest
    jar might break wings and antennas, you know."

 Le Bihan shook hands with me and pointed to the great pile
    of boxes.

 "They're all cork lined," he said, "but Fortin and I are
    putting felt around each box. The Entomological Society of
    Paris pays the freight."

 The combined collection of the Red Admiral and the Purple
    Emperor made a magnificent display.

 I lifted and inspected case after case set with gorgeous
    butterflies and moths, each specimen carefully labelled with
    the name in Latin. There were cases filled with crimson tiger
    moths all aflame with color; cases devoted to the common yellow
    butterflies; symphonies in orange and pale yellow; cases of
    soft gray and dun-colored sphinx moths; and cases of grayish
    nettle-bed butterflies of the numerous family of Vanessa.

 All alone in a great case by itself was pinned the purple
    emperor, the Apatura Iris, that fatal specimen that had given
    the Purple Emperor his name and quietus.

 I remembered the butterfly, and stood looking at it with
    bent eyebrows.

 Le Bihan glanced up from the floor where he was nailing down
    the lid of a box full of cases.

 "It is settled, then," said he, "that madame, your wife,
    gives the Purple Emperor's entire Collection to the city of
    Paris?"

 I nodded.

 "Without accepting anything for it?"

 "It is a gift," I said.

 "Including the purple emperor there in the case? That
    butterfly is worth a great deal of money," persisted Le
    Bihan.

 "You don't suppose that we would wish to sell that specimen,
    do you?" I answered a trifle sharply.

 "If I were you I should destroy it," said the mayor in his
    high-pitched voice.

 "That would be nonsense," said I, "like your burying the
    brass cylinder and scroll yesterday."

 "It was not nonsense," said Le Bihan doggedly, "and I should
    prefer not to discuss the subject of the scroll."

 I looked at Max Portin, who immediately avoided my eyes.

 "You are a pair of superstitious old women," said I, digging
    my hands into my pockets; "you swallow every nursery tale that
    is invented."

 "What of it?" said Le Bihan sulkily; "there's more truth
    than lies in most of 'em."

 "Oh!" I sneered, "does the Mayor of St. Gildas and St.
    Julien believe in the loup-garou?"

 "No, not in the loup-garou."

 "In what, then—Jeanne-la-Flamme?"

 "That," said Le Bihan with conviction, "is history."

 "The devil it is!" said I; "and perhaps, Monsieur the mayor,
    your faith in giants is unimpaired?"

 "There were giants—everybody knows it," growled Max
    Fortin.

 "And you a chemist!" I observed scornfully.

 "Listen, Monsieur Darrel," squeaked Le Bihan; "you know
    yourself that the Purple Emperor was a scientific man. Now
    suppose I should tell you that he always refused to include in
    his collection a Death's Messenger?"

 "A what?" I exclaimed.

 "You know what I mean—that moth that flies by night;
    some call it the Death's Head, but in St. Gildas we call it
    'Death's Messenger.'"

 "Oh!" said I, "you mean that big sphinx moth that is
    commonly known as the 'death's-head moth.' Why the mischief
    should the people here call it death's messenger?"

 "For hundreds of years it has been known as death's
    messenger in St. Gildas," said Max Fortin. "Even Froissart
    speaks of it in his commentaries on Jacques Sorgue's Chronicles

. The book is in your library."

 "Sorgue? And who was Jacques Sorgue? I never read his
    book."

 "Jacques Sorgue

was the son of some unfrocked priest—I forget. It
         was during the crusades."

 "Good Heavens!" I burst out, "I've been hearing of nothing
    but crusades and priests and death and sorcery ever since I
    kicked that skull into the gravel pit, and I am tired of it, I
    tell you frankly. One would think we lived in the dark ages. Do
    you know what year of our Lord it is, Le Bihan?"

 "Eighteen hundred and ninety-six," replied the mayor.

 "And yet you two hulking men are afraid of a death's-head
    moth."

 "I don't care to have one fly into the window," said Max
    Fortin; "it means evil to the house and the people in it."

 "God alone knows why he marked one of his creatures with a
    yellow death's head on the back," observed Le Bihan piously,
    "but I take it that he meant it as a warning; and I propose to
    profit by it," he added triumphantly.

 "See here, Le Bihan," I said; "by a stretch of imagination
    one can make out a skull on the thorax of a certain big sphinx
    moth. What of it?"

 "It is a bad thing to touch," said the mayor wagging his
    head.

 "It squeaks when handled," added Max Fortin.

 "Some creatures squeak all the time," I observed, looking
    hard at Le Bihan.

 "Pigs," added the mayor.

 "Yes, and asses," I replied. "Listen, Le Bihan: do you mean
    to tell me that you saw that skull roll uphill yesterday?"

 The mayor shut his mouth tightly and picked up his
    hammer.

 "Don't be obstinate," I said; "I asked you a question."

 "And I refuse to answer," snapped Le Bihan. "Fortin saw what
    I saw; let him talk about it."

 I looked searchingly at the little chemist.

 "I don't say that I saw it actually roll up out of the pit,
    all by itself," said Fortin with a shiver, "but—but then,
    how did it come up out of the pit, if it didn't roll up all by
    itself?"

 "It didn't come up at all; that was a yellow cobblestone
    that you mistook for the skull again," I replied. "You were
    nervous, Max."

 "A—a very curious cobblestone, Monsieur Darrel," said
    Fortin.

 "I also was a victim to the same hallucination," I
    continued, "and I regret to say that I took the trouble to roll
    two innocent cobblestones into the gravel pit, imagining each
    time that it was the skull I was rolling."

 "It was," observed Le Bihan with a morose shrug.

 "It just shows," said I, ignoring the mayor's remark, "how
    easy it is to fix up a train of coincidences so that the result
    seems to savor of the supernatural. Now, last night my wife
    imagined that she saw a priest in a mask peer in at her
    window——"

 Fortin and Le Bihan scrambled hastily from their knees,
    dropping hammer and nails.

 "W-h-a-t—what's that?" demanded the mayor.

 I repeated what I had said. Max Fortin turned livid.

 "My God!" muttered Le Bihan, "the Black Priest is in St.
    Gildas!"

 "D-don't you—you know the old prophecy?" stammered
    Fortin; "Froissart quotes it from Jacques Sorgue:

   "'When the Black Priest rises from the dead,

 St. Gildas folk shall shriek in bed;

 When the Black Priest rises from his grave,

 May the good God St. Gildas save!'"





 "Aristide Le Bihan," I said angrily, "and you, Max Fortin,
    I've got enough of this nonsense! Some foolish lout from
    Bannalec has been in St. Gildas playing tricks to frighten old
    fools like you. If you have nothing better to talk about than
    nursery legends I'll wait until you come to your senses.
    Good-morning." And I walked out, more disturbed than I cared to
    acknowledge to myself.

 The day had become misty and overcast. Heavy, wet clouds
    hung in the east. I heard the surf thundering against the
    cliffs, and the gray gulls squealed as they tossed and turned
    high in the sky. The tide was creeping across the river sands,
    higher, higher, and I saw the seaweed floating on the beach,
    and the lancons springing from the foam, silvery threadlike
    flashes in the gloom. Curlew were flying up the river in twos
    and threes; the timid sea swallows skimmed across the moors
    toward some quiet, lonely pool, safe from the coming tempest.
    In every hedge field birds were gathering, huddling together,
    twittering restlessly.

 When I reached the cliffs I sat down, resting my chin on my
    clenched hands. Already a vast curtain of rain, sweeping across
    the ocean miles away, hid the island of Groix. To the east,
    behind the white semaphore on the hills, black clouds crowded
    up over the horizon. After a little the thunder boomed, dull,
    distant, and slender skeins of lightning unraveled across the
    crest of the coming storm. Under the cliff at my feet the surf
    rushed foaming over the shore, and the lancons jumped and
    skipped and quivered until they seemed to be but the
    reflections of the meshed lightning.

 I turned to the east. It was raining over Groix, it was
    raining at Sainte Barbe, it was raining now at the semaphore.
    High in the storm whirl a few gulls pitched; a nearer cloud
    trailed veils of rain in its wake; the sky was spattered with
    lightning; the thunder boomed.

 As I rose to go, a cold raindrop fell upon the back of my
    hand, and another, and yet another on my face. I gave a last
    glance at the sea, where the waves were bursting into strange
    white shapes that seemed to fling out menacing arms toward me.
    Then something moved on the cliff, something black as the black
    rock it clutched—a filthy cormorant, craning its hideous
    head at the sky.

 Slowly I plodded homeward across the somber moorland, where
    the gorse stems glimmered with a dull metallic green, and the
    heather, no longer violet and purple, hung drenched and
    dun-colored among the dreary rocks. The wet turf creaked under
    my heavy boots, the black-thorn scraped and grated against knee
    and elbow. Over all lay a strange light, pallid, ghastly, where
    the sea spray whirled across the landscape and drove into my
    face until it grew numb with the cold. In broad bands, rank
    after rank, billow on billow, the rain burst out across the
    endless moors, and yet there was no wind to drive it at such a
    pace.

 Lys stood at the door as I turned into the garden, motioning
    me to hasten; and then for the first time I became conscious
    that I was soaked to the skin.

 "However in the world did you come to stay out when such a
    storm threatened?" she said. "Oh, you are dripping! Go quickly
    and change; I have laid your warm underwear on the bed,
    Dick."

 I kissed my wife, and went upstairs to change my dripping
    clothes for something more comfortable.

 When I returned to the morning room there was a driftwood
    fire on the hearth, and Lys sat in the chimney corner
    embroidering.

 "Catherine tells me that the fishing fleet from Lorient is
    out. Do you think they are in danger, dear?" asked Lys, raising
    her blue eyes to mine as I entered.

 "There is no wind, and there will be no sea," said I,
    looking out of the window. Far across the moor I could see the
    black cliffs looming in the mist.

 "How it rains!" murmured Lys; "come to the fire, Dick."

 I threw myself on the fur rug, my hands in my pockets, my
    head on Lys's knees.

 "Tell me a story," I said. "I feel like a boy of ten."

 Lys raised a finger to her scarlet lips. I always waited for
    her to do that.

 "Will you be very still, then?" she said.

 "Still as death."

 "Death," echoed a voice, very softly.

 "Did you speak, Lys?" I asked, turning so that I could see
    her face.

 "No; did you, Dick?"

 "Who said 'death'?" I asked, startled.

 "Death," echoed a voice, softly.

 I sprang up and looked about. Lys rose too, her needles and
    embroidery falling to the floor. She seemed about to faint,
    leaning heavily on me, and I led her to the window and opened
    it a little way to give her air. As I did so the chain
    lightning split the zenith, the thunder crashed, and a sheet of
    rain swept into the room, driving with it something that
    fluttered—something that flapped, and squeaked, and beat
    upon the rug with soft, moist wings.

 We bent over it together, Lys clinging to me, and we saw
    that it was a death's-head moth drenched with rain.

 The dark day passed slowly as we sat beside the fire, hand
    in hand, her head against my breast, speaking of sorrow and
    mystery and death. For Lys believed that there were things on
    earth that none might understand, things that must be nameless
    forever and ever, until God rolls up the scroll of life and all
    is ended. We spoke of hope and fear and faith, and the mystery
    of the saints; we spoke of the beginning and the end, of the
    shadow of sin, of omens, and of love. The moth still lay on the
    floor quivering its somber wings in the warmth of the fire, the
    skull and ribs clearly etched upon its neck and body.

 "If it is a messenger of death to this house," I said, "why
    should we fear, Lys?"

 "Death should be welcome to those who love God," murmured
    Lys, and she drew the cross from her breast and kissed it.

 "The moth might die if I threw it out into the storm," I
    said after a silence.

 "Let it remain," sighed Lys.

 Late that night my wife lay sleeping, and I sat beside her
    bed and read in the Chronicle of Jacques Sorgue. I shaded the
    candle, but Lys grew restless, and finally I took the book down
    into the morning room, where the ashes of the fire rustled and
    whitened on the hearth.

 The death's-head moth lay on the rug before the fire where I
    had left it. At first I thought it was dead, but when I looked
    closer I saw a lambent fire in its amber eyes. The straight
    white shadow it cast across the floor wavered as the candle
    flickered.

 The pages of the Chronicle of Jacques Sorgue were damp and
    sticky; the illuminated gold and blue initials left flakes of
    azure and gilt where my hand brushed them.

 "It is not paper at all; it is thin parchment," I said to
    myself; and I held the discolored page close to the candle
    flame and read, translating laboriously:

 "I, Jacques Sorgue, saw all these things. And I saw the
    Black Mass celebrated in the chapel of St. Gildas-on-the-Cliff.
    And it was said by the Abbé Sorgue, my kinsman: for
    which deadly sin the apostate priest was seized by the most
    noble Marquis of Plougastel and by him condemned to be burned
    with hot irons, until his seared soul quit its body and fly to
    its master the devil. But when the Black Priest lay in the
    crypt of Plougastel, his master Satan came at night and set him
    free, and carried him across land and sea to Mahmoud, which is
    Soldan or Saladin. And I, Jacques Sorgue, traveling afterward
    by sea, beheld with my own eyes my kinsman, the Black Priest of
    St. Gildas, borne along in the air upon a vast black wing,
    which was the wing of his master Satan. And this was seen also
    by two men of the crew."

 I turned the page. The wings of the moth on the floor began
    to quiver. I read on and on, my eyes blurring under the
    shifting candle flame. I read of battles and of saints, and I
    learned how the Great Soldan made his pact with Satan, and then
    I came to the Sieur de Trevec, and read how he seized the Black
    Priest in the midst of Saladin's tents and carried him away and
    cut off his head first branding him on the forehead. "And
    before he suffered," said the Chronicle, "he cursed the Sieur
    de Trevec and his descendants, and he said he would surely
    return to St. Gildas. 'For the violence you do to me, I will do
    violence to you. For the evil I suffer at your hands, I will
    work evil on you and your descendants. Woe to your children,
    Sieur de Trevec!'" There was a whirr, a beating of strong
    wings, and my candle flashed up as in a sudden breeze. A
    humming filled the room; the great moth darted hither and
    thither, beating, buzzing, on ceiling and wall. I flung down my
    book and stepped forward. Now it lay fluttering upon the window
    sill, and for a moment I had it under my hand, but the thing
    squeaked and I shrank back. Then suddenly it darted across the
    candle flame; the light flared and went out, and at the same
    moment a shadow moved in the darkness outside. I raised my eyes
    to the window. A masked face was peering in at me.

 Quick as thought I whipped out my revolver and fired every
    cartridge, but the face advanced beyond the window, the glass
    melting away before it like mist, and through the smoke of my
    revolver I saw something creep swiftly into the room. Then I
    tried to cry out, but the thing was at my throat, and I fell
    backward among the ashes of the hearth.

  When my eyes unclosed I was lying on the hearth, my head
    among the cold ashes. Slowly I got on my knees, rose painfully,
    and groped my way to a chair. On the floor lay my revolver,
    shining in the pale light of early morning. My mind clearing by
    degrees, I looked, shuddering, at the window. The glass was
    unbroken. I stooped stiffly, picked up my revolver and opened
    the cylinder. Every cartridge had been fired. Mechanically I
    closed the cylinder and placed the revolver in my pocket. The
    book, the Chronicles of Jacques Sorgue, lay on the table beside
    me, and as I started to close it I glanced at the page. It was
    all splashed with rain, and the lettering had run, so that the
    page was merely a confused blur of gold and red and black. As I
    stumbled toward the door I cast a fearful glance over my
    shoulder. The death's-head moth crawled shivering on the
    rug.

 IV

 The sun was about three hours high. I must have slept, for I
    was aroused by the sudden gallop of horses under our window.
    People were shouting and calling in the road. I sprang up and
    opened the sash. Le Bihan was there, an image of helplessness,
    and Max Fortin stood beside him polishing his glasses. Some
    gendarmes had just arrived from Quimperle, and I could hear
    them around the corner of the house, stamping, and rattling
    their sabres and carbines, as they led their horses into my
    stable.

 Lys sat up, murmuring half-sleepy, half-anxious
    questions.

 "I don't know," I answered. "I am going out to see what it
    means."

 "It is like the day they came to arrest you," Lys said,
    giving me a troubled look. But I kissed her and laughed at her
    until she smiled too. Then I flung on coat and cap and hurried
    down the stairs.

 The first person I saw standing in the road was the
    Brigadier Durand.

 "Hello!" said I, "have you come to arrest me again? What the
    devil is all this fuss about, anyway?"

 "We were telegraphed for an hour ago," said Durand briskly,
    "and for a sufficient reason, I think. Look there, Monsieur
    Darrel!"

 He pointed to the ground almost under my feet.

 "Good heavens!" I cried, "where did that puddle of blood
    come from?"

 "That's what I want to know, Monsieur Darrel. Max Fortin
    found it at daybreak. See, it's splashed all over the grass,
    too. A trail of it leads into your garden, across the flower
    beds to your very window, the one that opens from the morning
    room. There is another trail leading from this spot across the
    road to the cliffs, then to the gravel pit, and thence across
    the moor to the forest of Kerselec. We are going to mount in a
    minute and search the bosquets. Will you join us? Bon Dieu! but
    the fellow bled like an ox. Max Fortin says it's human blood,
    or I should not have believed it."

 The little chemist of Quimperle came up at that moment,
    rubbing his glasses with a colored handkerchief.

 "Yes, it is human blood," he said, "but one thing puzzles
    me: the corpuscles are yellow. I never saw any human blood
    before with yellow corpuscles. But your English Doctor Thompson
    asserts that he has——"

 "Well, it's human blood, anyway—isn't it?" insisted
    Durand, impatiently.

 "Ye-es," admitted Max Fortin.

 "Then it's my business to trail it," said the big gendarme,
    and he called his men and gave the order to mount.

 "Did you hear anything last night?" asked Durand of me.

 "I heard the rain. I wonder the rain did not wash away these
    traces."

 "They must have come after the rain ceased. See this thick
    splash, how it lies over and weighs down the wet grass blades.
    Pah!"

 It was a heavy, evil-looking clot, and I stepped back from
    it, my throat closing in disgust.

 "My theory," said the brigadier, "is this: Some of those
    Biribi fishermen, probably the Icelanders, got an extra glass
    of cognac into their hides and quarreled on the road. Some of
    them were slashed, and staggered to your house. But there is
    only one trail, and yet—and yet, how could all that blood
    come from only one person? Well, the wounded man, let us say,
    staggered first to your house and then back here, and he
    wandered off, drunk and dying, God knows where. That's my
    theory."

 "A very good one," said I calmly. "And you are going to
    trail him?"

 "Yes."

 "When?"

 "At once. Will you come?"

 "Not now. I'll gallop over by-and-bye. You are going to the
    edge of the Kerselec forest?"

 "Yes; you will hear us calling. Are you coming, Max Fortin?
    And you, Le Bihan? Good; take the dog-cart."

 The big gendarme tramped around the corner to the stable and
    presently returned mounted on a strong gray horse, his sabre
    shone on his saddle; his pale yellow and white facings were
    spotless. The little crowd of white-coiffed women with their
    children fell back as Durand touched spurs and clattered away
    followed by his two troopers. Soon after Le Bihan and Max
    Fortin also departed in the mayor's dingy dog-cart.

 "Are you coming?" piped Le Bihan shrilly.

 "In a quarter of an hour," I replied, and went back to the
    house.

 When I opened the door of the morning room the death's-head
    moth was beating its strong wings against the window. For a
    second I hesitated, then walked over and opened the sash. The
    creature fluttered out, whirred over the flower beds a moment,
    then darted across the moorland toward the sea. I called the
    servants together and questioned them. Josephine, Catherine,
    Jean Marie Tregunc, not one of them had heard the slightest
    disturbance during the night. Then I told Jean Marie to saddle
    my horse, and while I was speaking Lys came down.

 "Dearest," I began, going to her.

 "You must tell me everything you know, Dick," she
    interrupted, looking me earnestly in the face.

 "But there is nothing to tell—only a drunken brawl,
    and some one wounded."

 "And you are going to ride—where, Dick?"

 "Well, over to the edge of Kerselec forest. Durand and the
    mayor, and Max Fortin, have gone on, following a—a
    trail."

 "What trail?"

 "Some blood."

 "Where did they find it?"

 "Out in the road there." Lys crossed herself.

 "Does it come near our house?"

 "Yes."

 "How near?"

 "It comes up to the morning room window," said I, giving
    in.

 Her hand on my arm grew heavy. "I dreamed last
    night——"

 "So did I—" but I thought of the empty cartridges in
    my revolver, and stopped.

 "I dreamed that you were in great danger, and I could not
    move hand or foot to save you; but you had your revolver, and I
    called out to you to fire——"

 "I did fire!" I cried excitedly.

 "You—you fired?"

 I took her in my arms. "My darling," I said "something
    strange has happened—something that I cannot understand
    as yet. But, of course, there is an explanation. Last night I
    thought I fired at the Black Priest."

 "Ah!" gasped Lys.

 "Is that what you dreamed?"

 "Yes, yes, that was it! I begged you to
    fire——"

 "And I did."

 Her heart was beating against my breast. I held her close in
    silence.

 "Dick," she said at length, "perhaps you killed
    the—the thing."

 "If it was human I did not miss," I answered grimly. "And it
    was human," I went on, pulling myself together, ashamed of
    having so nearly gone to pieces. "Of course it was human! The
    whole affair is plain enough. Not a drunken brawl, as Durand
    thinks; it was a drunken lout's practical joke, for which he
    has suffered. I suppose I must have filled him pretty full of
    bullets, and he has crawled away to die in Kerselec forest.
    It's a terrible affair; I'm sorry I fired so hastily; but that
    idiot Le Bihan and Max Fortin have been working on my nerves
    till I am as hysterical as a schoolgirl," I ended angrily.

 "You fired—but the window glass was not shattered,"
    said Lys in a low voice.

 "Well, the window was open, then. And as for the—the
    rest—I've got nervous indigestion, and a doctor will
    settle the Black Priest for me, Lys."

 I glanced out of the window at Tregunc waiting with my horse
    at the gate.

 "Dearest, I think I had better go to join Durand and the
    others."

 "I will go, too."

 "Oh, no!"

 "Yes, Dick."

 "Don't, Lys."

 "I shall suffer every moment you are away."

 "The ride is too fatiguing, and we can't tell what
    unpleasant sight you may come upon. Lys, you don't really think
    there is anything supernatural in this affair?"

 "Dick," she answered gently, "I am a Bretonne." With both
    arms around my neck, my wife said, "Death is the gift of God. I
    do not fear it when we are together. But alone—oh, my
    husband, I should fear a God who could take you away from
    me!"

 We kissed each other soberly, simply, like two children.
    Then Lys hurried away to change her gown, and I paced up and
    down the garden waiting for her.

 She came, drawing on her slender gauntlets. I swung her into
    the saddle, gave a hasty order to Jean Marie, and mounted.

 Now, to quail under thoughts of terror on a morning like
    this, with Lys in the saddle beside me, no matter what had
    happened or might happen was impossible. Moreover, Môme
    came sneaking after us. I asked Tregunc to catch him, for I was
    afraid he might be brained by our horses' hoofs if he followed,
    but the wily puppy dodged and bolted after Lys, who was
    trotting along the highroad. "Never mind," I thought; "if he's
    hit he'll live, for he has no brains to lose."

 Lys was waiting for me in the road beside the Shrine of Our
    Lady of St. Gildas when I joined her. She crossed herself, I
    doffed my cap, then we shook out our bridles and galloped
    toward the forest of Kerselec.

 We said very little as we rode. I always loved to watch Lys
    in the saddle. Her exquisite figure and lovely face were the
    incarnation of youth and grace; her curling hair glistened like
    threaded gold.

 Out of the corner of my eye I saw the spoiled puppy
    Môme come bounding cheerfully alongside, oblivious of our
    horses' heels. Our road swung close to the cliffs. A filthy
    cormorant rose from the black rocks and flapped heavily across
    our path. Lys's horse reared, but she pulled him down, and
    pointed at the bird with her riding crop.

 "I see," said I; "it seems to be going our way. Curious to
    see a cormorant in a forest, isn't it?"

 "It is a bad sign," said Lys. "You know the Morbihan
    proverb: 'When the cormorant turns from the sea, Death laughs
    in the forest, and wise woodsmen build boats.'"

 "I wish," said I sincerely, "that there were fewer proverbs
    in Brittany."

 We were in sight of the forest now; across the gorse I could
    see the sparkle of gendarmes' trappings, and the glitter of Le
    Bihan's silver-buttoned jacket. The hedge was low and we took
    it without difficulty, and trotted across the moor to where Le
    Bihan and Durand stood gesticulating.

 They bowed ceremoniously to Lys as we rode up.

 "The trail is horrible—it is a river," said the mayor
    in his squeaky voice. "Monsieur Darrel, I think perhaps madame
    would scarcely care to come any nearer."

 Lys drew bridle and looked at me.

 "It is horrible!" said Durand, walking up beside me; "it
    looks as though a bleeding regiment had passed this way. The
    trail winds and winds about here in the thickets; we lose it at
    times, but we always find it again. I can't understand how one
    man—no, nor twenty—could bleed like that!"

 A halloo, answered by another, sounded from the depths of
    the forest.

 "It's my men; they are following the trail," muttered the
    brigadier. "God alone knows what is at the end!"

 "Shall we gallop back, Lys?" I asked.

 "No; let us ride along the western edge of the woods and
    dismount. The sun is so hot now, and I should like to rest for
    a moment," she said.

 "The western forest is clear of anything disagreeable," said
    Durand.

 "Very well," I answered; "call me, Le Bihan, if you find
    anything."

 Lys wheeled her mare, and I followed across the springy
    heather, Môme trotting cheerfully in the rear.

 We entered the sunny woods about a quarter of a kilometer
    from where we left Durand. I took Lys from her horse, flung
    both bridles over a limb, and, giving my wife my arm, aided her
    to a flat mossy rock which overhung a shallow brook gurgling
    among the beech trees. Lys sat down and drew off her gauntlets.
    Môme pushed his head into her lap, received an undeserved
    caress, and came doubtfully toward me. I was weak enough to
    condone his offense, but I made him lie down at my feet,
    greatly to his disgust.

 I rested my head on Lys's knees, looking up at the sky
    through the crossed branches of the trees.

 "I suppose I have killed him," I said. "It shocks me
    terribly, Lys."

 "You could not have known, dear. He may have been a robber,
    and—if—not—did—have you ever fired your
    revolver since that day four years ago when the Red Admiral's
    son tried to kill you? But I know you have not."

 "No," said I, wondering. "It's a fact, I have not. Why?"

 "And don't you remember that I asked you to let me load it
    for you the day when Yves went off, swearing to kill you and
    his father?"

 "Yes, I do remember. Well?"

 "Well, I—I took the cartridges first to St. Gildas
    chapel and dipped them in holy water. You must not laugh,
    Dick," said Lys gently, laying her cool hands on my lips.

 "Laugh, my darling!"

 Overhead the October sky was pale amethyst, and the sunlight
    burned like orange flame through the yellow leaves of beech and
    oak. Gnats and midges danced and wavered overhead; a spider
    dropped from a twig halfway to the ground and hung suspended on
    the end of his gossamer thread.

 "Are you sleepy, dear?" asked Lys, bending over me.

 "I am—a little; I scarcely slept two hours last
    night," I answered.

 "You may sleep, if you wish," said Lys, and touched my eyes
    caressingly.

 "Is my head heavy on your knees?"

 "No, Dick."

 I was already in a half doze; still I heard the brook
    babbling under the beeches and the humming of forest flies
    overhead. Presently even these were stilled.

 The next thing I knew I was sitting bolt upright, my ears
    ringing with a scream, and I saw Lys cowering beside me,
    covering her white face with both hands.

 As I sprang to my feet she cried again and clung to my
    knees. I saw my dog rush growling into a thicket, then I heard
    him whimper, and he came backing out, whining, ears flat, tail
    down. I stooped and disengaged Lys's hand.

 "Don't go, Dick!" she cried. "O God, it's the Black
    Priest!"

 In a moment I had leaped across the brook and pushed my way
    into the thicket. It was empty. I stared about me; I scanned
    every tree trunk, every bush. Suddenly I saw him. He was seated
    on a fallen log, his head resting in his hands, his rusty black
    robe gathered around him. For a moment my hair stirred under my
    cap; sweat started on forehead and cheek bone; then I recovered
    my reason, and understood that the man was human and was
    probably wounded to death. Ay, to death; for there at my feet,
    lay the wet trail of blood, over leaves and stones, down into
    the little hollow, across to the figure in black resting
    silently under the trees.

 I saw that he could not escape even if he had the strength,
    for before him, almost at his very feet, lay a deep, shining
    swamp.

 As I stepped forward my foot broke a twig. At the sound the
    figure started a little, then its head fell forward again. Its
    face was masked. Walking up to the man, I bade him tell where
    he was wounded. Durand and the others broke through the thicket
    at the same moment and hurried to my side.

 "Who are you who hide a masked face in a priest's robe?"
    said the gendarme loudly.

 There was no answer.

 "See—see the stiff blood all over his robe," muttered
    Le Bihan to Fortin.

 "He will not speak," said I.

 "He may be too badly wounded," whispered Le Bihan.

 "I saw him raise his head," I said, "my wife saw him creep
    up here."

 Durand stepped forward and touched the figure.

 "Speak!" he said.

 "Speak!" quavered Fortin.

 Durand waited a moment, then with a sudden upward movement
    he stripped off the mask and threw back the man's head. We were
    looking into the eye sockets of a skull. Durand stood rigid;
    the mayor shrieked. The skeleton burst out from its rotting
    robes and collapsed on the ground before us. From between the
    staring ribs and the grinning teeth spurted a torrent of black
    blood, showering the shrinking grasses; then the thing
    shuddered, and fell over into the black ooze of the bog. Little
    bubbles of iridescent air appeared from the mud; the bones were
    slowly engulfed, and, as the last fragments sank out of sight,
    up from the depths and along the bank crept a creature, shiny,
    shivering, quivering its wings.

 It was a death's-head moth.

  I wish I had time to tell you how Lys outgrew
    superstitions—for she never knew the truth about the
    affair, and she never will know, since she has promised not to
    read this book. I wish I might tell you about the king and his
    coronation, and how the coronation robe fitted. I wish that I
    were able to write how Yvonne and Herbert Stuart rode to a boar
    hunt in Quimperle, and how the hounds raced the quarry right
    through the town, overturning three gendarmes, the notary, and
    an old woman. But I am becoming garrulous and Lys is calling me
    to come and hear the king say that he is sleepy. And his
    highness shall not be kept waiting.

 THE KING'S CRADLE SONG

   Seal with a seal of gold

 The scroll of a life unrolled;

 Swathe him deep in his purple stole;

 Ashes of diamonds, crystalled coal,

 Drops of gold in each scented fold.



  Crimson wings of the Little Death,

 Stir his hair with your silken
            breath;

 Flaming wings of sins to be,

 Splendid pinions of prophecy,

 Smother his eyes with hues and dyes,

 While the white moon spins and the winds arise,

 And the stars drip through the skies.



  Wave, O wings of the Little Death!

 Seal his sight and stifle his breath,

 Cover his breast with the gemmed shroud
            pressed;

 From north to north, from west to
            west,

 Wave, O wings of the Little Death!

 Till the white moon reels in the cracking skies,

 And the ghosts of God arise.
