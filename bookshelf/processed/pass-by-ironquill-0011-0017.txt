came back to the door
again, and opening it, uttered, for the first time in our service, words
of apology and regret: "I hope I ha'n't put you out any. I wanted to
go with you, but I ought to knowed I couldn't. All is, I loved you too
much."

  PASS

 BY IRONQUILL

  A father said unto his hopeful son, 

 "Who was Leonidas, my cherished one?" 

 The boy replied, with words of ardent nature, 

 "He was a member of the legislature." 

 "How?" asked the parent; then the youngster saith: 

 "He got a pass, and held her like grim death." 

 "Whose pass? what pass?" the anxious father cried; 

 "'Twas the'r monopoly," the boy replied. 



 In deference to the public, we must state, 

 That boy has been an orphan since that date. 



  TEACHING BY EXAMPLE

 BY JOHN G. SAXE

  "What is the 'Poet's License,' say?" 

 Asked rose-lipped Anna of a poet. 

 "Now give me an example, pray, 

 That when I see one I may know it." 

 Quick as a flash he plants a kiss 

 Where perfect kisses always fall. 

 "Nay, sir! what liberty is this?" 

 "The Poet's License ,â€”that is all!"
