THE TWO AUTOMOBILISTS
BY CAROLYN WELLS
Once on a Time there were Two Young Men, each of whom Bought an
Automobile.
One Young Man, being of a Bold and Audacious nature, said:
"I will make my Machine go so Fast that I will break all Previous
Records."
Accordingly, he did So, and he Flew through the Small Town like a Red
Dragon Pursuing his Prey.
Unheeding all Obstacles in his Mad Career, his Automobile ran into a
Wall of Rock, and was dashed to Pieces. Also, the young Man was killed.
The Other Young Man, being of a Timorous and Careful Disposition,
started off with great Caution and Rode at a Slow Pace, pausing now and
then, Lest he might Run into Something.
The Result was, that Two Automobiles and an Ice Wagon ran into him from
behind, spoiling his Car and Killing the Cautious Young Man.
