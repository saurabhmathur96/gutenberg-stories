The pore 'ud git theyr dues some times— 

 Ef I only had my ruthers,— 

 And be paid dollars 'stid o' dimes , 

 Fer children, wives and mothers: 

 Theyr boy that slaves; theyr girl that sews— 

 Fer others —not herself, God knows!— 

 The grave's her only change of clothes! 

 ... Ef I only had my ruthers, 

 They'd all have "stuff" and time enugh 

 To answer one-another's 

 Appealin' prayer fer "lovin' care"— 

 Ef I only had my ruthers. 



 They'd be few folks 'ud ast fer trust, 

 Ef I only had my ruthers, 

 And blame few business-men to bu'st 

 Theyrselves, er harts of others: 

 Big Guns that come here durin' Fair- 

 Week could put up jest anywhare, 

 And find a full-and-plenty thare, 

 Ef I only had my ruthers: 

 The rich and great 'ud 'sociate 

 With all theyr lowly brothers, 

 Feelin' we done the honorun— 

 Ef I only had my ruthers.
