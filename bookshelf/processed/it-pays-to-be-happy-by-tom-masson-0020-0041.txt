IT PAYS TO BE HAPPY  BY TOM MASSON

  She is so gay, so very gay, 

 And not by fits and starts, 

 But ever, through each livelong day 

 She's sunshine to all hearts. 



 A tonic is her merry laugh! 

 So wondrous is her power 

 That listening grief would stop and chaff 

 With her from hour to hour. 



 Disease before that cheery smile 

 Grows dim, begins to fade. 

 A Christian scientist, meanwhile, 

 Is this delightful maid. 



 And who would not throw off dull care 

 And be like unto her, 

 When happiness brings, as her share, 

 One hundred dollars per ——?
