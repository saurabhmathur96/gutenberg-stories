THE COURTIN'

 BY JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL

  God makes sech nights, all white an' still 

 Fur 'z you can look or listen, 

 Moonshine an' snow on field an' hill, 

 All silence an' all glisten. 



 Zekle crep' up quite unbeknown 

 An' peeked in thru' the winder, 

 An' there sot Huldy all alone, 

 'Ith no one nigh to hender. 



 A fireplace filled the room's one side 

 With half a cord o' wood in— 

 There warn't no stoves (tell comfort died) 

 To bake ye to a puddin'. 



 The wa'nut logs shot sparkles out 

 Towards the pootiest, bless her, 

 An' leetle flames danced all about 

 The chiny on the dresser. 



 Agin the chimbley crook-necks hung, 

 An' in amongst 'em rusted 

 The old queen's-arm that Gran'ther Young 

 Fetched back f'om Concord busted. 



 The very room, coz she was in, 

 Seemed warm f'om floor to ceilin', 

 An' she looked full ez rosy agin 

 Ez the apples she was peelin'. 



 'T was kin' o' kingdom-come to look 

 On sech a blessed cretur; 

 A dogrose blushin' to a brook 

 Ain't modester nor sweeter. 



 He was six foot o' man, A 1, 

 Clear grit an' human natur'; 

 None couldn't quicker pitch a ton 

 Nor dror a furrer straighter. 



 He'd sparked it with full twenty gals, 

 He'd squired 'em, danced 'em, druv 'em, 

 Fust this one, an' then thet, by spells— 

 All is, he couldn't love 'em. 



 But long o' her his veins 'ould run 

 All crinkly like curled maple; 

 The side she breshed felt full o' sun 

 Ez a south slope in Ap'il. 



 She thought no v'ice bed sech a swing 

 Ez hisn in the choir; 

 My! when he made Ole Hundred ring, 

 She knowed the Lord was nigher. 



 An' she'd blush scarlit, right in prayer, 

 When her new meetin'-bunnet 

 Felt somehow thru its crown a pair 

 O' blue eyes sot upun it. 



 Thet night, I tell ye, she looked some ! 

 She seemed to 've gut a new soul 

 For she felt sartin-sure he'd come, 

 Down to her very shoe-sole. 



 She heered a foot, an' knowed it tu, 

 A-raspin' on the scraper— 

 All ways to once her feelin's flew 

 Like sparks in burnt-up paper. 



 He kin' o' l'itered on the mat, 

 Some doubtfle o' the sekle; 

 His heart kep' goin' pity-pat, 

 But hern went pity Zekle. 



 An' yit she gin her cheer a jerk 

 Ez though she wished him furder, 

 An' on her apples kep' to work, 

 Parin' away like murder. 



 "You want to see my Pa, I s'pose?" 

 "Wal ... no ... I come dasignin'—" 

 "To see my Ma? She's sprinklin' clo'es 

 Agin to-morrer's i'nin'." 



 To say why gals act so or so, 

 Or don't, 'ould be presumin'; 

 Mebby to mean yes an' say no 

 Comes nateral to women. 



 He stood a spell on one foot fust, 

 Then stood a spell on t' other, 

 An' on which one he felt the wust 

 He couldn't ha' told ye nuther. 



 Says he, "I'd better call agin"; 

 Says she, "Think likely, Mister"; 

 Thet last word pricked him like a pin, 

 An' ... Wal, he up an' kist her. 



 When Ma bimeby upon 'em slips, 

 Huldy sot pale ez ashes, 

 All kin' o' smily roun' the lips 

 An' teary roun' the lashes. 



 For she was jes' the quiet kind 

 Whose naturs never vary, 

 Like streams that keep a summer mind 

 Snowhid in Jenooary. 



 The blood clost roun' her heart felt glued 

 Too tight for all expressin', 

 Tell mother see how metters stood, 

 An' gin 'em both her blessin'. 



 Then her red come back like the tide 

 Down to the Bay o' Fundy, 

 An' all I know is they was cried 

 In meetin' come nex' Sunday.
