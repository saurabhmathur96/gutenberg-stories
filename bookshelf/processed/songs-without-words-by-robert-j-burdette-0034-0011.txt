SONGS WITHOUT WORDS

 BY ROBERT J. BURDETTE

  I can not sing the old songs, 

 Though well I know the tune, 

 Familiar as a cradle song 

 With sleep-compelling croon; 

 Yet though I'm filled with music 

 As choirs of summer birds, 

 "I can not sing the old songs"— 

 I do not know the words. 



 I start on "Hail Columbia," 

 And get to "heav'n-born band," 

 And there I strike an up-grade 

 With neither steam nor sand; 

 "Star Spangled Banner" downs me 

 Right in my wildest screaming, 

 I start all right, but dumbly come 

 To voiceless wreck at "streaming." 



 So, when I sing the old songs, 

 Don't murmur or complain 

 If "Ti, diddy ah da, tum dum," 

 Should fill the sweetest strain. 

 I love "Tolly um dum di do," 

 And the "trilla-la yeep da"-birds, 

 But "I can not sing the old songs"— 

 I do not know the words.
