TALK

 BY JOHN PAUL

  It seems to me that talk should be, 

 Like water, sprinkled sparingly; 

 Then ground that late lay dull and dried 

 Smiles up at you revivified, 

 And flowers—of speech—touched by the dew 

 Put forth fresh root and bud anew. 

 But I'm not sure that any flower 

 Would thrive beneath Niagara's shower! 

 So when a friend turns full on me 

 His verbal hose, may I not flee? 

 I know that I am arid ground, 

 But I'm not watered—Gad! I'm drowned!
