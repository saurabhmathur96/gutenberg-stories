AN EDUCATIONAL PROJECT

 BY ROY FARRELL GREENE

  Since schools to teach one this or that 

 Are being started every day, 

 I have the plan, a notion pat, 

 Of one which I am sure would pay. 

 'Twould be a venture strictly new, 

 No shaking up of dusty bones; 

 How does the scheme appeal to you? 

 A regular school for chaperones! 



 One course would be to dull the ear, 

 And one would be to dim the eye, 

 So whispered love they'd never hear, 

 And glance coquettish never spy; 

 They'd be taught somnolence, and how 

 Ofttimes closed eye for sleep atones; 

 Had I a million, I'd endow 

 A regular school for chaperones! 



 There's crying need in West and East 

 For graduates, and not a source 

 Supplying it. Some one at least 

 Should start a correspondence course; 

 But joy will scarce o'errun the cup 

 Of maidenhood, my candor owns, 

 Till some skilled Mentor opens up 

 A regular school for chaperones!
