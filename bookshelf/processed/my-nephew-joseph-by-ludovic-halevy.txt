MY NEPHEW JOSEPH By Ludovic Halevy
    

      (Scene passes at Versailles; two old gentlemen are conversing, seated
      on a bench in the King’s garden.)
    

      Journalism, my dear Monsieur, is the evil of the times. I tell you what,
      if I had a son, I would hesitate a long while before giving him a literary
      education. I would have him learn chemistry, mathematics, fencing,
      cosmography, swimming, drawing, but not composition—no, not
      composition. Then, at least, he would be prevented from becoming a
      journalist. It is so easy, so tempting. They take pen and paper and write,
      it doesn’t matter what, apropos to it doesn’t matter what, and
      you have a newspaper article. In order to become a watchmaker, a lawyer,
      an upholsterer, in short, all the liberal arts, study, application, and a
      special kind of knowledge are necessary; but nothing like that is required
      for a journalist.”
    

      “You are perfectly right, my dear Monsieur, the profession of
      journalism should be restricted by examinations, the issuing of warrants,
      the granting of licenses—”
    

      “And they could pay well for their licenses, these gentlemen. Do you
      know that journalism is become very profitable? There are some young men
      in it who, all at once, without a fixed salary, and no capital whatever,
      make from ten, twenty to thirty thousand francs a year.”
    

      “Now, that is strange! But how do they become journalists?”
    

      “Ah! It appears they generally commence by being reporters.
      Reporters slip in everywhere, in official gatherings, and theatres, never
      missing a first night, nor a fire, nor a great ball, nor a murder.”
    

      “How well acquainted you are with all this!”
    

      “Yes, very well acquainted. Ah! Mon Dieu! You are my friend, you
      will keep my secret, and if you will not repeat this in Versailles—I
      will tell you how it is—we have one in the family.”
    

      “One what?”
    

      “A reporter.”
    

      “A reporter in your family, which always seemed so united! How can
      that be?”
    

      “One can almost say that the devil was at the bottom of it. You know
      my nephew Joseph—”
    

      “Little Joseph! Is he a reporter?”
    

      “Yes.”
    

      “Little Joseph, I can see him in the park now, rolling a hoop,
      bare-legged, with a broad white collar, not more than six or seven years
      ago—and now he writes for newspapers!”
    

      “Yes, newspapers! You know my brother keeps a pharmacy in the Rue
      Montorgueil, an old and reliable firm, and naturally my brother said to
      himself, ‘After me, my son.’ Joseph worked hard at chemistry,
      followed the course of study, and had already passed an examination. The
      boy was steady and industrious, and had a taste for the business. On
      Sundays for recreation he made tinctures, prepared prescriptions, pasted
      the labels and rolled pills. When, as misfortune would have it, a murder
      was committed about twenty feet from my brother’s pharmacy—”
    

      “The murder of the Rue Montorgueil—that clerk who killed his
      sweetheart, a little brewery maid?”
    

      “The very same. Joseph was attracted by the cries, saw the murderer
      arrested, and after the police were gone stayed there in the street,
      talking and jabbering. The Saturday before, Joseph had a game of billiards
      with the murderer.”
    

      “With the murderer!”
    

      “Oh! accidentally—he knew him by sight, went to the same cafÃ©,
      that’s all, and they had played at pool together, Joseph and the
      murderer—a man named Nicot. Joseph told this to the crowd, and you
      may well imagine how important that made him, when suddenly a little blond
      man seized him. ‘You know the murderer?’ ‘A little, not
      much; I played pool with him.’ ‘And do you know the motive of
      the crime?’ ‘It was love, Monsieur, love; Nicot had met a
      girl, named EugÃ©nie—’ ‘You knew the victim, too?’
      ‘Only by sight, she was there in the cafÃ© the night we played.’
      ‘Very well; but don’t tell that to anybody; come, come, quick.’
      He took possession of Joseph and made him get into a cab, which went
      rolling off at great speed down the Boulevard des Italiens. Ten minutes
      after, Joseph found himself in a hall where there was a big table, around
      which five or six young men were writing. ‘Here is a fine sensation,’
      said the little blond on entering. âThe best kind of a murder! a murder
      for love, in the Rue Montorgueil, and I have here the murderer’s
      most intimate friend.’ ‘No, not at all,’ cried Joseph,
      ‘I scarcely know him.’ ‘Be still,’ whispered the
      little blond to Joseph; then he continued, ‘Yes, his most intimate
      friend. They were brought up together, and a quarter of an hour before the
      crime was committed were playing billiards. The murderer won, he was
      perfectly calm——’ ‘That’s not it, it was
      last Saturday that I played with——’ ‘Be still,
      will you! A quarter of an hour, it is more to the point. Let’s go.
      Come, come.’ He took Joseph into a small room where they were alone,
      and said to him: ‘That affair ought to make about a hundred lines—you
      talk—I’ll write—there will be twenty francs for you.’
      ‘Twenty francs!’ âYes, and here they are in advance; but be
      quick, to business!’ Joseph told all he knew to the gentleman—how
      an old and retired Colonel, who lived in the house where the murder was
      committed, was the first to hear the victim’s cries; but he was
      paralyzed in both limbs, this old Colonel, and could only ring for the
      servant, an old cuirassier, who arrested the assassin. In short, with all
      the information concerning the game of billiards, EugÃ©nie and the
      paralytic old Colonel, the man composed his little article, and sent
      Joseph away with twenty francs. Do you think it ended there?”
    

      “I don’t think anything—I am amazed! Little Joseph a
      reporter!”
    

      “Hardly had Joseph stepped outside, when another man seized him—a
      tall, dark fellow. ‘I’ve been watching for you,’ he said
      to Joseph. ‘You were present when the murder was committed in the
      Rue Montorgueil!’ ‘Why, no, I was not present——’
      ‘That will do. I am well informed, come.’ ‘Where to?’
      âTo my newspaper office.’ ‘What for?’ ‘To tell me
      about the murder.’ ‘But I’ve already told all I know,
      there, in that house.’ ‘Come, you will still remember a few
      more little incidents—and I will give you twenty francs.’
      âTwenty francs!’ ‘Come, come.’ Another hall, another
      table, more young men writing, and again Joseph was interrogated. He
      recommenced the history of the old Colonel. ‘Is that what you told
      them down there?’ inquired the tall, dark man of Joseph. ‘Yes,
      Monsieur.’ ‘That needs some revision, then.’ And the
      tall, dark man made up a long story. How this old Colonel had been
      paralyzed for fourteen years, but on hearing the victim’s
      heartrending screams, received such a shock that all at once, as if by a
      miracle, had recovered the use of his legs; and it was he who had started
      out in pursuit of the murderer and had him arrested.
    

      “While dashing this off with one stroke of his pen, the man
      exclaimed: âGood! this is perfect! a hundred times better than the other
      account.’ âYes,’ said Joseph, ‘but it is not true.’
      ‘Not true for you, because you are acquainted with the affair; but
      for our hundred thousand readers, who do not know about it, it will be
      true enough. They were not there, those hundred thousand readers. What do
      they want? A striking account—well! they shall have it!’ And
      thereupon he discharged Joseph, who went home with his forty francs, and
      who naturally did not boast of his escapade. It is only of late that he
      has acknowledged it. However, from that day Joseph has shown less interest
      in the pharmacy. He bought a number of penny papers, and shut himself up
      in his room to write—no one knows what. At last he wore a
      business-like aspect, which was very funny. About six months ago I went to
      Paris to collect the dividends on my Northern stock.”
    

      “The Northern is doing very well; it went up this week——”
    

      “Oh! it’s good stock. Well, I had collected my dividends and
      had left the Northern Railway Station. It was beautiful weather, so I
      walked slowly down the Rue Lafayette. (I have a habit of strolling a
      little in Paris after I have collected my dividends.) When at the corner
      of the Faubourg Montmartre, whom should I see but my nephew, Joseph, all
      alone in a victoria, playing the fine gentleman. I saw very well that he
      turned his head away, the vagabond! But I overtook the carriage and
      stopped the driver. ‘What are you doing there?’ ‘A
      little drive, uncle.’ ‘Wait, I will go with you,’ and in
      I climbed. ‘Hurry up,’ said the driver, ‘or I’ll
      lose the trail.’ ‘What trail?’ ‘Why, the two cabs
      we are following.’ The man drove at a furious rate, and I asked
      Joseph why he was there in that victoria, following two cabs. ‘Mon
      Dieu, uncle,’ he replied, ‘there was a foreigner, a Spaniard,
      who came to our place in the Rue Montorgueil and bought a large amount of
      drugs, and has not paid us, so I am going after him to find out if he has
      not given us a wrong address.’ ‘And that Spaniard is in both
      the cabs?’ ‘No, uncle, he is only in one, the first.’
      âAnd who is in the second?’ ‘I don’t know, probably
      another creditor, like myself, in pursuit of the Spaniard.’ ‘Well,
      I am going to stay with you; I have two hours to myself before the train
      leaves at five o’clock and I adore this sort of thing, riding around
      Paris in an open carriage. Let’s follow the Spaniard!’ And
      then the chase commenced, down the boulevards, across the squares, through
      the streets, the three drivers cracking their whips and urging their
      horses on. This man-hunt began to get exciting. It recalled to my mind the
      romances in the Petit Journal. Finally, in a little street, belonging to
      the Temple Quarter, the first cab stopped.”
    

      “The Spaniard?”
    

      “Yes. A man got out of it—he had a large hat drawn down over
      his eyes and a big muffler wrapped about his neck. Presently three
      gentlemen, who had jumped from the second cab, rushed upon that man. I
      wanted to do the same, but Joseph tried to prevent me. ‘Don’t
      stir, uncle!’ ‘Why not? But they are going to deprive us of
      the Spaniard!’ And I dashed forward. ‘Take care, uncle, don’t
      be mixed up in that affair.’ But I was already gone. When I arrived
      they were putting the handcuffs on the Spaniard. I broke through the crowd
      which had collected, and cried, ‘Wait, Messieurs, wait; I also
      demand a settlement with this man.’ They made way for me. ‘You
      know this man?’ asked one of the gentlemen from the second cab, a
      short, stout fellow. ‘Perfectly; he is a Spaniard.’ ‘I a
      Spaniard!’ ‘Yes, a Spaniard.’ âGood,’ said the
      short, stout man, ‘Here’s the witness!’ and, addressing
      himself to one of the men, ‘Take Monsieur to the Prefecture
      immediately.’ âBut I have not the time; I live in Versailles; my
      wife expects me by the five o’clock train, and we have company to
      dinner, and I must take home a pie. I will come back to-morrow at any hour
      you wish.’ ‘No remarks,’ said the short, stout man,
      ‘but be off; I am the Police Commissioner.’ ‘But,
      Monsieur the Commissioner, I know nothing about it; it is my nephew Joseph
      who will tell you,’ and I called ‘Joseph! Joseph!’ but
      no Joseph came.”
    

      “He had decamped?”
    

      “With the victoria. They packed me in one of the two cabs with the
      detective, a charming man and very distinguished. Arriving at the
      Prefecture, they deposited me in a small apartment filled with vagabonds,
      criminals, and low, ignorant people. An hour after they came for me in
      order to bring me up for examination.”
    

      “You were brought up for examination?”
    

      “Yes, my dear Monsieur, I was. A policeman conducted me through the
      Palais de Justice, before the magistrate, a lean man, who asked me my name
      and address. I replied that I lived in Versailles, and that I had company
      to dinner; he interrupted me, ‘You know the prisoner?’
      pointing to the man with the muffler, ‘Speak up.’ But he
      questioned me so threateningly that I became disconcerted, for I felt that
      he was passing judgment upon me. Then in my embarrassment the words did
      not come quickly. I finished, moreover, by telling him that I knew the man
      without knowing him; then he became furious: ‘What’s that you
      say? You know a man without knowing him! At least explain yourself!’
      I was all of a tremble, and said that I knew he was a Spaniard, but the
      man replied that he was not a Spaniard. ‘Well, well,’ said the
      Judge. ‘Denial, always denial; it is your way.’ ‘I tell
      you that my name is Rigaud, and that I was born in Josey, in Josas; they
      are not Spaniards that are born in Josey, in Josas.’ ‘Always
      contradiction; very good, very good!’ And the Judge addressed
      himself to me. ‘Then this man is a Spaniard?’ ‘Yes,
      Monsieur the Judge, so I have been told.’ ‘Do you know
      anything more about him?’ ‘I know he made purchases at my
      brother’s pharmacy in the Rue Montorgueil.’ ‘At a
      pharmacy! and he bought, did he not, some chlorate of potash, azotite of
      potash, and sulphur powder; in a word, materials to manufacture
      explosives.’ ‘I don’t know what he bought. I only know
      that he did not pay, that’s all.’ ‘Parbleau! Anarchists
      never pay—’ ‘I did not need to pay. I never bought
      chlorate of potash in the Rue Montorgueil,’ cried the man; but the
      Judge exclaimed, louder still, ‘Yes, it is your audacious habit of
      lying, but I will sift this matter to the bottom; sift it, do you
      understand. And now why is that muffler on in the month of May?’
      ‘I have a cold,’ replied the other. ‘Haven’t I the
      right to have a cold?’ ‘That is very suspicious, very
      suspicious. I am going to send for the druggist in the Rue Montorgueil!’”
    

      “Then they sent for your brother?”
    

      “Yes; I wanted to leave, tried to explain to the Judge that my wife
      was expecting me in Versailles, that I had already missed the five o’clock
      train, that I had company to dinner, and must bring home a pie. ‘You
      shall not go,’ replied the Judge, ‘and cease to annoy me with
      your dinner and your pie; I will need you for a second examination. The
      affair is of the gravest sort.’ I tried to resist, but they led me
      away somewhat roughly, and thrust me again into the little apartment with
      the criminals. After waiting an hour I was brought up for another
      examination. My brother was there. But we could not exchange two words,
      for he entered the courtroom by one door and I by another. All this was
      arranged perfectly. The man with the muffler was again brought out. The
      Judge addressed my brother. âDo you recognize the prisoner?’ ‘No.’
      ‘Ah! you see he does not know me!’ âBe silent!’ said the
      Judge, and he continued talking excitedly: ‘You know the man?’
      ‘Certainly not.’ ‘Think well; you ought to know him.’
      ‘I tell you, no.’ ‘I tell you, yes, and that he bought
      some chlorate of potash from you.’ ‘No!’ ‘Ah!’
      cried the Judge, in a passion. ‘Take care, weigh well your words;
      you are treading on dangerous ground.’ ‘I!’ exclaimed my
      brother. ‘Yes, for there is your brother; you recognize him, I
      think.’ âYes, I recognize him.’ ‘That is fortunate.
      Well, your brother there says that man owes you money for having bought at
      your establishment—I specify—materials to manufacture
      explosives.’ ‘But you did not say that.’ âNo, I wish to
      re-establish the facts.’ But that Judge would give no one a chance
      to speak. ‘Don’t interrupt me. Who is conducting this
      examination, you or I?’ ‘You, Monsieur the Judge?’
      ‘Well, at all events, you said the prisoner owed your brother some
      money.’ ‘That I acknowledge.’ ‘But who told you
      all this?’ asked my brother. ‘Your son, Joseph!’ ‘Joseph!’
      ‘He followed the man for the sake of the money, which he owed you
      for the drugs.’ ‘I understand nothing of all this,’ said
      my brother; ‘Neither do I,’ said the man with the muffler;
      ‘Neither do I,’ I repeated in my turn; âNeither do I any more,’
      cried the Judge; ‘Or rather, yes, there is something that I
      understand very well; we have captured a gang, all these men understand
      one another, and side with one another; they are a band of Anarchists!’
      ‘That is putting it too strong,’ I protested to the Judge, âI,
      a landowner, an Anarchist! Can a man be an Anarchist when he owns a house
      on the Boulevard de la Reine at Versailles and a cottage at Houlgate,
      Calvados? These are facts.’”
    

      “That was well answered.”
    

      “But this Judge would not listen to anything. He said to my brother,
      âWhere does your son live?’ ‘With me in the Rue Montorgueil.’
      ‘Well, he must be sent for; and in the meanwhile, these two brothers
      are to be placed in separate cells.’ Then, losing patience, I cried
      that this was infamy! But I felt myself seized and dragged through the
      corridors and locked in a little box four feet square. In there I passed
      three hours.”
    

      “Didn’t they find your nephew Joseph?”
    

      “No, it was not that. It was the Judge. He went off to his dinner,
      and took his time about it! Finally, at midnight, they had another
      examination. Behold all four of us before the Judge! The man with the
      muffler, myself, my brother and Joseph. The Judge began, addressing my
      nephew: ‘This man is indeed your father?’ ‘Yes.’
      ‘This man is indeed your uncle?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘And
      that man is indeed the Spaniard who purchased some chlorate of potash from
      you?’ ‘No.’ ‘What! No?’ ‘There,’
      exclaimed the fellow with the muffler. ‘You can see now that these
      men do not know me.’ âYes, yes,’ answered the Judge, not at
      all disconcerted. ‘Denial again! Let’s see, young man, did you
      not say to your uncle——’ ‘Yes, Monsieur the Judge,
      that is true.’ ‘Ah! the truth! Here is the truth!’
      exclaimed the Judge, triumphantly. ‘Yes, I told my uncle that the
      man purchased drugs from us, but that is not so.’ ‘Why isn’t
      it?’ ‘Wait, I will tell you. Unknown to my family I am a
      journalist.’ ‘Journalist! My son a journalist! Don’t
      believe that, Monsieur the Judge, my son is an apprentice in a pharmacy.’
      ‘Yes, my nephew is an apprentice in a pharmacy,’ I echoed.
      ‘These men contradict themselves; this is a gang, decidedly a gang—are
      you a journalist, young man, or an apprentice in a pharmacy?’
      ‘I am both.’ ‘That is a lie!’ cried my brother,
      now thoroughly angry. ‘And for what newspaper do you write?’
      ‘For no paper at all,’ replied my brother, ‘I know that,
      for he is not capable.’ ‘I do not exactly write, Monsieur the
      Judge; I procure information; I am a reporter.’ ‘Reporter! My
      son a reporter? What’s that he says?’ ‘Will you be
      still!’ cried the Judge. For what newspaper are you a reporter?’
      Joseph told the name of the paper. ‘Well,’ resumed the Judge,
      ‘we must send for the chief editor immediately—immediately, he
      must be awakened and brought here. I will pass the night at court. I’ve
      discovered a great conspiracy. Lead these men away and keep them apart.’
      The Judge beamed, for he already saw himself Court Counsellor. They
      brought us back, and I assure you I no longer knew where I was. I came and
      went up and down the staircases and through the corridors. If anyone had
      asked me at the time if I were an accomplice of Ravachol, I would have
      answered, ‘Probably.’”
    

      “When did all this take place?”
    

      “One o’clock in the morning; and the fourth examination did
      not take place until two. But, thank Heaven! in five minutes it was all
      made clear. The editor of the newspaper arrived, and burst into a hearty
      laugh when he learned of the condition of affairs; and this is what he
      told the Judge. My nephew had given them the particulars of a murder, and
      had been recompensed for it, and then the young man had acquired a taste
      for that occupation, and had come to apply for the situation. They had
      found him clear-headed, bold, and intelligent, and had sent him to take
      notes at the executions, at fires, etc., and the morning after the editor
      had a good idea. ‘The detectives were on the lookout for Anarchists,
      so I sent my reporters on the heels of each detective, and in this way I
      would be the first to hear of all the arrests. Now, you see, it all
      explains itself; the detective followed an Anarchist.’”
    

      “And your nephew Joseph followed the detective?”
    

      “Yes, but he dared not tell the truth, so he told me he was one of
      papa’s debtors.’ The man with the muffler was triumphant.
      ‘Am I still a Spaniard?’ ‘No, well and good,’
      replied the Judge. ‘But an Anarchist is another thing.’ And in
      truth he was; but he only held one, that Judge, and was so vexed because
      he believed he had caught a whole gang, and was obliged to discharge us at
      four o’clock in the morning. I had to take a carriage to return to
      Versailles—got one for thirty francs. But found my poor wife in such
      a state!”
    

      “And your nephew still clings to journalism?”
    

      “Yes, and makes money for nothing but to ride about Paris that way
      in a cab, and to the country in the railway trains. The newspaper men are
      satisfied with him.”
    

      “What does your brother say to all this?”
    

      “He began by turning him out of doors. But when he knew that some
      months he made two and three hundred francs, he softened; and then Joseph
      is as cute as a monkey. You know my brother invented a cough lozenge,
      âDervishes’ lozenges’?”
    

      “Yes, you gave me a box of them.”
    

      “Ah! so I did. Well, Joseph found means to introduce into the
      account of a murderer’s arrest an advertisement of his father’s
      lozenges.”—“How did he do it?”
    

      “He told how the murderer was hidden in a panel, and that he could
      not be found. But having the influenza, had sneezed, and that had been the
      means of his capture. And Joseph added that this would not have happened
      to him had he taken the Dervishes Lozenges. You see that pleased my
      brother so much that he forgave him. Ah! there is my wife coming to look
      for me. Not a word of all this! It is not necessary to repeat that there
      is a reporter in the family, and there is another reason for not telling
      it. When I want to sell off to the people of Versailles, I go and find
      Joseph and tell him of my little plan. He arranges everything for me as it
      should be, puts it in the paper quietly, and they don’t know how it
      comes there!”
