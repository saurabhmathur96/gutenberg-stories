THE TWO FARMERS
BY CAROLYN WELLS
Once on a Time there were Two Farmers who wished to Sell their Farms.
To One came a Buyer who offered a Fair Price, but the Farmer refused to
Sell, saying he had heard rumors of a Railroad which was to be Built in
his Vicinity, and he hoped The Corporation would buy his Farm at a Large
Figure.
The Buyer therefore went Away, and as the Railroad never Materialized,
the Farmer Sorely Regretted that he lost a Good Chance.
The Other Farmer Sold his Farm to the First Customer who came Along,
although he Received but a Small Price for it. Soon Afterward a Railroad
was Built right through the Same Farm, and The Railroad Company paid an
Enormous Sum for the Land.
MORALS:
This Fable teaches that a Bird In The Hand is worth Two In The Bush, and
The Patient Waiter Is No Loser.
