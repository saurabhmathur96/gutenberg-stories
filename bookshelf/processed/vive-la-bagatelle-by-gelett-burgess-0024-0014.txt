VIVE LA BAGATELLE

 BY GELETT BURGESS

  Sing a song of foolishness, laughing stocks and cranks! 

 The more there are the merrier; come join the ranks! 

 Life is dry and stupid; whoop her up a bit! 

 Donkeys live in clover; bray and throw a fit! 



 Take yourself in earnest, never stop to think, 

 Strut and swagger boldly, dress in red and pink; 

 Prate of stuff and nonsense, get yourself abused; 

 Some one's got to play the fool to keep the crowd amused! 



 Bully for the idiot! Bully for the guy! 

 You could be a prig yourself, if you would only try! 

 Altruistic asses keep the fun alive; 

 Clowns are growing scarcer; hurry and arrive! 



 I seen a crazy critic a-writin' of a screed; 

 "Tendencies" and "Unities"â€”Maeterlinck indeed! 

 He wore a paper collar, and his tie was up behind; 

 If that's the test of Culture, then I'm glad I'm not refined! 



 Let me laugh at you, then you can laugh at me; 

 Then we'll josh together everything we see; 

 Every one's a nincompoop to another's view; 

 Laughter makes the sun shine! Roop-de-doodle-doo!
