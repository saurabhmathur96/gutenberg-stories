THE TWO PRISONERS

 BY CAROLYN WELLS

 Once upon a time there were two Prisoners at the bar, who endeavored to
plead for themselves with Tact and Wisdom.

 One concealed certain Facts prejudicial to his Cause; upon which the
Judge said: "If you had Confessed the Truth it would have Biased me in
your Favor; as it is, I Condemn you to Punishment."

 The other stated his Case with absolute Truth and Sincerity, concealing
Nothing; and the result was that he was Condemned for his Misdemeanors.

 MORALS:

 This Fable teaches that Honesty is the Best Policy, and that the Truth
should not Be spoken at All Times.
