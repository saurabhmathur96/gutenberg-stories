A street-car strike in Omaha has cumulative shocks— 

 It boosted huckleberries up to twenty cents a box. 

 No matter what is happening it always finds your door— 

 Give us a rest! Let nothing ever happen any more. 



 Mosquitoes in New Jersey bite a magnate on the wing— 

 Result: the poor consumer feels that fierce mosquito's sting: 

 The skeeter's song is silenced, but in something like an hour 

 The grocers understand that it requires a raise in flour. 

 A house burns down in Texas and a stove blows up in Maine, 

 Ten minutes later breakfast foods in prices show a gain. 

 Effects must follow causes—which is what I most deplore; 

 I hope and pray that nothing ever happens any more. 



  A DISAPPOINTMENT

 BY JOHN BOYLE O'REILLY

  Her hair was a waving bronze, and her eyes 

 Deep wells that might cover a brooding soul; 

 And who, till he weighed it, could ever surmise 

 That her heart was a cinder instead of a coal!
