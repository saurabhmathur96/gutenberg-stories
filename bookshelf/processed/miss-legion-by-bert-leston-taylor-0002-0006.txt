MISS LEGION

 By Bert Leston Taylor

  She is hotfoot after Cultyure; 

 She pursues it with a club. 

 She breathes a heavy atmosphere 

 Of literary flub. 

 No literary shrine so far 

 But she is there to kneel; 

 And— 

 Her favorite bunch of reading 

 Is O. Meredith's "Lucile." 



 Of course she's up on pictures— 

 Passes for a connoisseur; 

 On free days at the Institute 

 You'll always notice her. 

 She qualifies approval 

 Of a Titian or Corot, 

 But— 

 She throws a fit of rapture 

 When she comes to Bouguereau. 



 And when you talk of music, 

 Why, she's Music's devotee. 

 She will tell you that Beethoven 

 Always makes her wish to pray, 

 And "dear old Bach!" his very name, 

 She says, her ear enchants; 

 But— 

 Her favorite piece is Weber's 

 "Invitation to the Dance."
