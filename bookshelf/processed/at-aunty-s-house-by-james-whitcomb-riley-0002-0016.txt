AT AUNTY'S HOUSE

 By James Whitcomb Riley

  One time, when we'z at Aunty's house— 

 'Way in the country!—where 

 They's ist but woods—an' pigs, an' cows— 

 An' all's out-doors an' air!— 

 An' orchurd-swing; an' churry-trees— 

 An' churries in 'em!—Yes, an' these- 

 Here red-head birds steals all they please, 

 An' tetch 'em ef you dare!— 

 W'y, wunst, one time, when we wuz there, 

 We et out on the porch ! 



 Wite where the cellar-door wuz shut 

 The table wuz; an' I 

 Let Aunty set by me an' cut 

 My vittuls up—an' pie. 

 'Tuz awful funny!—I could see 

 The red-heads in the churry-tree; 

 An' bee-hives, where you got to be 

 So keerful, goin' by;— 

 An' "Comp'ny" there an' all!—an' we— 

 We et out on the porch ! 



 An' I ist et p'surves an' things 

 'At Ma don't 'low me to— 

 An' chickun-gizzurds —(don't like wings 

 Like Parunts does! do you ?) 

 An' all the time, the wind blowed there, 

 An' I could feel it in my hair,



 An' ist smell clover ever 'where!— 

 An' a' old red-head flew 

 Purt' nigh wite over my high-chair, 

 When we et on the porch !
