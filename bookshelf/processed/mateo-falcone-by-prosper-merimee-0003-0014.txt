MATEO FALCONE By Prosper Merimee
    

      On leaving Porto-Vecchio from the northwest and directing his steps
      towards the interior of the island, the traveller will notice that the
      land rises rapidly, and after three hours’ walking over tortuous
      paths obstructed by great masses of rock and sometimes cut by ravines, he
      will find himself on the border of a great mÃ¢quis. The mÃ¢quis is the
      domain of the Corsican shepherds and of those who are at variance with
      justice. It must be known that, in order to save himself the trouble of
      manuring his field, the Corsican husbandman sets fire to a piece of
      woodland. If the flame spread farther than is necessary, so much the
      worse! In any case he is certain of a good crop from the land fertilized
      by the ashes of the trees which grow upon it. He gathers only the heads of
      his grain, leaving the straw, which it would be unnecessary labor to cut.
      In the following spring the roots that have remained in the earth without
      being destroyed send up their tufts of sprouts, which in a few years reach
      a height of seven or eight feet. It is this kind of tangled thicket that
      is called a mÃ¢quis. They are made up of different kinds of trees and
      shrubs, so crowded and mingled together at the caprice of nature that only
      with an axe in hand can a man open a passage through them, and mÃ¢quis are
      frequently seen so thick and bushy that the wild sheep themselves cannot
      penetrate them.
    

      If you have killed a man, go into the mÃ¢quis of Porto-Vecchio. With a good
      gun and plenty of powder and balls, you can live there in safety. Do not
      forget a brown cloak furnished with a hood, which will serve you for both
      cover and mattress. The shepherds will give you chestnuts, milk and
      cheese, and you will have nothing to fear from justice nor the relatives
      of the dead except when it is necessary for you to descend to the city to
      replenish your ammunition.
    

      When I was in Corsica in 18—, Mateo Falcone had his house half a
      league from this mÃ¢quis. He was rich enough for that country, living in
      noble style—that is to say, doing nothing—on the income from
      his flocks, which the shepherds, who are a kind of nomads, lead to pasture
      here and there on the mountains. When I saw him, two years after the event
      that I am about to relate, he appeared to me to be about fifty years old
      or more. Picture to yourself a man, small but robust, with curly hair,
      black as jet, an aquiline nose, thin lips, large, restless eyes, and a
      complexion the color of tanned leather. His skill as a marksman was
      considered extraordinary even in his country, where good shots are so
      common. For example, Mateo would never fire at a sheep with buckshot; but
      at a hundred and twenty paces, he would drop it with a ball in the head or
      shoulder, as he chose. He used his arms as easily at night as during the
      day. I was told this feat of his skill, which will, perhaps, seem
      impossible to those who have not travelled in Corsica. A lighted candle
      was placed at eighty paces, behind a paper transparency about the size of
      a plate. He would take aim, then the candle would be extinguished, and, at
      the end of a moment, in the most complete darkness, he would fire and hit
      the paper three times out of four.
    

      With such a transcendent accomplishment, Mateo Falcone had acquired a
      great reputation. He was said to be as good a friend as he was a dangerous
      enemy; accommodating and charitable, he lived at peace with all the world
      in the district of Porto-Vecchio. But it is said of him that in Corte,
      where he had married his wife, he had disembarrassed himself very
      vigorously of a rival who was considered as redoubtable in war as in love;
      at least, a certain gun-shot which surprised this rival as he was shaving
      before a little mirror hung in his window was attributed to Mateo. The
      affair was smoothed over and Mateo was married. His wife Giuseppa had
      given him at first three daughters (which infuriated him), and finally a
      son, whom he named Fortunato, and who became the hope of his family, the
      inheritor of the name. The daughters were well married: their father could
      count at need on the poignards and carbines of his sons-in-law. The son
      was only ten years old, but he already gave promise of fine attributes.
    

      On a certain day in autumn, Mateo set out at an early hour with his wife
      to visit one of his flocks in a clearing of the mÃ¢quis. The little
      Fortunato wanted to go with them, but the clearing was too far away;
      moreover, it was necessary some one should stay to watch the house;
      therefore the father refused: it will be seen whether or not he had reason
      to repent.
    

      He had been gone some hours, and the little Fortunato was tranquilly
      stretched out in the sun, looking at the blue mountains, and thinking that
      the next Sunday he was going to dine in the city with his uncle, the
      Caporal [Note: Civic Official], when he was suddenly interrupted in his
      meditations by the firing of a musket. He got up and turned to that side
      of the plain whence the noise came. Other shots followed, fired at
      irregular intervals, and each time nearer; at last, in the path which led
      from the plain to Mateo’s house, appeared a man wearing the pointed
      hat of the mountaineers, bearded, covered with rags, and dragging himself
      along with difficulty by the support of his gun. He had just received a
      wound in his thigh.
    

      This man was an outlaw, who, having gone to the town by night to buy
      powder, had fallen on the way into an ambuscade of Corsican
      light-infantry. After a vigorous defense he was fortunate in making his
      retreat, closely followed and firing from rock to rock. But he was only a
      little in advance of the soldiers, and his wound prevented him from
      gaining the mÃ¢quis before being overtaken.
    

      He approached Fortunato and said: “You are the son of Mateo Falcone?”—“Yes.”
    

      “I am Gianetto Saupiero. I am followed by the yellow-collars [Note:
      Slang for Gendarmes.]. Hide me, for I can go no farther.”
    

      “And what will my father say if I hide you without his permission?”
    

      “He will say that you have done well.”
    

      “How do you know?”
    

      “Hide me quickly; they are coming.”
    

      “Wait till my father gets back.”
    

      “How can I wait? Malediction! They will be here in five minutes.
      Come, hide me, or I will kill you.”
    

      Fortunato answered him with the utmost coolness:
    

      “Your gun is empty, and there are no more cartridges in your belt.”
    

      “I have my stiletto.”
    

      “But can you run as fast as I can?”
    

      He gave a leap and put himself out of reach.
    

      “You are not the son of Mateo Falcone! Will you then let me be
      captured before your house?”
    

      The child appeared moved.
    

      “What will you give me if I hide you?” said he, coming nearer.
    

      The outlaw felt in a leather pocket that hung from his belt, and took out
      a five-franc piece, which he had doubtless saved to buy ammunition with.
      Fortunato smiled at the sight of the silver piece; he snatched it, and
      said to Gianetto:
    

      “Fear nothing.”
    

      Immediately he made a great hole in a pile of hay that was near the house.
      Gianetto crouched down in it and the child covered him in such a way that
      he could breathe without it being possible to suspect that the hay
      concealed a man. He bethought himself further, and, with the subtlety of a
      tolerably ingenious savage, placed a cat and her kittens on the pile, that
      it might not appear to have been recently disturbed. Then, noticing the
      traces of blood on the path near the house, he covered them carefully with
      dust, and, that done, he again stretched himself out in the sun with the
      greatest tranquillity.
    

      A few moments afterwards, six men in brown uniforms with yellow collars,
      and commanded by an Adjutant, were before Mateo’s door. This
      Adjutant was a distant relative of Falcone’s. (In Corsica the
      degrees of relationship are followed much further than elsewhere.) His
      name was Tiodoro Gamba; he was an active man, much dreaded by the outlaws,
      several of whom he had already entrapped.
    

      “Good day, little cousin,” said he, approaching Fortunato;
      “how tall you have grown. Have you seen a man go past here just now?”
    

      “Oh! I am not yet so tall as you, my cousin,” replied the
      child with a simple air.
    

      “You soon will be. But haven’t you seen a man go by here, tell
      me?”
    

      “If I have seen a man go by?”
    

      “Yes, a man with a pointed hat of black velvet, and a vest
      embroidered with red and yellow.”
    

      “A man with a pointed hat, and a vest embroidered with red and
      yellow?”
    

      “Yes, answer quickly, and don’t repeat my questions?”
    

      “This morning the curÃ© passed before our door on his horse, Piero.
      He asked me how papa was, and I answered him—”
    

      “Ah, you little scoundrel, you are playing sly! Tell me quickly
      which way Gianetto went? We are looking for him, and I am sure he took
      this path.”
    

      “Who knows?”
    

      “Who knows? It is I know that you have seen him.”
    

      “Can any one see who passes when they are asleep?”
    

      “You were not asleep, rascal; the shooting woke you up.”
    

      “Then you believe, cousin, that your guns make so much noise? My
      father’s carbine has the advantage of them.”
    

      “The devil take you, you cursed little scapegrace! I am certain that
      you have seen Gianetto. Perhaps, even, you have hidden him. Come,
      comrades, go into the house and see if our man is there. He could only go
      on one foot, and the knave has too much good sense to try to reach the
      mÃ¢quis limping like that. Moreover, the bloody tracks stop here.”
    

      “And what will papa say?” asked Fortunato with a sneer;
      “what will he say if he knows that his house has been entered while
      he was away?”
    

      “You rascal!” said the Adjutant, taking him by the ear,
      “do you know that it only remains for me to make you change your
      tone? Perhaps you will speak differently after I have given you twenty
      blows with the flat of my sword.”
    

      Fortunato continued to sneer.
    

      “My father is Mateo Falcone,” said he with emphasis.
    

      “You little scamp, you know very well that I can carry you off to
      Corte or to Bastia. I will make you lie in a dungeon, on straw, with your
      feet in shackles, and I will have you guillotined if you don’t tell
      me where Gianetto is.”
    

      The child burst out laughing at this ridiculous menace. He repeated:
    

      “My father is Mateo Falcone.”
    

      “Adjutant,” said one of the soldiers in a low voice, “let
      us have no quarrels with Mateo.”
    

      Gamba appeared evidently embarrassed. He spoke in an undertone with the
      soldiers who had already visited the house. This was not a very long
      operation, for the cabin of a Corsican consists only of a single square
      room, furnished with a table, some benches, chests, housekeeping utensils
      and those of the chase. In the meantime, little Fortunato petted his cat
      and seemed to take a wicked enjoyment in the confusion of the soldiers and
      of his cousin.
    

      One of the men approached the pile of hay. He saw the cat, and gave the
      pile a careless thrust with his bayonet, shrugging his shoulders as if he
      felt that his precaution was ridiculous. Nothing moved; the boy’s
      face betrayed not the slightest emotion.
    

      The Adjutant and his troop were cursing their luck. Already they were
      looking in the direction of the plain, as if disposed to return by the way
      they had come, when their chief, convinced that menaces would produce no
      impression on Falcone’s son, determined to make a last effort, and
      try the effect of caresses and presents.
    

      “My little cousin,” said he, “you are a very wide-awake
      little fellow. You will get along. But you are playing a naughty game with
      me; and if I wasn’t afraid of making trouble for my cousin, Mateo,
      the devil take me! but I would carry you off with me.”
    

      “Bah!”
    

      “But when my cousin comes back I shall tell him about this, and he
      will whip you till the blood comes for having told such lies.”
    

      “You don’t say so!”
    

      “You will see. But hold on!—be a good boy and I will give you
      something.”
    

      “Cousin, let me give you some advice: if you wait much longer
      Gianetto will be in the mÃ¢quis and it will take a smarter man than you to
      follow him.”
    

      The Adjutant took from his pocket a silver watch worth about ten crowns,
      and noticing that Fortunato’s eyes sparkled at the sight of it,
      said, holding the watch by the end; of its steel chain:
    

      “Rascal! you would like to have such a watch as that hung around
      your neck, wouldn’t you, and to walk in the streets of Porto-Vecchio
      proud as a peacock? People would ask you what time it was, and you would
      say: ‘Look at my watch.’”
    

      “When I am grown up, my uncle, the Caporal, will give me a watch.”
    

      “Yes; but your uncle’s little boy has one already; not so fine
      as this either. But then, he is younger than you.”
    

      The child sighed.
    

      “Well! Would you like this watch, little cousin?”
    

      Fortunato, casting sidelong glances at the watch, resembled a cat that has
      been given a whole chicken. It feels that it is being made sport of, and
      does not dare to use its claws; from time to time it turns its eyes away
      so as not to be tempted, licking its jaws all the while, and has the
      appearance of saying to its master, “How cruel your joke is!”
    

      However, the Adjutant seemed in earnest in offering his watch. Fortunato
      did not reach out his hand for it, but said with a bitter smile:
    

      “Why do you make fun of me?”
    

      “Good God! I am not making fun of you. Only tell me where Gianetto
      is and the watch is yours.”
    

      Fortunato smiled incredulously, and fixing his black eyes on those of the
      Adjutant tried to read there the faith he ought to have had in his words.
    

      “May I lose my epaulettes,” cried the Adjutant, “if I do
      not give you the watch on this condition. These comrades are witnesses; I
      can not deny it.”
    

      While speaking he gradually held the watch nearer till it almost touched
      the child’s pale face, which plainly showed the struggle that was
      going on in his soul between covetousness and respect for hospitality. His
      breast swelled with emotion; he seemed about to suffocate. Meanwhile the
      watch was slowly swaying and turning, sometimes brushing against his
      cheek. Finally, his right hand was gradually stretched toward it; the ends
      of his fingers touched it; then its whole weight was in his hand, the
      Adjutant still keeping hold of the chain. The face was light blue; the
      cases newly burnished. In the sunlight it seemed to be all on fire. The
      temptation was too great. Fortunato raised his left hand and pointed over
      his shoulder with his thumb at the hay against which he was reclining. The
      Adjutant understood him at once. He dropped the end of the chain and
      Fortunato felt himself the sole possessor of the watch. He sprang up with
      the agility of a deer and stood ten feet from the pile, which the soldiers
      began at once to overturn.
    

      There was a movement in the hay, and a bloody man with a poignard in his
      hand appeared. He tried to rise to his feet, but his stiffened leg would
      not permit it and he fell. The Adjutant at once grappled with him and took
      away his stiletto. He was immediately secured, notwithstanding his
      resistance.
    

      Gianetto, lying on the earth and bound like a fagot, turned his head
      towards Fortunato, who had approached.
    

      “Son of—!” said he, with more contempt than anger.
    

      The child threw him the silver piece which he had received, feeling that
      he no longer deserved it; but the outlaw paid no attention to the
      movement, and with great coolness said to the Adjutant:
    

      “My dear Gamba, I cannot walk; you will be obliged to carry me to
      the city.”
    

      “Just now you could run faster than a buck,” answered the
      cruel captor; “but be at rest. I am so pleased to have you that I
      would carry you a league on my back without fatigue. Besides, comrade, we
      are going to make a litter for you with your cloak and some branches, and
      at the Crespoli farm we shall find horses.”
    

      “Good,” said the prisoner, “You will also put a little
      straw on your litter that I may be more comfortable.”
    

      While some of the soldiers were occupied in making a kind of stretcher out
      of some chestnut boughs and the rest were dressing Gianetto’s wound,
      Mateo Falcone and his wife suddenly appeared at a turn in the path that
      led to the mÃ¢quis. The woman was staggering under the weight of an
      enormous sack of chestnuts, while her husband was sauntering along,
      carrying one gun in his hands, while another was slung across his
      shoulders, for it is unworthy of a man to carry other burdens than his
      arms.
    

      At the sight of the soldiers Mateo’s first thought was that they had
      come to arrest him. But why this thought? Had he then some quarrels with
      justice? No. He enjoyed a good reputation. He was said to have a
      particularly good name, but he was a Corsican and a highlander, and there
      are few Corsican highlanders who, in scrutinizing their memory, can not
      find some peccadillo, such as a gun-shot, dagger-thrust, or similar
      trifles. Mateo more than others had a clear conscience; for more than ten
      years he had not pointed his carbine at a man, but he was always prudent,
      and put himself into a position to make a good defense if necessary.
      “Wife,” said he to Giuseppa, “put down the sack and hold
      yourself ready.”
    

      She obeyed at once. He gave her the gun that was slung across his
      shoulders, which would have bothered him, and, cocking the one he held in
      his hands, advanced slowly towards the house, walking among the trees that
      bordered the road, ready at the least hostile demonstration, to hide
      behind the largest, whence he could fire from under cover. His wife
      followed closely behind, holding his reserve weapon and his cartridge-box.
      The duty of a good housekeeper, in case of a fight, is to load her husband’s
      carbines.
    

      On the other side the Adjutant was greatly troubled to see Mateo advance
      in this manner, with cautious steps, his carbine raised, and his finger on
      the trigger.
    

      “If by chance,” thought he, “Mateo should be related to
      Gianetto, or if he should be his friend and wish to defend him, the
      contents of his two guns would arrive amongst us as certainly as a letter
      in the post; and if he should see me, notwithstanding the relationship!”
    

      In this perplexity he took a bold step. It was to advance alone towards
      Mateo and tell him of the affair while accosting him as an old
      acquaintance, but the short space that separated him from Mateo seemed
      terribly long.
    

      “Hello! old comrade,” cried he. “How do you do, my good
      fellow? It is I, Gamba, your cousin.”
    

      Without answering a word, Mateo stopped, and in proportion as the other
      spoke, slowly raised the muzzle of his gun so that it was pointing upward
      when the Adjutant joined him.
    

      “Good-day, brother,” said the Adjutant, holding out his hand.
      “It is a long time since I have seen you.”
    

      “Good-day, brother.”
    

      “I stopped while passing, to say good-day to you and to cousin Pepa
      here. We have had a long journey to-day, but have no reason to complain,
      for we have captured a famous prize. We have just seized Gianetto
      Saupiero.”
    

      “God be praised!” cried Giuseppa. “He stole a milch goat
      from us last week.”
    

      These words reassured Gamba.
    

      “Poor devil!” said Mateo, “he was hungry.”
    

      “The villain fought like a lion,” continued the Adjutant, a
      little mortified. “He killed one of my soldiers, and not content
      with that, broke Caporal Chardon’s arm; but that matters little, he
      is only a Frenchman. Then, too, he was so well hidden that the devil
      couldn’t have found him. Without my little cousin, Fortunato, I
      should never have discovered him.”
    

      “Fortunato!” cried Mateo.
    

      “Fortunato!” repeated Giuseppa.
    

      “Yes, Gianetto was hidden under the hay-pile yonder, but my little
      cousin showed me the trick. I shall tell his uncle, the Caporal, that he
      may send him a fine present for his trouble. Both his name and yours will
      be in the report that I shall send to the Attorney-general.”
    

      “Malediction!” said Mateo in a low voice.
    

      They had rejoined the detachment. Gianetto was already lying on the litter
      ready to set out. When he saw Mateo and Gamba in company he smiled a
      strange smile, then, turning his head towards the door of the house, he
      spat on the sill, saying:
    

      “House of a traitor.”
    

      Only a man determined to die would dare pronounce the word traitor to
      Falcone. A good blow with the stiletto, which there would be no need of
      repeating, would have immediately paid the insult. However, Mateo made no
      other movement than to place his hand on his forehead like a man who is
      dazed.
    

      Fortunato had gone into the house when his father arrived, but now he
      reappeared with a bowl of milk which he handed with downcast eyes to
      Gianetto.
    

      “Get away from me!” cried the outlaw, in a loud voice. Then,
      turning to one of the soldiers, he said:
    

      “Comrade, give me a drink.”
    

      The soldier placed his gourd in his hands, and the prisoner drank the
      water handed to him by a man with whom he had just exchanged bullets. He
      then asked them to tie his hands across his breast instead of behind his
      back.
    

      “I like,” said he, “to lie at my ease.”
    

      They hastened to satisfy him; then the Adjutant gave the signal to start,
      said adieu to Mateo, who did not respond, and descended with rapid steps
      towards the plain.
    

      Nearly ten minutes elapsed before Mateo spoke. The child looked with
      restless eyes, now at his mother, now at his father, who was leaning on
      his gun and gazing at him with an expression of concentrated rage.
    

      “You begin well,” said Mateo at last with a calm voice, but
      frightful to one who knew the man.
    

      “Oh, father!” cried the boy, bursting into tears, and making a
      forward movement as if to throw himself on his knees. But Mateo cried,
      “Away from me!”
    

      The little fellow stopped and sobbed, immovable, a few feet from his
      father.
    

      Giuseppa drew near. She had just discovered the watch-chain, the end of
      which was hanging out of Fortunato’s jacket.
    

      “Who gave you that watch?” demanded she in a severe tone.
    

      “My cousin, the Adjutant.”
    

      Falcone seized the watch and smashed it in a thousand pieces against a
      rock.
    

      “Wife,” said he, “is this my child?”
    

      Giuseppa’s cheeks turned a brick-red.
    

      “What are you saying, Mateo? Do you know to whom you speak?”
    

      “Very well, this child is the first of his race to commit treason.”
    

      Fortunato’s sobs and gasps redoubled as Falcone kept his lynx-eyes
      upon him. Then he struck the earth with his gun-stock, shouldered the
      weapon, and turned in the direction of the mÃ¢quis, calling to Fortunato to
      follow. The boy obeyed. Giuseppa hastened after Mateo and seized his arm.
    

      “He is your son,” said she with a trembling voice, fastening
      her black eyes on those of her husband to read what was going on in his
      heart.
    

      “Leave me alone,” said Mateo, “I am his father.”
    

      Giuseppa embraced her son, and bursting into tears entered the house. She
      threw herself on her knees before an image of the Virgin and prayed
      ardently. In the meanwhile Falcone walked some two hundred paces along the
      path and only stopped when he reached a little ravine which he descended.
      He tried the earth with the butt-end of his carbine, and found it soft and
      easy to dig. The place seemed to be convenient for his design.
    

      “Fortunato, go close to that big rock there.”
    

      The child did as he was commanded, then he kneeled.
    

      “Say your prayers.”
    

      “Oh, father, father, do not kill me!”
    

      “Say your prayers!” repeated Mateo in a terrible voice.
    

      The boy, stammering and sobbing, recited the Pater and the Credo. At the
      end of each prayer the father loudly answered, “Amen!”
    

      “Are those all the prayers you know?”
    

      “Oh! father, I know the Ave Maria and the litany that my aunt taught
      me.”
    

      “It is very long, but no matter.”
    

      The child finished the litany in a scarcely audible tone.
    

      “Are you finished?”
    

      “Oh! my father, have mercy! Pardon me! I will never do so again. I
      will beg my cousin, the Caporal, to pardon Gianetto.”
    

      He was still speaking. Mateo raised his gun, and, taking aim, said:
    

      “May God pardon you!”
    

      The boy made a desperate effort to rise and grasp his father’s
      knees, but there was not time. Mateo fired and Fortunato fell dead.
    

      Without casting a glance on the body, Mateo returned to the house for a
      spade with which to bury his son. He had gone but a few steps when he met
      Giuseppa, who, alarmed by the shot, was hastening hither.
    

      “What have you done?” cried she.
    

      “Justice.”
    

      “Where is he?”
    

      “In the ravine. I am going to bury him. He died a Christian. I shall
      have a mass said for him. Have my son-in-law, Tiodoro Bianchi, sent for to
      come and live with us.”
