THE TWO HOUSEWIVES

 BY CAROLYN WELLS

 Once on a Time there were Two Housewives who must Needs go to Market to
purchase the Day's Supplies.

 One of Them, who was of a Dilatory Nature, said:

 "I will not Hurry Myself, for I Doubt Not the Market contains Plenty for
all who come."

 She therefore Sauntered Forth at her Leisure, and on reaching the Market
she found to her Dismay that the Choicest Cuts and the Finest Produce
had All been Sold, and there remained for her only the Inferior Meats
and Some Withered Vegetables.

 The Other, who was One of the Hustling, Wide-awake Sort, said:

 "I will Bestir myself Betimes and Hasten to Market that I may Take my
Pick ere my Neighbors appear on the Scene."

 She did so, and when she Reached the Market she Discovered that the
Fresh Produce had not yet Arrived, and she must Content herself with the
Remnants of Yesterday's Stock.

Always as Good Fish In the Sea as Ever were Caught.
