MY SWEETHEART

 BY SAMUEL MINTURN PECK

  Her height? Perhaps you'd deem her tall— 

 To be exact, just five feet seven. 

 Her arching feet are not too small; 

 Her gleaming eyes are bits of heaven. 

 Slim are her hands, yet not too wee— 

 I could not fancy useless fingers, 

 Her hands are all that hands should be, 

 And own a touch whose memory lingers. 



 The hue that lights her oval cheeks 

 Recalls the pink that tints a cherry; 

 Upon her chin a dimple speaks, 

 A disposition blithe and merry. 

 Her laughter ripples like a brook; 

 Its sound a heart of stone would soften. 

 Though sweetness shines in every look, 

 Her laugh is never loud, nor often. 



 Though golden locks have won renown 

 With bards, I never heed their raving; 

 The girl I love hath locks of brown, 

 Not tightly curled, but gently waving. 

 Her mouth?—Perhaps you'd term it large— 

 Is firmly molded, full and curving; 

 Her quiet lips are Cupid's charge, 

 But in the cause of truth unswerving. 



 Though little of her neck is seen, 

 That little is both smooth and sightly; 

 And fair as marble is its sheen 

 Above her bodice gleaming whitely. 

 Her nose is just the proper size, 

 Without a trace of upward turning. 

 Her shell-like ears are wee and wise, 

 The tongue of scandal ever spurning. 



 In mirth and woe her voice is low, 

 Her calm demeanor never fluttered; 

 Her every accent seems to go 

 Straight to one's heart as soon as uttered. 

 She ne'er coquets as others do; 

 Her tender heart would never let her. 

 Where does she dwell? I would I knew; 

 As yet, alas! I've never met her.
