and that Too Many Cooks Spoil the Broth.

  YES?

 BY JOHN BOYLE O'REILLY

  The words of the lips are double or single, 

 True or false, as we say or sing: 

 But the words of the eyes that mix and mingle 

 Are always saying the same old thing. 



  FASCINATION

 BY JOHN B. TABB

  Among your many playmates here, 

 How is it that you all prefer 

 Your little friend, my dear? 

 "Because, mamma, tho' hard we try, 

 Not one of us can spit so high, 

 And catch it in his ear."
