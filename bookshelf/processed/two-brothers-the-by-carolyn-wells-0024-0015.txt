THE TWO BROTHERS
BY CAROLYN WELLS
Once on a Time there were Two Brothers who Set Out to make their Way In
The World.
One was of a Roving Disposition, and no sooner had he settled Down to
Live in One Place than he would Gather Up all his Goods and Chattels and
Move to another Place. From here again he would Depart and make him a
Fresh Home, and so on until he Became an Old Man and had gained neither
Fortune nor Friends.
The Other, being Disinclined to Change or Diversity of Scene, remained
all his Life in One Place. He therefore Became Narrow-Minded and
Provincial, and gained None of the Culture and Liberality of Nature
which comes from Contact with various Scenes of Life.
MORALS:
This Fable teaches that a Rolling Stone Gathers No Moss, and a Setting
Hen Never Grows Fat.
