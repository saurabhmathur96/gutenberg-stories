NATURAL PERVERSITIES

 BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY

  I am not prone to moralize 

 In scientific doubt 

 On certain facts that Nature tries 

 To puzzle us about,— 

 For I am no philosopher 

 Of wise elucidation, 

 But speak of things as they occur, 

 From simple observation. 



 I notice little things—to wit:— 

 I never missed a train 

 Because I didn't run for it; 

 I never knew it rain 

 That my umbrella wasn't lent,— 

 Or, when in my possession, 

 The sun but wore, to all intent, 

 A jocular expression. 



 I never knew a creditor 

 To dun me for a debt 

 But I was "cramped" or "busted"; or 

 I never knew one yet, 

 When I had plenty in my purse, 

 To make the least invasion,— 

 As I, accordingly perverse, 

 Have courted no occasion.





 Nor do I claim to comprehend 

 What Nature has in view 

 In giving us the very friend 

 To trust we oughtn't to.— 

 But so it is: The trusty gun 

 Disastrously exploded 

 Is always sure to be the one 

 We didn't think was loaded. 



 Our moaning is another's mirth,— 

 And what is worse by half, 

 We say the funniest thing on earth 

 And never raise a laugh: 

 Mid friends that love us overwell, 

 And sparkling jests and liquor, 

 Our hearts somehow are liable 

 To melt in tears the quicker. 



 We reach the wrong when most we seek 

 The right; in like effect, 

 We stay the strong and not the weak— 

 Do most when we neglect.— 

 Neglected genius—truth be said— 

 As wild and quick as tinder, 

 The more you seek to help ahead 

 The more you seem to hinder. 



 I've known the least the greatest, too— 

 And, on the selfsame plan, 

 The biggest fool I ever knew 

 Was quite a little man: 

 We find we ought, and then we won't— 

 We prove a thing, then doubt it,— 

 Know everything but when we don't 

 Know anything about it.
