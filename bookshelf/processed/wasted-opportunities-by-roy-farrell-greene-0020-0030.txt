WASTED OPPORTUNITIES  BY ROY FARRELL GREENE

  The lips I might have tasted, rosy ripe as any cherry, 

 How they pair off by the dozens when my memory goes back 

 Across the current of the years aboard of Fancy's ferry, 

 Which shuns the shores of What-We-Have and touches What-We-Lack. 

 The girl I took t' singin'-school one night, who vowed she'd never 

 Before walked with a feller 'thout her mother bein' by, 

 I reckon that her temptin' mouth will haunt my dreams forever, 

 The lips I might have tasted if I'd had the nerve t' try! 



 I recollect another girl, as chipper as a robin, 

 Who rode beside me in a sleigh one night through snow an' sleet, 

 An' both my hands I kept in use a guidin' good ol' Dobbin— 

 One didn't need them any mor'n a chicken needs four feet. 

 Too scared was I to hold her in, or warm her cheeks with kisses,— 

 I know, now, she expected it, for once I heard her sigh— 

 To-day I'd like t' kick myself for these neglected blisses, 

 The lips I might have tasted if I'd had the nerve t' try. 

  I never kissed Rebecca, she was sober as a Quaker, 

 I never kissed Alvira, though I took her home one night, 

 That city cousin of the Smiths, a Miss Myrtilla Baker, 

 Though scores of opportunities slipped by me, left an' right. 

 It makes me hate myself to-day when I on Fancy's ferry 

 Have crossed the current of the years to olden days gone by, 

 T' think of all the lips I've missed, ripe-red as topmost cherry, 

 The lips I might have tasted if I'd had the nerve t' try.
