A BALLADE OF THE "HOW TO" BOOKS
BY JOHN JAMES DAVIES

That time when Learning's path was steep,
And rocks and fissures marred the way,
The few who dared were forced to creep,
Their souls oft quaking with dismay;
The goal achieved, their hairs were gray,
Their bodies bent like shepherds' crooks;
How blest are we who run to-day
The easy road of "How To" books!

The presses groan, and volumes heap,
Our dullness we no more betray;
To know the stars, or shear a sheep—
To live on air, or polo play;
The trick is ours, or we may stray
Beneath the seas, with science cooks,
And sprint by some reflected ray
The easy road of "How To" books!

Who craves the boon of dreamless sleep?
Who bricks would make, sans straw or clay?
"Call spirits from the vasty deep,"
Or weave a lofty, living lay?
Let him be heartened, jocund, gay,
Nor hopeless writhe on tenter-hooks,—
They meet no barriers who essay
The easy road of "How To" books!

ENVOY

The critics still will slash and slay
Poor hapless scribes, in sanctum nooks;
Lo! here's a refuge for their prey—
The easy road of "How To" books!
