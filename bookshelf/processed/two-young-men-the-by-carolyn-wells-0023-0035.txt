THE TWO YOUNG MEN

 BY CAROLYN WELLS

 Once on a Time there were Two Young Men of Promising Capabilities.

 One pursued no Especial Branch of Education, but Contented himself with
a Smattering of many different Arts and Sciences, exhibiting a Moderate
Proficiency in Each. When he Came to Make a Choice of some means of
Earning a Livelihood, he found he was Unsuccessful, for he had no
Specialty, and Every Employer seemed to Require an Expert in his Line.

 The Other, from his Earliest Youth, bent all his Energies toward
Learning to play the Piano. He studied at Home and Abroad with Greatest
Masters, and he Achieved Wonderful Success. But as he was about to Begin
his Triumphant and Profitable Career, he had the Misfortune to lose both
Thumbs in a Railway Accident.

 Thus he was Deprived of his Intended Means of Earning a Living, and as
he had no other Accomplishment he was Forced to Subsist on Charity.

 MORALS:

 This Fable teaches that a Jack of all Trades is Master of None, and that
It Is Not Well to put All our Eggs in One Basket.
