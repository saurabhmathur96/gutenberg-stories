NONSENSE VERSES

 BY GELETT BURGESS

 1

  The Window has Four little Panes: 

 But One have I; 

 The Window-Panes are in its sash,— 

 I wonder why! 



 2

  My Feet they haul me 'round the House; 

 They hoist me up the Stairs; 

 I only have to steer them and 

 They ride me everywheres. 



 3

  Remarkable truly, is Art! 

 See—Elliptical wheels on a Cart! 

 It looks very fair 

 In the Picture up there; 

 But imagine the Ride when you start! 



 4

  I'd rather have fingers than Toes; 

 I'd rather have Ears than a Nose 

 And as for my hair, 

 I'm glad it's all there, 

 I'll be awfully sad when it goes! 

  5

  I wish that my Room had a floor; 

 I don't so much care for a Door, 

 But this walking around 

 Without touching the ground 

 Is getting to be quite a bore!
