THE WOMAN-HATER REFORMED

 BY ROY FARRELL GREENE

  He said to sue for maiden's heart 

 And hand required too much of art 

 In framing phrases, making pleas, 

 And swearing vows on bended knees 

 "Till death (or court decree) doth part." 



 One's oh, so apt to get the cart 

 Before the horse, and at the start 

 Break down. It's torture by degrees, 

 He said, to sue! 



 Yet when sweet Susan, coy but smart, 

 Safe landed him, and Cupid's dart 

 Went through his breast as through a cheese, 

 And pierced his heart with perfect ease, 

 Heâ€”well, I'll not the words impart 

 He said to Sue!
