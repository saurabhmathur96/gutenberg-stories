MY GRANDMOTHER'S TURKEY-TAIL FAN

 BY SAMUEL MINTURN PECK

  It owned not the color that vanity dons 

 Or slender wits choose for display; 

 Its beautiful tint was a delicate bronze, 

 A brown softly blended with gray. 

 From her waist to her chin, spreading out without break, 

 'Twas built on a generous plan: 

 The pride of the forest was slaughtered to make 

 My grandmother's turkey-tail fan. 



 For common occasions it never was meant: 

 In a chest between two silken cloths 

 'Twas kept safely hidden with careful intent 

 In camphor to keep out the moths. 

 'Twas famed far and wide through the whole countryside, 

 From Beersheba e'en unto Dan; 

 And often at meeting with envy 'twas eyed, 

 My grandmother's turkey-tail fan. 



 Camp-meetings, indeed, were its chiefest delight. 

 Like a crook unto sheep gone astray 

 It beckoned backsliders to re-seek the right, 

 And exhorted the sinners to pray. 

 It always beat time when the choir went wrong, 

 In psalmody leading the van. 

 Old Hundred, I know, was its favorite song— 

 My grandmother's turkey-tail fan. 



 A fig for the fans that are made nowadays, 

 Suited only to frivolous mirth! 

 A different thing was the fan that I praise, 

 Yet it scorned not the good things of earth. 

 At bees and at quiltings 'twas aye to be seen; 

 The best of the gossip began 

 When in at the doorway had entered serene 

 My grandmother's turkey-tail fan. 



 Tradition relates of it wonderful tales. 

 Its handle of leather was buff. 

 Though shorn of its glory, e'en now it exhales 

 An odor of hymn-books and snuff. 

 Its primeval grace, if you like, you can trace: 

 'Twas limned for the future to scan, 

 Just under a smiling gold-spectacled face, 

 My grandmother's turkey-tail fan.

 "Mr. Kleiser offers no panacea (as the title might seem to imply).
Logic will not make a dunce a philosopher, neither will it insure
success where success is not deserved. But what he does offer the
honest debater in this practical book, is to put him in possession
of those laws of argumentation which lie at the bottom of sound
reasoning, based on fact."— Times-Dispatch , Richmond, Va.
