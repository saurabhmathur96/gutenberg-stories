THE LITTLE MOCK-MAN

 BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY

  The Little Mock-man on the Stairs— 

 He mocks the lady's horse 'at rares 

 At bi-sickles an' things,— 

 He mocks the mens 'at rides 'em, too; 

 An' mocks the Movers, drivin' through, 

 An' hollers "Here's the way you do 

 With them-air hitchin'-strings!" 

 "Ho! ho!" he'll say, 

 Ole Settlers' Day, 

 When they're all jogglin' by,— 

 "You look like this ," 

 He'll say, an' twis' 

 His mouth an' squint his eye 

 An' 'tend like he wuz beat the bass 

 Drum at both ends—an' toots and blares 

 Ole dinner-horn an' puffs his face— 

 The Little Mock-man on the Stairs! 



 The Little Mock-man on the Stairs 

 Mocks all the peoples all he cares 

 'At passes up an' down! 

 He mocks the chickens round the door, 

 An' mocks the girl 'at scrubs the floor, 

 An' mocks the rich, an' mocks the pore, 

 An' ever'thing in town! 

 "Ho! ho!" says he, 

 To you er me; 

 An' ef we turns an' looks, 

 He's all cross-eyed 

 An' mouth all wide 

 Like Giunts is, in books.— 

 "Ho! ho!" he yells, "look here at me ," 

 An' rolls his fat eyes roun' an' glares,— 

 " You look like this! " he says, says he— 

 The Little Mock-man on the Stairs! 



 The Little Mock— 

 The Little Mock— 

 The Little Mock-man on the Stairs, 

 He mocks the music-box an' clock, 

 An' roller-sofy an' the chairs; 

 He mocks his Pa an' spec's he wears; 

 He mocks the man 'at picks the pears 

 An' plums an' peaches on the shares; 

 He mocks the monkeys an' the bears 

 On picture-bills, an' rips an' tears 

 'Em down,—an' mocks ist all he cares, 

 An' EVER'body EVER'wheres!
