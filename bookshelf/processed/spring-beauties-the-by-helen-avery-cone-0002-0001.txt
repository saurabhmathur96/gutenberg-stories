THE SPRING BEAUTIES

 By Helen Avery Cone

  The Puritan Spring Beauties stood freshly clad for church; 

 A thrush, white-breasted, o'er them sat singing on his perch. 

 "Happy be! for fair are ye!" the gentle singer told them; 

 But presently a buff-coat Bee came booming up to scold them. 

 "Vanity, oh, vanity! 

 Young maids, beware of vanity!" 

 Grumbled out the buff-coat Bee, 

 Half parson-like, half soldierly. 



 The sweet-faced maidens trembled, with pretty, pinky blushes, 

 Convinced that it was wicked to listen to the thrushes; 

 And when that shady afternoon, I chanced that way to pass, 

 They hung their little bonnets down and looked into the grass. 

 All because the buff-coat Bee 

 Lectured them so solemnlyâ€” 

 "Vanity, oh, vanity! 

 Young maids, beware of vanity!"
