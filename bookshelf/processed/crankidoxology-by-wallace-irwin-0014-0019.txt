CRANKIDOXOLOGY  BY WALLACE IRWIN

 ( Being a Mental Attitude from Bernard Pshaw )

  It's wrong to be thoroughly human, 

 It's stupid alone to be good, 

 And why should the "virtuous" woman 

 Continue to do as she should? 

 (It's stupid to do as you should!) 



 For I'd rather be famous than pleasant, 

 I'd rather be rude than polite; 

 It's easy to sneer 

 When you're witty and queer, 

 And I'd rather be Clever than Right. 



 I'm bored by mere Shakespeare and Milton, 

 Though Hubbard compels me to rave; 

 If I should lay laurels to wilt on 

 That foggy Shakespearean grave, 

 How William would squirm in his grave! 



 For I'd rather be Pshaw than be Shakespeare, 

 I'd rather be Candid than Wise; 

 And the way I amuse 

 Is to roundly abuse 

 The Public I feign to despise. 

  I'm a Socialist, loving my brother 

 In quite an original way, 

 With my maxim, "Detest One Another"— 

 Though, faith, I don't mean what I say. 

 (It's beastly to mean what you say!) 



 For I'm fonder of talk than of Husbands, 

 And I'm fonder of fads than of Wives, 

 So I say unto you, 

 If you don't as you do 

 You will do as you don't all your lives. 



 My "Candida's" ruddy as coral, 

 With thoughts quite too awfully plain— 

 If folks would just call me Immoral 

 I'd feel that I'd not lived in vain. 

 (It's nasty, this living in vain!) 



 For I'd rather be Martyred than Married, 

 I'd rather be tempted than tamed, 

 And if I had my way 

 (At least, so I say) 

 All Babes would be labeled, "Unclaimed." 



 I'm an epigrammatical Moses, 

 Whose humorous tablets of stone 

 Condemn affectations and poses— 

 Excepting a few of my own. 

 (I dote on a few of my own.) 



 For my method of booming the market 

 When Managers ask for a play 

 Is to say on a bluff, 

 "I'm so fond of my stuff 

 That I don't want it acted—go 'way!" 



 I'm the club-ladies' Topic of Topics, 

 Where solemn discussions are spent 

 In struggles as hot as the tropics, 

 Attempting to find what I meant. 

 ( I never can tell what I meant!) 



 For it's fun to make bosh of the Gospel, 

 And it's sport to make gospel of Bosh, 

 While divorcées hurrah 

 For the Sayings of Pshaw 

 And his sub-psychological Josh.
