A MODERN ADVANTAGE

 BY CHARLOTTE BECKER

  One morning, when the sun shone bright 

 And all the earth was fair, 

 I met a little city child, 

 Whose ravings rent the air. 



 "I lucidly can penetrate 

 The Which," I heard him say,— 

 "The How is, wonderfully, come 

 To clear the limpid way. 



 "The sentence, rarely, rose and fell 

 From ceiling to the floor; 

 Her words were spotlessly arranged, 

 She gave me, strangely, more." 



 "What troubles you, my little man?" 

 I dared to ask him then,— 

 He fixed me with a subtle stare, 

 And said, "Most clearly, when 



 "You see I'm occupied, it's rude 

 To question of my aims— 

 I'm going to the adverb school 

 Of Mr. Henry James!"
