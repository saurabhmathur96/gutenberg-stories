This tale the sacristan of the church of St. Eulalie at
    Neuville d'Aumont told me, as we sat under the arbor of the
    White Horse, one fine summer evening, drinking a bottle of old
    wine to the health of the dead man, now very much at his ease,
    whom that very morning he had borne to the grave with full
    honors, beneath a pall powdered with smart silver tears.
"My poor father who is dead" (it is the sacristan who is
    speaking,) "was in his lifetime a grave-digger. He was of an
    agreeable disposition, the result, no doubt, of the calling he
    followed, for it has often been pointed out that people who
    work in cemeteries are of a jovial turn. Death has no terrors
    for them; they never give it a thought. I, for instance,
    monsieur, enter a cemetery at night as little perturbed as
    though it were the arbor of the White Horse. And if by chance I
    meet with a ghost, I don't disturb myself in the least about
    it, for I reflect that he may just as likely have business of
    his own to attend to as I. I know the habits of the dead, and I
    know their character. Indeed, so far as that goes, I know
    things of which the priests themselves are ignorant. If I were
    to tell you all I have seen, you would be astounded. But a
    still tongue makes a wise head, and my father, who, all the
    same, delighted in spinning a yarn, did not disclose a
    twentieth part of what he knew. To make up for this he often
    repeated the same stories, and to my knowledge he told the
    story of Catherine Fontaine at least a hundred times.
"Catherine Fontaine was an old maid whom he well remembered
    having seen when he was a mere child. I should not be surprised
    if there were still, perhaps, three old fellows in the district
    who could remember having heard folks speak of her, for she was
    very well known and of excellent reputation, though poor
    enough. She lived at the corner of the Rue aux Nonnes, in the
    turret which is still to be seen there, and which formed part
    of an old half-ruined mansion looking on to the garden of the
    Ursuline nuns. On that turret can still be traced certain
    figures and half-obliterated inscriptions. The late curé
    of St. Eulalie, Monsieur Levasseur, asserted that there are the
    words in Latin, Love is stronger than death, 'which is
    to be understood,' so he would add, 'of divine love.'
"Catherine Fontaine lived by herself in this tiny apartment.
    She was a lace-maker. You know, of course, that the lace made
    in our part of the world was formerly held in high esteem. No
    one knew anything of her relatives or friends. It was reported
    that when she was eighteen years of age she had loved the young
    Chevalier d'Aumont-Cléry, and had been secretly
    affianced to him. But decent folk didn't believe a word of it,
    and said it was nothing but a tale concocted because Catherine
    Fontaine's demeanor was that of a lady rather than that of a
    working woman, and because, moreover, she possessed beneath her
    white locks the remains of great beauty. Her expression was
    sorrowful, and on one finger she wore one of those rings
    fashioned by the goldsmith into the semblance of two tiny hands
    clasped together. In former days folks were accustomed to
    exchange such rings at their betrothal ceremony. I am sure you
    know the sort of thing I mean.
"Catherine Fontaine lived a saintly life. She spent a great
    deal of time in churches, and every morning, whatever might be
    the weather, she went to assist at the six o'clock Mass at St.
    Eulalie.
"Now one December night, whilst she was in her little
    chamber, she was awakened by the sound of bells, and nothing
    doubting that they were ringing for the first Mass, the pious
    woman dressed herself, and came downstairs and out into the
    street. The night was so obscure that not even the walls of the
    houses were visible, and not a ray of light shone from the
    murky sky. And such was the silence amid this black darkness,
    that there was not even the sound of a distant dog barking, and
    a feeling of aloofness from every living creature was
    perceptible. But Catherine Fontaine knew well every single
    stone she stepped on, and, as she could have found her way to
    the church with her eyes shut, she reached without difficulty
    the corner of the Rue aux Nonnes and the Rue de la Paroisse,
    where the timbered house stands with the tree of Jesse carved
    on one of its massive beams. When she reached this spot she
    perceived that the church doors were open, and that a great
    light was streaming out from the wax tapers. She resumed her
    journey, and when she had passed through the porch she found
    herself in the midst of a vast congregation which entirely
    filled the church. But she did not recognize any of the
    worshipers and was surprised to observe that all of these
    people were dressed in velvets and brocades, with feathers in
    their hats, and that they wore swords in the fashion of days
    gone by. Here were gentlemen who carried tall canes with gold
    knobs, and ladies with lace caps fastened with coronet-shaped
    combs. Chevaliers of the Order of St. Louis extended their
    hands to these ladies, who concealed behind their fans painted
    faces, of which only the powdered brow and the patch at the
    corner of the eye were visible! All of them proceeded to take
    their places without the slightest sound, and as they moved
    neither the sound of their footsteps on the pavement, nor the
    rustle of their garments could be heard. The lower places were
    filled with a crowd of young artisans in brown jackets, dimity
    breeches, and blue stockings, with their arms round the waists
    of pretty blushing girls who lowered their eyes. Near the holy
    water stoups peasant women, in scarlet petticoats and laced
    bodices, sat upon the ground as immovable as domestic animals,
    whilst young lads, standing up behind them, stared out from
    wide-open eyes and twirled their hats round and round on their
    fingers, and all these sorrowful countenances seemed centred
    irremovably on one and the same thought, at once sweet and
    sorrowful. On her knees, in her accustomed place, Catherine
    Fontaine saw the priest advance toward the altar, preceded by
    two servers. She recognized neither priest nor clerks. The Mass
    began. It was a silent Mass, during which neither the sound of
    the moving lips nor the tinkle of the bell was audible.
    Catherine Fontaine felt that she was under the observation and
    the influence also of her mysterious neighbor, and when,
    scarcely turning her head, she stole a glance at him, she
    recognized the young Chevalier d'Aumont-Cléry, who had
    once loved her, and who had been dead for five and forty years.
    She recognized him by a small mark which he had over the left
    ear, and above all by the shadow which his long black eyelashes
    cast upon his cheeks. He was dressed in his hunting clothes,
    scarlet with gold lace, the very clothes he wore that day when
    he met her in St. Leonard's Wood, begged of her a drink, and
    stole a kiss. He had preserved his youth and good looks. When
    he smiled, he still displayed magnificent teeth. Catherine said
    to him in an undertone:
"'Monseigneur, you who were my friend, and to whom in days
    gone by I gave all that a girl holds most dear, may God keep
    you in His grace! O, that He would at length inspire me with
    regret for the sin I committed in yielding to you; for it is a
    fact that, though my hair is white and I approach my end, I
    have not yet repented of having loved you. But, dear dead
    friend and noble seigneur, tell me, who are these folk, habited
    after the antique fashion, who are here assisting at this
    silent Mass?'
"The Chevalier d'Aumont-Cléry replied in a voice
    feebler than a breath, but none the less crystal clear:
"'Catherine, these men and women are souls from purgatory
    who have grieved God by sinning as we ourselves sinned through
    love of the creature, but who are not on that account cast off
    by God, inasmuch as their sin, like ours, was not
    deliberate.
"'Whilst separated from those whom they loved upon earth,
    they are purified in the cleansing fires of purgatory, they
    suffer the pangs of absence, which is for them the most cruel
    of tortures. They are so unhappy that an angel from heaven
    takes pity upon their love-torment. By the permission of the
    Most High, for one hour in the night, he reunites each year
    lover to loved in their parish church, where they are permitted
    to assist at the Mass of Shadows, hand clasped in hand. These
    are the facts. If it has been granted to me to see thee before
    thy death, Catherine, it is a boon which is bestowed by God's
    special permission.'
"And Catherine Fontaine answered him:
"'I would die gladly enough, dear, dead lord, if I might
    recover the beauty that was mine when I gave you to drink in
    the forest.'
"Whilst they thus conversed under their breath, a very old
    canon was taking the collection and proffering to the
    worshipers a great copper dish, wherein they let fall, each in
    his turn, ancient coins which have long since ceased to pass
    current: écus of six livres, florins, ducats and
    ducatoons, jacobuses and rose-nobles, and the pieces fell
    silently into the dish. When at length it was placed before the
    Chevalier, he dropped into it a louis which made no more sound
    than had the other pieces of gold and silver.
"Then the old canon stopped before Catherine Fontaine, who
    fumbled in her pocket without being able to find a farthing.
    Then, being unwilling to allow the dish to pass without an
    offering from herself, she slipped from her finger the ring
    which the Chevalier had given her the day before his death, and
    cast it into the copper bowl. As the golden ring fell, a sound
    like the heavy clang of a bell rang out, and on the stroke of
    this reverberation the Chevalier, the canon, the celebrant, the
    servers, the ladies and their cavaliers, the whole assembly
    vanished utterly; the candles guttered out, and Catherine
    Fontaine was left alone in the darkness."
Having concluded his narrative after this fashion, the
    sacristan drank a long draught of wine, remained pensive for a
    moment, and then resumed his talk in these words:
"I have told you this tale exactly as my father has told it
    to me over and over again, and I believe that it is authentic,
    because it agrees in all respects with what I have observed of
    the manners and customs peculiar to those who have passed away.
    I have associated a good deal with the dead ever since my
    childhood, and I know that they are accustomed to return to
    what they have loved.
"It is on this account that the miserly dead wander at night
    in the neighborhood of the treasures they conceal during their
    life time. They keep a strict watch over their gold; but the
    trouble they give themselves, far from being of service to
    them, turns to their disadvantage; and it is not a rare thing
    at all to come upon money buried in the ground on digging in a
    place haunted by a ghost. In the same way deceased husbands
    come by night to harass their wives who have made a second
    matrimonial venture, and I could easily name several who have
    kept a better watch over their wives since death than they ever
    did while living.
"That sort of thing is blameworthy, for in all fairness the
    dead have no business to stir up jealousies. Still I do but
    tell you what I have observed myself. It is a matter to take
    into account if one marries a widow. Besides, the tale I have
    told you is vouchsafed for in the manner following:
"The morning after that extraordinary night Catherine
    Fontaine was discovered dead in her chamber. And the beadle
    attached to St. Eulalie found in the copper bowl used for the
    collection a gold ring with two clasped hands. Besides, I'm not
    the kind of man to make jokes. Suppose we order another bottle
    of wine?..."

What Was It?
By FITZ-JAMES O'BRIEN
It is, I confess, with considerable diffidence, that I
    approach the strange narrative which I am about to relate. The
    events which I purpose detailing are of so extraordinary a
    character that I am quite prepared to meet with an unusual
    amount of incredulity and scorn. I accept all such beforehand.
    I have, I trust, the literary courage to face unbelief. I have,
    after mature consideration resolved to narrate, in as simple
    and straightforward a manner as I can compass, some facts that
    passed under my observation, in the month of July last, and
    which, in the annals of the mysteries of physical science, are
    wholly unparalleled.
I live at No. —— Twenty-sixth Street, in New
    York. The house is in some respects a curious one. It has
    enjoyed for the last two years the reputation of being haunted.
    It is a large and stately residence, surrounded by what was
    once a garden, but which is now only a green enclosure used for
    bleaching clothes. The dry basin of what has been a fountain,
    and a few fruit trees ragged and unpruned, indicate that this
    spot in past days was a pleasant, shady retreat, filled with
    fruits and flowers and the sweet murmur of waters.
The house is very spacious. A hall of noble size leads to a
    large spiral staircase winding through its center, while the
    various apartments are of imposing dimensions. It was built
    some fifteen or twenty years since by Mr. A——, the
    well-known New York merchant, who five years ago threw the
    commercial world into convulsions by a stupendous bank fraud.
    Mr. A——, as everyone knows, escaped to Europe, and
    died not long after, of a broken heart. Almost immediately
    after the news of his decease reached this country and was
    verified, the report spread in Twenty-sixth Street that No.
    —— was haunted. Legal measures had dispossessed the
    widow of its former owner, and it was inhabited merely by a
    caretaker and his wife, placed there by the house agent into
    whose hands it had passed for the purposes of renting or sale.
    These people declared that they were troubled with unnatural
    noises. Doors were opened without any visible agency. The
    remnants of furniture scattered through the various rooms were,
    during the night, piled one upon the other by unknown hands.
    Invisible feet passed up and down the stairs in broad daylight,
    accompanied by the rustle of unseen silk dresses, and the
    gliding of viewless hands along the massive balusters. The
    caretaker and his wife declared they would live there no
    longer. The house agent laughed, dismissed them, and put others
    in their place. The noises and supernatural manifestations
    continued. The neighborhood caught up the story, and the house
    remained untenanted for three years. Several persons negotiated
    for it; but, somehow, always before the bargain was closed they
    heard the unpleasant rumors and declined to treat any
    further.
It was in this state of things that my landlady, who at that
    time kept a boarding-house in Bleecker Street, and who wished
    to move further up town, conceived the bold idea of renting No.
    —— Twenty-sixth Street. Happening to have in her
    house rather a plucky and philosophical set of boarders, she
    laid her scheme before us, stating candidly everything she had
    heard respecting the ghostly qualities of the establishment to
    which she wished to remove us. With the exception of two timid
    persons,—a sea-captain and a returned Californian, who
    immediately gave notice that they would leave,—all of
    Mrs. Moffat's guests declared that they would accompany her in
    her chivalric incursion into the abode of spirits.
Our removal was effected in the month of May, and we were
    charmed with our new residence. The portion of Twenty-sixth
    Street where our house is situated, between Seventh and Eighth
    Avenues, is one of the pleasantest localities in New York. The
    gardens back of the houses, running down nearly to the Hudson,
    form, in the summer time, a perfect avenue of verdure. The air
    is pure and invigorating, sweeping, as it does, straight across
    the river from the Weehawken heights, and even the ragged
    garden which surrounded the house, although displaying on
    washing days rather too much clothesline, still gave us a piece
    of greensward to look at, and a cool retreat in the summer
    evenings, where we smoked our cigars in the dusk, and watched
    the fireflies flashing their dark lanterns in the long
    grass.
Of course we had no sooner established ourselves at No.
    —— than we began to expect ghosts. We absolutely
    awaited their advent with eagerness. Our dinner conversation
    was supernatural. One of the boarders, who had purchased Mrs.
    Crowe's Night Side of Nature for his own private
    delectation, was regarded as a public enemy by the entire
    household for not having bought twenty copies. The man led a
    life of supreme wretchedness while he was reading this volume.
    A system of espionage was established, of which he was the
    victim. If he incautiously laid the book down for an instant
    and left the room, it was immediately seized and read aloud in
    secret places to a select few. I found myself a person of
    immense importance, it having leaked out that I was tolerably
    well versed in the history of supernaturalism, and had once
    written a story the foundation of which was a ghost. If a table
    or a wainscot panel happened to warp when we were assembled in
    the large drawing-room, there was an instant silence, and
    everyone was prepared for an immediate clanking of chains and a
    spectral form.
After a month of psychological excitement, it was with the
    utmost dissatisfaction that we were forced to acknowledge that
    nothing in the remotest degree approaching the supernatural had
    manifested itself. Once the black butler asseverated that his
    candle had been blown out by some invisible agency while he was
    undressing himself for the night; but as I had more than once
    discovered this colored gentleman in a condition when one
    candle must have appeared to him like two, thought it possible
    that, by going a step further in his potations, he might have
    reversed this phenomenon, and seen no candle at all where he
    ought to have beheld one.
Things were in this state when an accident took place so
    awful and inexplicable in its character that my reason fairly
    reels at the bare memory of the occurrence. It was the tenth of
    July. After dinner was over I repaired, with my friend Dr.
    Hammond, to the garden to smoke my evening pipe. Independent of
    certain mental sympathies which existed between the Doctor and
    myself, we were linked together by a vice. We both smoked
    opium. We knew each other's secret, and respected it. We
    enjoyed together that wonderful expansion of thought, that
    marvelous intensifying of the perceptive faculties, that
    boundless feeling of existence when we seem to have points of
    contact with the whole universe,—in short, that
    unimaginable spiritual bliss, which I would not surrender for a
    throne, and which I hope you, reader, will never—never
    taste.
Those hours of opium happiness which the Doctor and I spent
    together in secret were regulated with a scientific accuracy.
    We did not blindly smoke the drug of paradise, and leave our
    dreams to chance. While smoking, we carefully steered our
    conversation through the brightest and calmest channels of
    thought. We talked of the East, and endeavored to recall the
    magical panorama of its glowing scenery. We criticized the most
    sensuous poets,—those who painted life ruddy with health,
    brimming with passion, happy in the possession of youth and
    strength and beauty. If we talked of Shakespeare's
    Tempest, we lingered over Ariel, and avoided Caliban.
    Like the Guebers, we turned our faces to the East, and saw only
    the sunny side of the world.
This skillful coloring of our train of thought produced in
    our subsequent visions a corresponding tone. The splendors of
    Arabian fairyland dyed our dreams. We paced the narrow strip of
    grass with the tread and port of kings. The song of the
    Rana arborea, while he clung to the bark of the ragged
    plum-tree, sounded like the strains of divine musicians.
    Houses, walls, and streets melted like rain clouds, and vistas
    of unimaginable glory stretched away before us. It was a
    rapturous companionship. We enjoyed the vast delight more
    perfectly because, even in our most ecstatic moments, we were
    conscious of each other's presence. Our pleasures, while
    individual, were still twin, vibrating and moving in musical
    accord.
On the evening in question, the tenth of July, the Doctor
    and myself drifted into an unusually metaphysical mood. We lit
    our large meerschaums, filled with fine Turkish tobacco, in the
    core of which burned a little black nut of opium, that, like
    the nut in the fairy tale, held within its narrow limits
    wonders beyond the reach of kings; we paced to and fro,
    conversing. A strange perversity dominated the currents of our
    thought. They would not flow through the sun-lit
    channels into which we strove to divert them. For some
    unaccountable reason, they constantly diverged into dark and
    lonesome beds, where a continual gloom brooded. It was in vain
    that, after our old fashion, we flung ourselves on the shores
    of the East, and talked of its gay bazaars, of the splendors of
    the time of Haroun, of harems and golden palaces. Black afreets
    continually arose from the depths of our talk, and expanded,
    like the one the fisherman released from the copper vessel,
    until they blotted everything bright from our vision.
    Insensibly, we yielded to the occult force that swayed us, and
    indulged in gloomy speculation. We had talked some time upon
    the proneness of the human mind to mysticism, and the almost
    universal love of the terrible, when Hammond suddenly said to
    me. "What do you consider to be the greatest element of
    terror?"
The question puzzled me. That many things were terrible, I
    knew. Stumbling over a corpse in the dark; beholding, as I once
    did, a woman floating down a deep and rapid river, with wildly
    lifted arms, and awful, upturned face, uttering, as she
    drifted, shrieks that rent one's heart while we, spectators,
    stood frozen at a window which overhung the river at a height
    of sixty feet, unable to make the slightest effort to save her,
    but dumbly watching her last supreme agony and her
    disappearance. A shattered wreck, with no life visible,
    encountered floating listlessly on the ocean, is a terrible
    object, for it suggests a huge terror, the proportions of which
    are veiled. But it now struck me, for the first time, that
    there must be one great and ruling embodiment of fear,—a
    King of Terrors, to which all others must succumb. What might
    it be? To what train of circumstances would it owe its
    existence?
"I confess, Hammond," I replied to my friend, "I never
    considered the subject before. That there must be one Something
    more terrible than any other thing, I feel. I cannot attempt,
    however, even the most vague definition."
"I am somewhat like you, Harry," he answered. "I feel my
    capacity to experience a terror greater than anything yet
    conceived by the human mind;—something combining in
    fearful and unnatural amalgamation hitherto supposed
    incompatible elements. The calling of the voices in Brockden
    Brown's novel of Wieland is awful; so is the picture
    of the Dweller of the Threshold, in Bulwer's Zanoni;
    but," he added, shaking his head gloomily, "there is something
    more horrible still than those."
"Look here, Hammond," I rejoined, "let us drop this kind of
    talk, for Heaven's sake! We shall suffer for it, depend on
    it."
"I don't know what's the matter with me to-night," he
    replied, "but my brain is running upon all sorts of weird and
    awful thoughts. I feel as if I could write a story like
    Hoffman, to-night, if I were only master of a literary
    style."
"Well, if we are going to be Hoffmanesque in our talk, I'm
    off to bed. Opium and nightmares should never be brought
    together. How sultry it is! Good-night, Hammond."
"Good-night, Harry. Pleasant dreams to you."
"To you, gloomy wretch, afreets, ghouls, and
    enchanters."
We parted, and each sought his respective chamber. I
    undressed quickly and got into bed, taking with me, according
    to my usual custom, a book, over which I generally read myself
    to sleep. I opened the volume as soon as I had laid my head
    upon the pillow, and instantly flung it to the other side of
    the room. It was Goudon's History of Monsters,—a
    curious French work, which I had lately imported from Paris,
    but which, in the state of mind I had then reached, was
    anything but an agreeable companion. I resolved to go to sleep
    at once; so, turning down my gas until nothing but a little
    blue point of light glimmered on the top of the tube, I
    composed myself to rest.
The room was in total darkness. The atom of gas that still
    remained alight did not illuminate a distance of three inches
    round the burner. I desperately drew my arm across my eyes, as
    if to shut out even the darkness, and tried to think of
    nothing. It was in vain. The confounded themes touched on by
    Hammond in the garden kept obtruding themselves on my brain. I
    battled against them. I erected ramparts of would-be blackness
    of intellect to keep them out. They still crowded upon me.
    While I was lying still as a corpse, hoping that by a perfect
    physical inaction I should hasten mental repose, an awful
    incident occurred. A Something dropped, as it seemed, from the
    ceiling, plumb upon my chest, and the next instant I felt two
    bony hands encircling my throat, endeavoring to choke me.
I am no coward, and am possessed of considerable physical
    strength. The suddenness of the attack, instead of stunning me,
    strung every nerve to its highest tension. My body acted from
    instinct, before my brain had time to realize the terrors of my
    position. In an instant I wound two muscular arms around the
    creature, and squeezed it, with all the strength of despair,
    against my chest. In a few seconds the bony hands that had
    fastened on my throat loosened their hold, and I was free to
    breathe once more. Then commenced a struggle of awful
    intensity. Immersed in the most profound darkness, totally
    ignorant of the nature of the Thing by which I was so suddenly
    attacked, finding my grasp slipping every moment, by reason, it
    seemed to me, of the entire nakedness of my assailant, bitten
    with sharp teeth in the shoulder, neck, and chest, having every
    moment to protect my throat against a pair of sinewy, agile
    hands, which my utmost efforts could not confine,—these
    were a combination of circumstances to combat which required
    all the strength, skill, and courage that I possessed.
At last, after a silent, deadly, exhausting struggle, I got
    my assailant under by a series of incredible efforts of
    strength. Once pinned, with my knee on what I made out to be
    its chest, I knew that I was victor. I rested for a moment to
    breathe. I heard the creature beneath me panting in the
    darkness, and felt the violent throbbing of a heart. It was
    apparently as exhausted as I was; that was one comfort. At this
    moment I remembered that I usually placed under my pillow,
    before going to bed, a large yellow silk pocket handkerchief. I
    felt for it instantly; it was there. In a few seconds more I
    had, after a fashion, pinioned the creature's arms.
I now felt tolerably secure. There was nothing more to be
    done but to turn on the gas, and, having first seen what my
    midnight assailant was like, arouse the household. I will
    confess to being actuated by a certain pride in not giving the
    alarm before; I wished to make the capture alone and
    unaided.
Never losing my hold for an instant, I slipped from the bed
    to the floor, dragging my captive with me. I had but a few
    steps to make to reach the gas-burner; these I made with the
    greatest caution, holding the creature in a grip like a vice.
    At last I got within arm's length of the tiny speck of blue
    light which told me where the gas-burner lay. Quick as
    lightning I released my grasp with one hand and let on the full
    flood of light. Then I turned to look at my captive.
I cannot even attempt to give any definition of my
    sensations the instant after I turned on the gas. I suppose I
    must have shrieked with terror, for in less than a minute
    afterward my room was crowded with the inmates of the house. I
    shudder now as I think of that awful moment. I saw
    nothing! Yes; I had one arm firmly clasped round a
    breathing, panting, corporeal shape, my other hand gripped with
    all its strength a throat as warm, as apparently fleshy, as my
    own; and yet, with this living substance in my grasp, with its
    body pressed against my own, and all in the bright glare of a
    large jet of gas, I absolutely beheld nothing! Not even an
    outline,—a vapor!
I do not, even at this hour, realize the situation in which
    I found myself. I cannot recall the astounding incident
    thoroughly. Imagination in vain tries to compass the awful
    paradox.
It breathed. I felt its warm breath upon my cheek. It
    struggled fiercely. It had hands. They clutched me. Its skin
    was smooth, like my own. There it lay, pressed close up against
    me, solid as stone,—and yet utterly invisible!
I wonder that I did not faint or go mad on the instant. Some
    wonderful instinct must have sustained me; for, absolutely, in
    place of loosening my hold on the terrible Enigma, I seemed to
    gain an additional strength in my moment of horror, and
    tightened my grasp with such wonderful force that I felt the
    creature shivering with agony.
Just then Hammond entered my room at the head of the
    household. As soon as he beheld my face—which, I suppose,
    must have been an awful sight to look at—he hastened
    forward, crying, "Great heaven, Harry! what has happened?"
"Hammond! Hammond!" I cried, "come here. O, this is awful! I
    have been attacked in bed by something or other, which I have
    hold of; but I can't see it,—I can't see it!"
Hammond, doubtless struck by the unfeigned horror expressed
    in my countenance, made one or two steps forward with an
    anxious yet puzzled expression. A very audible titter burst
    from the remainder of my visitors. This suppressed laughter
    made me furious. To laugh at a human being in my position! It
    was the worst species of cruelty. Now, I can
    understand why the appearance of a man struggling violently, as
    it would seem, with an airy nothing, and calling for assistance
    against a vision, should have appeared ludicrous.
    Then, so great was my rage against the mocking crowd
    that had I the power I would have stricken them dead where they
    stood.
"Hammond! Hammond!" I cried again, despairingly, "for God's
    sake come to me. I can hold the—the thing but a short
    while longer. It is overpowering me. Help me! Help me!"
"Harry," whispered Hammond, approaching me, "you have been
    smoking too much opium."
"I swear to you, Hammond, that this is no vision," I
    answered, in the same low tone. "Don't you see how it shakes my
    whole frame with its struggles? If you don't believe me,
    convince yourself. Feel it,—touch it."
Hammond advanced and laid his hand in the spot I indicated.
    A wild cry of horror burst from him. He had felt it!
In a moment he had discovered somewhere in my room a long
    piece of cord, and was the next instant winding it and knotting
    it about the body of the unseen being that I clasped in my
    arms.
"Harry," he said, in a hoarse, agitated voice, for, though
    he preserved his presence of mind, he was deeply moved, "Harry,
    it's all safe now. You may let go, old fellow, if you're tired.
    The Thing can't move."
I was utterly exhausted, and I gladly loosed my hold.
Hammond stood holding the ends of the cord that bound the
    Invisible, twisted round his hand, while before him,
    self-supporting as it were, he beheld a rope laced and
    interlaced, and stretching tightly around a vacant space. I
    never saw a man look so thoroughly stricken with awe.
    Nevertheless his face expressed all the courage and
    determination which I knew him to possess. His lips, although
    white, were set firmly, and one could perceive at a glance
    that, although stricken with fear, he was not daunted.
The confusion that ensued among the guests of the house who
    were witnesses of this extraordinary scene between Hammond and
    myself,—who beheld the pantomime of binding this
    struggling Something,—who beheld me almost sinking from
    physical exhaustion when my task of jailer was over,—the
    confusion and terror that took possession of the bystanders,
    when they saw all this, was beyond description. The weaker ones
    fled from the apartment. The few who remained clustered near
    the door and could not be induced to approach Hammond and his
    Charge. Still incredulity broke out through their terror. They
    had not the courage to satisfy themselves, and yet they
    doubted. It was in vain that I begged of some of the men to
    come near and convince themselves by touch of the existence in
    that room of a living being which was invisible. They were
    incredulous, but did not dare to undeceive themselves. How
    could a solid, living, breathing body be invisible, they asked.
    My reply was this. I gave a sign to Hammond, and both of
    us—conquering our fearful repugnance to touch the
    invisible creature—lifted it from the ground, manacled as
    it was, and took it to my bed. Its weight was about that of a
    boy of fourteen.
"Now my friends," I said, as Hammond and myself held the
    creature suspended over the bed, "I can give you self-evident
    proof that here is a solid, ponderable body, which,
    nevertheless, you cannot see. Be good enough to watch the
    surface of the bed attentively."
I was astonished at my own courage in treating this strange
    event so calmly; but I had recovered from my first terror, and
    felt a sort of scientific pride in the affair, which dominated
    every other feeling.
The eyes of the bystanders were immediately fixed on my bed.
    At a given signal Hammond and I let the creature fall. There
    was a dull sound of a heavy body alighting on a soft mass. The
    timbers of the bed creaked. A deep impression marked itself
    distinctly on the pillow, and on the bed itself. The crowd who
    witnessed this gave a low cry, and rushed from the room.
    Hammond and I were left alone with our Mystery.
We remained silent for some time, listening to the low,
    irregular breathing of the creature on the bed, and watching
    the rustle of the bedclothes as it impotently struggled to free
    itself from confinement. Then Hammond spoke.
"Harry, this is awful."
"Ay, awful."
"But not unaccountable."
"Not unaccountable! What do you mean? Such a thing has never
    occurred since the birth of the world. I know not what to
    think, Hammond. God grant that I am not mad, and that this is
    not an insane fantasy!"
"Let us reason a little, Harry. Here is a solid body which
    we touch, but which we cannot see. The fact is so unusual that
    it strikes us with terror. Is there no parallel, though, for
    such a phenomenon? Take a piece of pure glass. It is tangible
    and transparent. A certain chemical coarseness is all that
    prevents its being so entirely transparent as to be totally
    invisible. It is not theoretically impossible, mind
    you, to make a glass which shall not reflect a single ray of
    light,—a glass so pure and homogeneous in its atoms that
    the rays from the sun will pass through it as they do through
    the air, refracted but not reflected. We do not see the air,
    and yet we feel it."
"That's all very well, Hammond, but these are inanimate
    substances. Glass does not breathe, air does not breathe.
    This thing has a heart that palpitates,—a will
    that moves it,—lungs that play, and inspire and
    respire."
"You forget the phenomena of which we have so often heard of
    late," answered the Doctor, gravely. "At the meetings called
    'spirit circles,' invisible hands have been thrust into the
    hands of those persons round the table,—warm, fleshly
    hands that seemed to pulsate with mortal life."
"What? Do you think, then, that this thing
    is——"
"I don't know what it is," was the solemn reply; "but please
    the gods I will, with your assistance, thoroughly investigate
    it."
We watched together, smoking many pipes, all night long, by
    the bedside of the unearthly being that tossed and panted until
    it was apparently wearied out. Then we learned by the low,
    regular breathing that it slept.
The next morning the house was all astir. The boarders
    congregated on the landing outside my room, and Hammond and
    myself were lions. We had to answer a thousand questions as to
    the state of our extraordinary prisoner, for as yet not one
    person in the house except ourselves could be induced to set
    foot in the apartment.
The creature was awake. This was evidenced by the convulsive
    manner in which the bedclothes were moved in its efforts to
    escape. There was something truly terrible in beholding, as it
    were, those second-hand indications of the terrible writhings
    and agonized struggles for liberty which themselves were
    invisible.
Hammond and myself had racked our brains during the long
    night to discover some means by which we might realize the
    shape and general appearance of the Enigma. As well as we could
    make out by passing our hands over the creature's form, its
    outlines and lineaments were human. There was a mouth; a round,
    smooth head without hair; a nose, which, however, was little
    elevated above the cheeks; and its hands and feet felt like
    those of a boy. At first we thought of placing the being on a
    smooth surface and tracing its outlines with chalk, as
    shoemakers trace the outline of the foot. This plan was given
    up as being of no value. Such an outline would give not the
    slightest idea of its conformation.
A happy thought struck me. We would take a cast of it in
    plaster of Paris. This would give us the solid figure, and
    satisfy all our wishes. But how to do it? The movements of the
    creature would disturb the setting of the plastic covering, and
    distort the mold. Another thought. Why not give it chloroform?
    It had respiratory organs,—that was evident by its
    breathing. Once reduced to a state of insensibility, we could
    do with it what we would. Doctor X—— was sent for;
    and after the worthy physician had recovered from the first
    shock of amazement, he proceeded to administer the chloroform.
    In three minutes afterward we were enabled to remove the
    fetters from the creature's body, and a modeler was busily
    engaged in covering the invisible form with the moist clay. In
    five minutes more we had a mold, and before evening a rough
    facsimile of the Mystery. It was shaped like a
    man—distorted, uncouth, and horrible, but still a man. It
    was small, not over four feet and some inches in height, and
    its limbs revealed a muscular development that was
    unparalleled. Its face surpassed in hideousness anything I had
    ever seen. Gustav Doré, or Callot, or Tony Johannot,
    never conceived anything so horrible. There is a face in one of
    the latter's illustrations to Un Voyage où il vous
    plaira, which somewhat approaches the countenance of this
    creature, but does not equal it. It was the physiognomy of what
    I should fancy a ghoul might be. It looked as if it was capable
    of feeding on human flesh.
Having satisfied our curiosity, and bound every one in the
    house to secrecy, it became a question what was to be done with
    our Enigma? It was impossible that we should keep such a horror
    in our house; it was equally impossible that such an awful
    being should be let loose upon the world. I confess that I
    would have gladly voted for the creature's destruction. But who
    would shoulder the responsibility? Who would undertake the
    execution of this horrible semblance of a human being? Day
    after day this question was deliberated gravely. The boarders
    all left the house. Mrs. Moffat was in despair, and threatened
    Hammond and myself with all sorts of legal penalties if we did
    not remove the Horror. Our answer was, "We will go if you like,
    but we decline taking this creature with us. Remove it yourself
    if you please. It appeared in your house. On you the
    responsibility rests." To this there was, of course, no answer.
    Mrs. Moffat could not obtain for love or money a person who
    would even approach the Mystery.
The most singular part of the affair was that we were
    entirely ignorant of what the creature habitually fed on.
    Everything in the way of nutriment that we could think of was
    placed before it, but was never touched. It was awful to stand
    by, day after day, and see the clothes toss, and hear the hard
    breathing, and know that it was starving.
Ten, twelve days, a fortnight passed, and it still lived.
    The pulsations of the heart, however, were daily growing
    fainter, and had now nearly ceased. It was evident that the
    creature was dying for want of sustenance. While this terrible
    life-struggle was going on, I felt miserable. I could not
    sleep. Horrible as the creature was, it was pitiful to think of
    the pangs it was suffering.
At last it died. Hammond and I found it cold and stiff one
    morning in the bed. The heart had ceased to beat, the lungs to
    inspire. We hastened to bury it in the garden. It was a strange
    funeral, the dropping of that viewless corpse into the damp
    hole. The cast of its form I gave to Doctor X——,
    who keeps it in his museum in Tenth Street.
As I am on the eve of a long journey from which I may not
    return, I have drawn up this narrative of an event the most
    singular that has ever come to my knowledge.

I
It is well known that the old Manton house is haunted. In
    all the rural district near about, and even in the town of
    Marshall, a mile away, not one person of unbiased mind
    entertains a doubt of it; incredulity is confined to those
    opinionated persons who will be called "cranks" as soon as the
    useful word shall have penetrated the intellectual demesne of
    the Marshall Advance. The evidence that the house is
    haunted is of two kinds; the testimony of disinterested
    witnesses who have had ocular proof, and that of the house
    itself. The former may be disregarded and ruled out on any of
    the various grounds of objection which may be urged against it
    by the ingenious; but facts within the observation of all are
    material and controlling.
In the first place the Manton house has been unoccupied by
    mortals for more than ten years, and with its outbuildings is
    slowly falling into decay—a circumstance which in itself
    the judicious will hardly venture to ignore. It stands a little
    way off the loneliest reach of the Marshall and Harriston road,
    in an opening which was once a farm and is still disfigured
    with strips of rotting fence and half covered with brambles
    overrunning a stony and sterile soil long unacquainted with the
    plow. The house itself is in tolerably good condition, though
    badly weather-stained and in dire need of attention from the
    glazier, the smaller male population of the region having
    attested in the manner of its kind its disapproval of dwelling
    without dwellers. It is two stories in height, nearly square,
    its front pierced by a single doorway flanked on each side by a
    window boarded up to the very top. Corresponding windows above,
    not protected, serve to admit light and rain to the rooms of
    the upper floor. Grass and weeds grow pretty rankly all about,
    and a few shade trees, somewhat the worse for wind, and leaning
    all in one direction, seem to be making a concerted effort to
    run away. In short, as the Marshall town humorist explained in
    the columns of the Advance, "the proposition that the
    Manton house is badly haunted is the only logical conclusion
    from the premises." The fact that in this dwelling Mr. Manton
    thought it expedient one night some ten years ago to rise and
    cut the throats of his wife and two small children, removing at
    once to another part of the country, has no doubt done its
    share in directing public attention to the fitness of the place
    for supernatural phenomena.
To this house, one summer evening, came four men in a wagon.
    Three of them promptly alighted, and the one who had been
    driving hitched the team to the only remaining post of what had
    been a fence. The fourth remained seated in the wagon. "Come,"
    said one of his companions, approaching him, while the others
    moved away in the direction of the dwelling—"this is the
    place."
The man addressed did not move. "By God!" he said harshly,
    "this is a trick, and it looks to me as if you were in it."
"Perhaps I am," the other said, looking him straight in the
    face and speaking in a tone which had something of contempt in
    it. "You will remember, however, that the choice of place was
    with your own assent left to the other side. Of course if you
    are afraid of spooks—"
"I am afraid of nothing," the man interrupted with another
    oath, and sprang to the ground. The two then joined the others
    at the door, which one of them had already opened with some
    difficulty, caused by rust of lock and hinge. All entered.
    Inside it was dark, but the man who had unlocked the door
    produced a candle and matches and made a light. He then
    unlocked a door on their right as they stood in the passage.
    This gave them entrance to a large, square room that the candle
    but dimly lighted. The floor had a thick carpeting of dust,
    which partly muffled their footfalls. Cobwebs were in the
    angles of the walls and depended from the ceiling like strips
    of rotting lace making undulatory movements in the disturbed
    air. The room had two windows in adjoining sides, but from
    neither could anything be seen except the rough inner surfaces
    of boards a few inches from the glass. There was no fireplace,
    no furniture; there was nothing: besides the cobwebs and the
    dust, the four men were the only objects there which were not a
    part of the structure.
Strange enough they looked in the yellow light of the
    candle. The one who had so reluctantly alighted was especially
    spectacular—he might have been called sensational. He was
    of middle age, heavily built, deep chested, and broad
    shouldered. Looking at his figure, one would have said that he
    had a giant's strength; at his features, that he would use it
    like a giant. He was clean shaven, his hair rather closely
    cropped and gray. His low forehead was seamed with wrinkles
    above the eyes, and over the nose these became vertical. The
    heavy black brows followed the same law, saved from meeting
    only by an upward turn at what would otherwise have been the
    point of contact. Deeply sunken beneath these, glowed in the
    obscure light a pair of eyes of uncertain color, but obviously
    enough too small. There was something forbidding in their
    expression, which was not bettered by the cruel mouth and wide
    jaw. The nose was well enough, as noses go; one does not expect
    much of noses. All that was sinister in the man's face seemed
    accentuated by an unnatural pallor—he appeared altogether
    bloodless.
The appearance of the other men was sufficiently
    commonplace; they were such persons as one meets and forgets
    that he met. All were younger than the man described, between
    whom and the eldest of the others, who stood apart, there was
    apparently no kindly feeling. They avoided looking at each
    other.
"Gentlemen," said the man holding the candle and keys, "I
    believe everything is right. Are you ready, Mr. Rosser?"
The man standing apart from the group bowed and smiled.
"And you, Mr. Grossmith?"
The heavy man bowed and scowled.
"You will be pleased to remove your outer clothing."
Their hats, coats, waistcoats, and neckwear were soon
    removed and thrown outside the door, in the passage. The man
    with the candle now nodded, and the fourth man—he who had
    urged Grossmith to leave the wagon—produced from the
    pocket of his overcoat two long, murderous-looking
    bowie-knives, which he drew now from their leather
    scabbards.
"They are exactly alike," he said, presenting one to each of
    the two principals—for by this time the dullest observer
    would have understood the nature of this meeting. It was to be
    a duel to the death.
Each combatant took a knife, examined it critically near the
    candle and tested the strength of the blade and handle across
    his lifted knee. Their persons were then searched in turn, each
    by the second of the other.
"If it is agreeable to you, Mr. Grossmith," said the man
    holding the light, "you will place yourself in that
    corner."
He indicated the angle of the room farthest from the door,
    whither Grossmith retired, his second parting from him with a
    grasp of the hand which had nothing of cordiality in it. In the
    angle nearest the door Mr. Rosser stationed himself, and after
    a whispered consultation his second left him, joining the other
    near the door. At that moment the candle was suddenly
    extinguished, leaving all in profound darkness. This may have
    been done by a draught from the opened door; whatever the
    cause, the effect was startling.
"Gentlemen," said a voice which sounded strangely unfamiliar
    in the altered condition affecting the relations of the
    senses—"gentlemen, you will not move until you hear the
    closing of the outer door."
A sound of trampling ensued, then the closing of the inner
    door; and finally the outer one closed with a concussion which
    shook the entire building.
A few minutes afterward a belated farmer's boy met a light
    wagon which was being driven furiously toward the town of
    Marshall. He declared that behind the two figures on the front
    seat stood a third, with its hands upon the bowed shoulders of
    the others, who appeared to struggle vainly to free themselves
    from its grasp. This figure, unlike the others, was clad in
    white, and had undoubtedly boarded the wagon as it passed the
    haunted house. As the lad could boast a considerable former
    experience with the supernatural thereabouts his word had the
    weight justly due to the testimony of an expert. The story (in
    connection with the next day's events) eventually appeared in
    the Advance, with some slight literary embellishments
    and a concluding intimation that the gentlemen referred to
    would be allowed the use of the paper's columns for their
    version of the night's adventure. But the privilege remained
    without a claimant.
II
The events that led up to this "duel in the dark" were
    simple enough. One evening three young men of the town of
    Marshall were sitting in a quiet corner of the porch of the
    village hotel, smoking and discussing such matters as three
    educated young men of a Southern village would naturally find
    interesting. Their names were King, Sancher, and Rosser. At a
    little distance, within easy hearing, but taking no part in the
    conversation, sat a fourth. He was a stranger to the others.
    They merely knew that on his arrival by the stage-coach that
    afternoon he had written in the hotel register the name of
    Robert Grossmith. He had not been observed to speak to anyone
    except the hotel clerk. He seemed, indeed, singularly fond of
    his own company—or, as the personnel of the
    Advance expressed it, "grossly addicted to evil
    associations." But then it should be said in justice to the
    stranger that the personnel was himself of a too
    convivial disposition fairly to judge one differently gifted,
    and had, moreover, experienced a slight rebuff in an effort at
    an "interview."
"I hate any kind of deformity in a woman," said King,
    "whether natural or—acquired. I have a theory that any
    physical defect has its correlative mental and moral
    defect."
"I infer, then," said Rosser, gravely, "that a lady lacking
    the moral advantage of a nose would find the struggle to become
    Mrs. King an arduous enterprise."
"Of course you may put it that way," was the reply; "but,
    seriously, I once threw over a most charming girl on learning
    quite accidentally that she had suffered amputation of a toe.
    My conduct was brutal if you like, but if I had married that
    girl I should have been miserable for life and should have made
    her so."
"Whereas," said Sancher, with a light laugh, "by marrying a
    gentleman of more liberal view she escaped with a parted
    throat."
"Ah, you know to whom I refer. Yes, she married Manton, but
    I don't know about his liberality; I'm not sure but he cut her
    throat because he discovered that she lacked that excellent
    thing in woman, the middle toe of the right foot."
"Look at that chap!" said Rosser in a low voice, his eyes
    fixed upon the stranger.
That chap was obviously listening intently to the
    conversation.
"Damn his impudence!" muttered King—"what ought we to
    do?"
"That's an easy one," Rosser replied, rising. "Sir," he
    continued, addressing the stranger, "I think it would be better
    if you would remove your chair to the other end of the veranda.
    The presence of gentlemen is evidently an unfamiliar situation
    to you."
The man sprang to his feet and strode forward with clenched
    hands, his face white with rage. All were now standing. Sancher
    stepped between the belligerents.
"You are hasty and unjust," he said to Rosser; "this
    gentleman has done nothing to deserve such language."
But Rosser would not withdraw a word. By the custom of the
    country and the time there could be but one outcome to the
    quarrel.
"I demand the satisfaction due to a gentleman," said the
    stranger, who had become more calm. "I have not an acquaintance
    in this region. Perhaps you, sir," bowing to Sancher, "will be
    kind enough to represent me in this matter."
Sancher accepted the trust—somewhat reluctantly it
    must be confessed, for the man's appearance and manner were not
    at all to his liking. King, who during the colloquy had hardly
    removed his eyes from the stranger's face and had not spoken a
    word, consented with a nod to act for Rosser, and the upshot of
    it was that, the principals having retired, a meeting was
    arranged for the next evening. The nature of the arrangements
    has been already disclosed. The duel with knives in a dark room
    was once a commoner feature of Southwestern life than it is
    likely to be again. How thin a veneering of "chivalry" covered
    the essential brutality of the code under which such encounters
    were possible we shall see.
III
In the blaze of a midsummer noonday the old Manton house was
    hardly true to its traditions. It was of the earth, earthy. The
    sunshine caressed it warmly and affectionately, with evident
    disregard of its bad reputation. The grass greening all the
    expanse in its front seemed to grow, not rankly, but with a
    natural and joyous exuberance, and the weeds blossomed quite
    like plants. Full of charming lights and shadows and populous
    with pleasant-voiced birds, the neglected shade trees no longer
    struggled to run away, but bent reverently beneath their
    burdens of sun and song. Even in the glassless upper windows
    was an expression of peace and contentment, due to the light
    within. Over the stony fields the visible heat danced with a
    lively tremor incompatible with the gravity which is an
    attribute of the supernatural.
Such was the aspect under which the place presented itself
    to Sheriff Adams and two other men who had come out from
    Marshall to look at it. One of these men was Mr. King, the
    sheriff's deputy; the other, whose name was Brewer, was a
    brother of the late Mrs. Manton. Under a beneficent law of the
    State relating to property which has been for a certain period
    abandoned by an owner whose residence cannot be ascertained,
    the sheriff was legal custodian of the Manton farm and
    appurtenances thereunto belonging. His present visit was in
    mere perfunctory compliance with some order of a court in which
    Mr. Brewer had an action to get possession of the property as
    heir to his deceased sister. By a mere coincidence, the visit
    was made on the day after the night that Deputy King had
    unlocked the house for another and very different purpose. His
    presence now was not of his own choosing: he had been ordered
    to accompany his superior, and at the moment could think of
    nothing more prudent than simulated alacrity in obedience to
    the command.
Carelessly opening the front door, which to his surprise was
    not locked, the sheriff was amazed to see, lying on the floor
    of the passage into which it opened, a confused heap of men's
    apparel. Examination showed it to consist of two hats, and the
    same number of coats, waistcoats, and scarves all in a
    remarkably good state of preservation, albeit somewhat defiled
    by the dust in which they lay. Mr. Brewer was equally
    astonished, but Mr. King's emotion is not of record. With a new
    and lively interest in his own actions the sheriff now
    unlatched and pushed open a door on the right, and the three
    entered. The room was apparently vacant—no; as their eyes
    became accustomed to the dimmer light something was visible in
    the farthest angle of the wall. It was a human
    figure—that of a man crouching close in the corner.
    Something in the attitude made the intruders halt when they had
    barely passed the threshold. The figure more and more clearly
    defined itself. The man was upon one knee, his back in the
    angle of the wall, his shoulders elevated to the level of his
    ears, his hands before his face, palms outward, the fingers
    spread and crooked like claws; the white face turned upward on
    the retracted neck had an expression of unutterable fright, the
    mouth half open, the eyes incredibly expanded. He was stone
    dead. Yet with the exception of a bowie-knife, which had
    evidently fallen from his own hand, not another object was in
    the room.
In thick dust that covered the floor were some confused
    footprints near the door and along the wall through which it
    opened. Along one of the adjoining walls, too, past the
    boarded-up windows was the trail made by the man himself in
    reaching his corner. Instinctively in approaching the body the
    three men followed that trail. The sheriff grasped one of the
    outthrown arms; it was as rigid as iron, and the application of
    a gentle force rocked the entire body without altering the
    relation of its parts. Brewer, pale with excitement, gazed
    intently into the distorted face. "God of mercy!" he suddenly
    cried, "it is Manton!"
"You are right," said King, with an evident attempt at
    calmness: "I knew Manton. He then wore a full beard and his
    hair long, but this is he."
He might have added: "I recognized him when he challenged
    Rosser. I told Rosser and Sancher who he was before we played
    him this horrible trick. When Rosser left this dark room at our
    heels, forgetting his outer clothing in the excitement, and
    driving away with us in his shirt sleeves—all through the
    discreditable proceedings we knew with whom we were dealing,
    murderer and coward that he was!"
But nothing of this did Mr. King say. With his better light
    he was trying to penetrate the mystery of the man's death. That
    he had not once moved from the corner where he had been
    stationed; that his posture was that of neither attack nor
    defense; that he had dropped his weapon; that he had obviously
    perished of sheer horror of something that he
    saw—these were circumstances which Mr. King's
    disturbed intelligence could not rightly comprehend.
Groping in intellectual darkness for a clew to his maze of
    doubt, his gaze, directed mechanically downward in the way of
    one who ponders momentous matters, fell upon something which,
    there, in the light of day and in the presence of living
    companions, affected him with terror. In the dust of years that
    lay thick upon the floor—leading from the door by which
    they had entered, straight across the room to within a yard of
    Manton's crouching corpse—were three parallel lines of
    footprints—light but definite impressions of bare feet,
    the outer ones those of small children, the inner a woman's.
    From the point at which they ended they did not return; they
    pointed all one way. Brewer, who had observed them at the same
    moment, was leaning forward in an attitude of rapt attention,
    horribly pale.
"Look at that!" he cried, pointing with both hands at the
    nearest print of the woman's right foot, where she had
    apparently stopped and stood. "The middle toe is
    missing—it was Gertrude!"
Gertrude was the late Mrs. Manton, sister to Mr. Brewer.

The Shell of Sense
By OLIVIA HOWARD DUNBAR

From Harper's Magazine, December, 1908. By permission of
        Harper and Brothers and Olivia Howard Dunbar.

It was intolerably unchanged, the dim, dark-toned room. In
    an agony of recognition my glance ran from one to another of
    the comfortable, familiar things that my earthly life had been
    passed among. Incredibly distant from it all as I essentially
    was. I noted sharply that the very gaps that I myself had left
    in my bookshelves still stood unfilled; that the delicate
    fingers of the ferns that I had tended were still stretched
    futilely toward the light; that the soft agreeable chuckle of
    my own little clock, like some elderly woman with whom
    conversation has become automatic, was undiminished.
Unchanged—or so it seemed at first. But there were
    certain trivial differences that shortly smote me. The windows
    were closed too tightly; for I had always kept the house very
    cool, although I had known that Theresa preferred warm rooms.
    And my work-basket was in disorder; it was preposterous that so
    small a thing should hurt me so. Then, for this was my first
    experience of the shadow-folded transition, the odd alteration
    of my emotions bewildered me. For at one moment the place
    seemed so humanly familiar, so distinctly my own proper
    envelope, that for love of it I could have laid my cheek
    against the wall; while in the next I was miserably conscious
    of strange new shrillnesses. How could they be
    endured—and had I ever endured them?—those harsh
    influences that I now perceived at the window; light and color
    so blinding that they obscured the form of the wind, tumult so
    discordant that one could scarcely hear the roses open in the
    garden below?
But Theresa did not seem to mind any of these things.
    Disorder, it is true, the dear child had never minded. She was
    sitting all this time at my desk—at my
    desk—occupied, I could only too easily surmise how. In
    the light of my own habits of precision it was plain that that
    sombre correspondence should have been attended to before; but
    I believe that I did not really reproach Theresa, for I knew
    that her notes, when she did write them, were perhaps less
    perfunctory than mine. She finished the last one as I watched
    her, and added it to the heap of black-bordered envelopes that
    lay on the desk. Poor girl! I saw now that they had cost her
    tears. Yet, living beside her day after day, year after year, I
    had never discovered what deep tenderness my sister possessed.
    Toward each other it had been our habit to display only a
    temperate affection, and I remember having always thought it
    distinctly fortunate for Theresa, since she was denied my
    happiness, that she could live so easily and pleasantly without
    emotions of the devastating sort.... And now, for the first
    time, I was really to behold her.... Could it be Theresa, after
    all, this tangle of subdued turbulences? Let no one suppose
    that it is an easy thing to bear, the relentlessly lucid
    understanding that I then first exercised; or that, in its
    first enfranchisement, the timid vision does not yearn for its
    old screens and mists.
Suddenly, as Theresa sat there, her head, filled with its
    tender thoughts of me, held in her gentle hands, I felt Allan's
    step on the carpeted stair outside. Theresa felt it,
    too,—but how? for it was not audible. She gave a start,
    swept the black envelopes out of sight, and pretended to be
    writing in a little book. Then I forgot to watch her any longer
    in my absorption in Allan's coming. It was he, of course, that
    I was awaiting. It was for him that I had made this first
    lonely, frightened effort to return, to recover.... It was not
    that I had supposed he would allow himself to recognize my
    presence, for I had long been sufficiently familiar with his
    hard and fast denials of the invisible. He was so reasonable
    always, so sane—so blindfolded. But I had hoped that
    because of his very rejection of the ether that now contained
    me I could perhaps all the more safely, the more secretly,
    watch him, linger near him. He was near now, very
    near,—but why did Theresa, sitting there in the room that
    had never belonged to her, appropriate for herself his coming?
    It was so manifestly I who had drawn him, I whom he had come to
    seek.
The door was ajar. He knocked softly at it "Are you there,
    Theresa?" he called. He expected to find her, then, there in my
    room? I shrank back, fearing, almost, to stay.
"I shall have finished in a moment," Theresa told him, and
    he sat down to wait for her.
No spirit still unreleased can understand the pang that I
    felt with Allan sitting almost within my touch. Almost
    irresistibly the wish beset me to let him for an instant feel
    my nearness. Then I checked myself, remembering—oh,
    absurd, piteous human fears!—that my too unguarded
    closeness might alarm him. It was not so remote a time that I
    myself had known them, those blind, uncouth timidities. I came,
    therefore, somewhat nearer—but I did not touch him. I
    merely leaned toward him and with incredible softness whispered
    his name. That much I could not have forborne; the spell of
    life was still too strong in me.
But it gave him no comfort, no delight. "Theresa!" he
    called, in a voice dreadful with alarm—and in that
    instant the last veil fell, and desperately, scarce
    believingly, I beheld how it stood between them, those two.
She turned to him that gentle look of hers.
"Forgive me," came from him hoarsely. "But I had suddenly
    the most—unaccountable sensation. Can there be too many
    windows open? There is such a—chill—about."
"There are no windows open," Theresa assured him. "I took
    care to shut out the chill. You are not well, Allan!"
"Perhaps not." He embraced the suggestion. "And yet I feel
    no illness apart from this abominable sensation that
    persists—persists.... Theresa, you must tell me: do I
    fancy it, or do you, too, feel—something—strange
    here?"
"Oh, there is something very strange here," she half sobbed.
    "There always will be."
"Good heavens, child, I didn't mean that!" He rose and stood
    looking about him. "I know, of course, that you have your
    beliefs, and I respect them, but you know equally well that I
    have nothing of the sort! So—don't let us conjure up
    anything inexplicable."
I stayed impalpably, imponderably near him. Wretched and
    bereft though I was, I could not have left him while he stood
    denying me.
"What I mean," he went on, in his low, distinct voice, "is a
    special, an almost ominous sense of cold. Upon my soul,
    Theresa,"—he paused—"if I were
    superstitious, if I were a woman, I should probably
    imagine it to seem—a presence!"
He spoke the last word very faintly, but Theresa shrank from
    it nevertheless.
"Don't say that, Allan!" she cried out. "Don't
    think it, I beg of you! I've tried so hard myself not to think
    it—and you must help me. You know it is only perturbed,
    uneasy spirits that wander. With her it is quite different. She
    has always been so happy—she must still be."
I listened, stunned, to Theresa's sweet dogmatism. From what
    blind distances came her confident misapprehensions, how dense,
    both for her and for Allan, was the separating vapor!
Allan frowned. "Don't take me literally, Theresa," he
    explained; and I, who a moment before had almost touched him,
    now held myself aloof and heard him with a strange untried
    pity, new born in me. "I'm not speaking of what you
    call—spirits. It's something much more terrible." He
    allowed his head to sink heavily on his chest. "If I did not
    positively know that I had never done her any harm, I should
    suppose myself to be suffering from guilt, from remorse....
    Theresa, you know better than I, perhaps. Was she content,
    always? Did she believe in me?"
"Believe in you?—when she knew you to be so
    good!—when you adored her!"
"She thought that? She said it? Then what in Heaven's name
    ails me?—unless it is all as you believe, Theresa, and
    she knows now what she didn't know then, poor dear, and
    minds——"
"Minds what? What do you mean, Allan?"
I, who with my perhaps illegitimate advantage saw so clear,
    knew that he had not meant to tell her: I did him that justice,
    even in my first jealousy. If I had not tortured him so by
    clinging near him, he would not have told her. But the moment
    came, and overflowed, and he did tell her—passionate,
    tumultuous story that it was. During all our life together,
    Allan's and mine, he had spared me, had kept me wrapped in the
    white cloak of an unblemished loyalty. But it would have been
    kinder, I now bitterly thought, if, like many husbands, he had
    years ago found for the story he now poured forth some
    clandestine listener; I should not have known. But he was
    faithful and good, and so he waited till I, mute and chained,
    was there to hear him. So well did I know him, as I thought, so
    thoroughly had he once been mine, that I saw it in his eyes,
    heard it in his voice, before the words came. And yet, when it
    came, it lashed me with the whips of an unbearable humiliation.
    For I, his wife, had not known how greatly he could love.
And that Theresa, soft little traitor, should, in her still
    way, have cared too! Where was the iron in her, I moaned within
    my stricken spirit, where the steadfastness? From the moment he
    bade her, she turned her soft little petals up to him—and
    my last delusion was spent. It was intolerable; and none the
    less so that in another moment she had, prompted by some
    belated thought of me, renounced him. Allan was hers, yet she
    put him from her; and it was my part to watch them both.
Then in the anguish of it all I remembered, awkward,
    untutored spirit that I was, that I now had the Great Recourse.
    Whatever human things were unbearable, I had no need to bear. I
    ceased, therefore, to make the effort that kept me with them.
    The pitiless poignancy was dulled, the sounds and the light
    ceased, the lovers faded from me, and again I was mercifully
    drawn into the dim, infinite spaces.

There followed a period whose length I cannot measure and
    during which I was able to make no progress in the difficult,
    dizzying experience of release. "Earth-bound" my jealousy
    relentlessly kept me. Though my two dear ones had forsworn each
    other, I could not trust them, for theirs seemed to me an
    affectation of a more than mortal magnanimity. Without a
    ghostly sentinel to prick them with sharp fears and
    recollections, who could believe that they would keep to it? Of
    the efficacy of my own vigilance, so long as I might choose to
    exercise it, I could have no doubt, for I had by this time come
    to have a dreadful exultation in the new power that lived in
    me. Repeated delicate experiment had taught me how a touch or a
    breath, a wish or a whisper, could control Allan's acts, could
    keep him from Theresa. I could manifest myself as palely, as
    transiently, as a thought. I could produce the merest necessary
    flicker, like the shadow of a just-opened leaf, on his
    trembling, tortured consciousness. And these unrealized
    perceptions of me he interpreted, as I had known that he would,
    as his soul's inevitable penance. He had come to believe that
    he had done evil in silently loving Theresa all these years,
    and it was my vengeance to allow him to believe this, to prod
    him ever to believe it afresh.
I am conscious that this frame of mind was not continuous in
    me. For I remember, too, that when Allan and Theresa were
    safely apart and sufficiently miserable I loved them as dearly
    as I ever had, more dearly perhaps. For it was impossible that
    I should not perceive, in my new emancipation, that they were,
    each of them, something more and greater than the two beings I
    had once ignorantly pictured them. For years they had practiced
    a selflessness of which I could once scarcely have conceived,
    and which even now I could only admire without entering into
    its mystery. While I had lived solely for myself, these two
    divine creatures had lived exquisitely for me. They had granted
    me everything, themselves nothing. For my undeserving sake
    their lives had been a constant torment of renunciation—a
    torment they had not sought to alleviate by the exchange of a
    single glance of understanding. There were even marvelous
    moments when, from the depths of my newly informed heart, I
    pitied them—poor creatures, who, withheld from the
    infinite solaces that I had come to know, were still utterly
    within that


Shell of sense
So frail, so piteously contrived for pain.


Within it, yes; yet exercising qualities that so sublimely
    transcended it. Yet the shy, hesitating compassion that thus
    had birth in me was far from being able to defeat the earlier,
    earthlier emotion. The two, I recognized, were in a sort of
    conflict; and I, regarding it, assumed that the conflict would
    never end; that for years, as Allan and Theresa reckoned time,
    I should be obliged to withhold myself from the great spaces
    and linger suffering, grudging, shamed, where they
    lingered.

It can never have been explained, I suppose, what, to
    devitalized perception such as mine, the contact of mortal
    beings with each other appears to be. Once to have exercised
    this sense-freed perception is to realize that the gift of
    prophecy, although the subject of such frequent marvel, is no
    longer mysterious. The merest glance of our sensitive and
    uncloyed vision can detect the strength of the relation between
    two beings, and therefore instantly calculate its duration. If
    you see a heavy weight suspended from a slender string, you can
    know, without any wizardry, that in a few moments the string
    will snap; well, such, if you admit the analogy, is prophecy,
    is foreknowledge. And it was thus that I saw it with Theresa
    and Allan. For it was perfectly visible to me that they would
    very little longer have the strength to preserve, near each
    other, the denuded impersonal relation that they, and that I,
    behind them, insisted on; and that they would have to separate.
    It was my sister, perhaps the more sensitive, who first
    realized this. It had now become possible for me to observe
    them almost constantly, the effort necessary to visit them had
    so greatly diminished; so that I watched her, poor, anguished
    girl, prepare to leave him. I saw each reluctant movement that
    she made. I saw her eyes, worn from self-searching; I heard her
    step grown timid from inexplicable fears; I entered her very
    heart and heard its pitiful, wild beating. And still I did not
    interfere.
For at this time I had a wonderful, almost demoniacal sense
    of disposing of matters to suit my own selfish will. At any
    moment I could have checked their miseries, could have restored
    happiness and peace. Yet it gave me, and I could weep to admit
    it, a monstrous joy to know that Theresa thought she was
    leaving Allan of her own free intention, when it was I who was
    contriving, arranging, insisting.... And yet she wretchedly
    felt my presence near her; I am certain of that.
A few days before the time of her intended departure my
    sister told Allan that she must speak with him after dinner.
    Our beautiful old house branched out from a circular hall with
    great arched doors at either end; and it was through the rear
    doorway that always in summer, after dinner, we passed out into
    the garden adjoining. As usual, therefore, when the hour came,
    Theresa led the way. That dreadful daytime brilliance that in
    my present state I found so hard to endure was now becoming
    softer. A delicate, capricious twilight breeze danced
    inconsequently through languidly whispering leaves. Lovely pale
    flowers blossomed like little moons in the dusk, and over them
    the breath of mignonette hung heavily. It was a perfect
    place—and it had so long been ours, Allan's and mine. It
    made me restless and a little wicked that those two should be
    there together now.
For a little they walked about together, speaking of common,
    daily things. Then suddenly Theresa burst out:
"I am going away, Allan. I have stayed to do everything that
    needed to be done. Now your mother will be here to care for
    you, and it is time for me to go."
He stared at her and stood still. Theresa had been there so
    long, she so definitely, to his mind, belonged there. And she
    was, as I also had jealously known, so lovely there, the small,
    dark, dainty creature, in the old hall, on the wide staircases,
    in the garden.... Life there without Theresa, even the
    intentionally remote, the perpetually renounced
    Theresa—he had not dreamed of it, he could not, so
    suddenly, conceive of it.
"Sit here," he said, and drew her down beside him on a
    bench, "and tell me what it means, why you are going. Is it
    because of something that I have been—have done?"
She hesitated. I wondered if she would dare tell him. She
    looked out and away from him, and he waited long for her to
    speak.
The pale stars were sliding into their places. The
    whispering of the leaves was almost hushed. All about them it
    was still and shadowy and sweet. It was that wonderful moment
    when, for lack of a visible horizon, the not yet darkened world
    seems infinitely greater—a moment when anything can
    happen, anything be believed in. To me, watching, listening,
    hovering, there came a dreadful purpose and a dreadful courage.
    Suppose for one moment, Theresa should not only feel, but
    see me—would she dare to tell him then?
There came a brief space of terrible effort, all my
    fluttering, uncertain forces strained to the utmost. The
    instant of my struggle was endlessly long and the transition
    seemed to take place outside me—as one sitting in a
    train, motionless, sees the leagues of earth float by. And
    then, in a bright, terrible flash I knew I had achieved
    it—I had attained visibility. Shuddering,
    insubstantial, but luminously apparent, I stood there before
    them. And for the instant that I maintained the visible state I
    looked straight into Theresa's soul.
She gave a cry. And then, thing of silly, cruel impulses
    that I was, I saw what I had done. The very thing that I wished
    to avert I had precipitated. For Allan, in his sudden terror
    and pity, had bent and caught her in his arms. For the first
    time they were together; and it was I who had brought them.
Then, to his whispered urging to tell the reason of her cry,
    Theresa said:
"Frances was here. You did not see her, standing there,
    under the lilacs, with no smile on her face?"
"My dear, my dear!" was all that Allan said. I had so long
    now lived invisibly with them, he knew that she was right.
"I suppose you know what it means?" she asked him,
    calmly.
"Dear Theresa," Allan said, slowly, "if you and I should go
    away somewhere, could we not evade all this ghostliness? And
    will you come with me?"
"Distance would not banish her," my sister confidently
    asserted. And then she said, softly: "Have you thought what a
    lonely, awesome thing it must be to be so newly dead? Pity her,
    Allan. We who are warm and alive should pity her. She loves you
    still,—that is the meaning of it all, you know—and
    she wants us to understand that for that reason we must keep
    apart. Oh, it was so plain in her white face as she stood
    there. And you did not see her?"
"It was your face that I saw," Allan solemnly told
    her—oh, how different he had grown from the Allan that I
    had known!—"and yours is the only face that I shall ever
    see." And again he drew her to him.
She sprang from him. "You are defying her, Allan!" she
    cried. "And you must not. It is her right to keep us apart, if
    she wishes. It must be as she insists. I shall go, as I told
    you. And, Allan, I beg of you, leave me the courage to do as
    she demands!"
They stood facing each other in the deep dusk, and the
    wounds that I had dealt them gaped red and accusing. "We must
    pity her," Theresa had said. And as I remembered that
    extraordinary speech, and saw the agony in her face, and the
    greater agony in Allan's, there came the great irreparable
    cleavage between mortality and me. In a swift, merciful flame
    the last of my mortal emotions—gross and tenacious they
    must have been—was consumed. My cold grasp of Allan
    loosened and a new unearthly love of him bloomed in my
    heart.
I was now, however, in a difficulty with which my experience
    in the newer state was scarcely sufficient to deal. How could I
    make it plain to Allan and Theresa that I wished to bring them
    together, to heal the wounds that I had made?
Pityingly, remorsefully, I lingered near them all that night
    and the next day. And by that time had brought myself to the
    point of a great determination. In the little time that was
    left, before Theresa should be gone and Allan bereft and
    desolate, I saw the one way that lay open to me to convince
    them of my acquiescence in their destiny.
In the deepest darkness and silence of the next night I made
    a greater effort than it will ever be necessary for me to make
    again. When they think of me, Allan and Theresa, I pray now
    that they will recall what I did that night, and that my
    thousand frustrations and selfishnesses may shrivel and be
    blown from their indulgent memories.
Yet the following morning, as she had planned, Theresa
    appeared at breakfast dressed for her journey. Above in her
    room there were the sounds of departure. They spoke little
    during the brief meal, but when it was ended Allan said:
"Theresa, there is half an hour before you go. Will you come
    upstairs with me? I had a dream that I must tell you of."
"Allan!" She looked at him, frightened, but went with him.
    "It was of Frances you dreamed," she said, quietly, as they
    entered the library together.
"Did I say it was a dream? But I was awake—thoroughly
    awake. I had not been sleeping well, and I heard, twice, the
    striking of the clock. And as I lay there, looking out at the
    stars, and thinking—thinking of you, Theresa,—she
    came to me, stood there before me, in my room. It was no
    sheeted specter, you understand; it was Frances, literally she.
    In some inexplicable fashion I seemed to be aware that she
    wanted to make me know something, and I waited, watching her
    face. After a few moments it came. She did not speak,
    precisely. That is, I am sure I heard no sound. Yet the words
    that came from her were definite enough. She said: 'Don't let
    Theresa leave you. Take her and keep her.' Then she went away.
    Was that a dream?"
"I had not meant to tell you," Theresa eagerly answered,
    "but now I must. It is too wonderful. What time did your clock
    strike, Allan?"
"One, the last time."
"Yes; it was then that I awoke. And she had been with me. I
    had not seen her, but her arm had been about me and her kiss
    was on my cheek. Oh. I knew; it was unmistakable. And the sound
    of her voice was with me."
"Then she bade you, too——"
"Yes, to stay with you. I am glad we told each other." She
    smiled tearfully and began to fasten her wrap.
"But you are not going—now!" Allan cried.
    "You know that you cannot, now that she has asked you to
    stay."
"Then you believe, as I do, that it was she?" Theresa
    demanded.
"I can never understand, but I know," he answered her. "And
    now you will not go?"

I am freed. There will be no further semblance of me in my
    old home, no sound of my voice, no dimmest echo of my earthly
    self. They have no further need of me, the two that I have
    brought together. Theirs is the fullest joy that the dwellers
    in the shell of sense can know. Mine is the transcendent joy of
    the unseen spaces.

I tell you sir, I was innocent. I didn't know any more about
    the world at twenty-two than some do at twelve. My uncle and
    aunt in Duxbury brought me up strict; I studied hard in high
    school, I worked hard after hours, and I went to church twice
    on Sundays, and I can't see it's right to put me in a place
    like this, with crazy people. Oh yes, I know they're
    crazy—you can't tell me. As for what they said
    in court about finding her with her husband, that's the
    Inspector's lie, sir, because he's down on me, and wants to
    make it look like my fault.
No, sir, I can't say as I thought she was handsome—not
    at first. For one thing, her lips were too thin and white, and
    her color was bad. I'll tell you a fact, sir; that first day I
    came off to the Light I was sitting on my cot in the store-room
    (that's where the assistant keeper sleeps at the Seven
    Brothers), as lonesome as I could be, away from home for the
    first time, and the water all around me, and, even though it
    was a calm day, pounding enough on the ledge to send a kind of
    a woom-woom-woom whining up through all that solid
    rock of the tower. And when old Fedderson poked his head down
    from the living-room with the sunshine above making a kind of
    bright frame around his hair and whiskers, to give me a cheery,
    "Make yourself to home, son!" I remember I said to myself:
    "He's all right. I'll get along with him. But
    his wife's enough to sour milk." That was queer, because she
    was so much under him in age—'long about twenty-eight or
    so, and him nearer fifty. But that's what I said, sir.
Of course that feeling wore off, same as any feeling will
    wear off sooner or later in a place like the Seven Brothers.
    Cooped up in a place like that you come to know folks so well
    that you forget what they do look like. There was a
    long time I never noticed her, any more than you'd notice the
    cat. We used to sit of an evening around the table, as if you
    were Fedderson there, and me here, and her somewhere back
    there, in the rocker, knitting. Fedderson would be working on
    his Jacob's-ladder, and I'd be reading. He'd been working on
    that Jacob's-ladder a year, I guess, and every time the
    Inspector came off with the tender he was so astonished to see
    how good that ladder was that the old man would go to work and
    make it better. That's all he lived for.
If I was reading, as I say, I daren't take my eyes off the
    book, or Fedderson had me. And then he'd begin—what the
    Inspector said about him. How surprised the member of the board
    had been, that time, to see everything so clean about the
    light. What the Inspector had said about Fedderson's being
    stuck here in a second-class light—best keeper on the
    coast. And so on and so on, till either he or I had to go aloft
    and have a look at the wicks.
He'd been there twenty-three years, all told, and he'd got
    used to the feeling that he was kept down unfair—so used
    to it, I guess, that he fed on it, and told himself how folks
    ashore would talk when he was dead and gone—best keeper
    on the coast—kept down unfair. Not that he said that to
    me. No, he was far too loyal and humble and respectful, doing
    his duty without complaint, as anybody could see.
And all that time, night after night, hardly ever a word out
    of the woman. As I remember it, she seemed more like a piece of
    furniture than anything else—not even a very good cook,
    nor over and above tidy. One day, when he and I were trimming
    the lamp, he passed the remark that his first wife
    used to dust the lens and take a pride in it. Not that he said
    a word against Anna, though. He never said a word against any
    living mortal; he was too upright.
I don't know how it came about; or, rather, I do
    know, but it was so sudden, and so far away from my thoughts,
    that it shocked me, like the world turned over. It was at
    prayers. That night I remember Fedderson was uncommon
    long-winded. We'd had a batch of newspapers out by the tender,
    and at such times the old man always made a long watch of it,
    getting the world straightened out. For one thing, the United
    States minister to Turkey was dead. Well, from him and his
    soul, Fedderson got on to Turkey and the Presbyterian college
    there, and from that to heathen in general. He rambled on and
    on, like the surf on the ledge, woom-woom-woom, never
    coming to an end.
You know how you'll be at prayers sometimes. My mind
    strayed. I counted the canes in the chair-seat where I was
    kneeling; I plaited a corner of the table-cloth between my
    fingers for a spell, and by and by my eyes went wandering up
    the back of the chair.
The woman, sir, was looking at me. Her chair was back to
    mine, close, and both our heads were down in the shadow under
    the edge of the table, with Fedderson clear over on the other
    side by the stove. And there were her two eyes hunting mine
    between the spindles in the shadow. You won't believe me, sir,
    but I tell you I felt like jumping to my feet and running out
    of the room—it was so queer.
I don't know what her husband was praying about after that.
    His voice didn't mean anything, no more than the seas on the
    ledge away down there. I went to work to count the canes in the
    seat again, but all my eyes were in the top of my head. It got
    so I couldn't stand it. We were at the Lord's prayer, saying it
    singsong together, when I had to look up again. And there her
    two eyes were, between the spindles, hunting mine. Just then
    all of us were saying, "Forgive us our trespasses—" I
    thought of it afterward.
When we got up she was turned the other way, but I couldn't
    help seeing her cheeks were red. It was terrible. I wondered if
    Fedderson would notice, though I might have known he
    wouldn't—not him. He was in too much of a hurry to get at
    his Jacob's-ladder, and then he had to tell me for the tenth
    time what the Inspector'd said that day about getting him
    another light—Kingdom Come, maybe, he said.
I made some excuse or other and got away. Once in the
    store-room, I sat down on my cot and stayed there a long time,
    feeling queerer than anything. I read a chapter in the Bible, I
    don't know why. After I'd got my boots off I sat with them in
    my hands for as much as an hour, I guess, staring at the
    oil-tank and its lopsided shadow on the wall. I tell you, sir,
    I was shocked. I was only twenty-two remember, and I was
    shocked and horrified.
And when I did turn in, finally, I didn't sleep at all well.
    Two or three times I came to, sitting straight up in bed. Once
    I got up and opened the outer door to have a look. The water
    was like glass, dim, without a breath of wind, and the moon
    just going down. Over on the black shore I made out two lights
    in a village, like a pair of eyes watching. Lonely? My, yes!
    Lonely and nervous. I had a horror of her, sir. The dinghy-boat
    hung on its davits just there in front of the door, and for a
    minute I had an awful hankering to climb into it, lower away,
    and row off, no matter where. It sounds foolish.
Well, it seemed foolish next morning, with the sun shining
    and everything as usual—Fedderson sucking his pen and
    wagging his head over his eternal "log," and his wife down in
    the rocker with her head in the newspaper, and her breakfast
    work still waiting. I guess that jarred it out of me more than
    anything else—sight of her slouched down there, with her
    stringy, yellow hair and her dusty apron and the pale back of
    her neck, reading the Society Notes. Society Notes!
    Think of it! For the first time since I came to Seven Brothers
    I wanted to laugh.
I guess I did laugh when I went aloft to clean the lamp and
    found everything so free and breezy, gulls flying high and
    little whitecaps making under a westerly. It was like feeling a
    big load dropped off your shoulders. Fedderson came up with his
    dust-rag and cocked his head at me.
"What's the matter, Ray?" said he.
"Nothing," said I. And then I couldn't help it. "Seems kind
    of out of place for society notes," said I, "out here at Seven
    Brothers."
He was the other side of the lens, and when he looked at me
    he had a thousand eyes, all sober. For a minute I thought he
    was going on dusting, but then he came out and sat down on a
    sill.
"Sometimes," said he, "I get to thinking it may be a mite
    dull for her out here. She's pretty young, Ray. Not much more'n
    a girl, hardly."
"Not much more'n a girl!" It gave me a turn, sir,
    as though I'd seen my aunt in short dresses.
"It's a good home for her, though," he went on slow. "I've
    seen a lot worse ashore, Ray. Of course if I could get a shore
    light——"
"Kingdom Come's a shore light."
He looked at me out of his deep-set eyes, and then he turned
    them around the light-room, where he'd been so long.
"No," said he, wagging his head. "It ain't for such as
    me."
I never saw so humble a man.
"But look here," he went on, more cheerful. "As I was
    telling her just now, a month from yesterday's our fourth
    anniversary, and I'm going to take her ashore for the day and
    give her a holiday—new hat and everything. A girl wants a
    mite of excitement now and then, Ray."
There it was again, that "girl." It gave me the fidgets,
    sir. I had to do something about it. It's close quarters for
    last names in a light, and I'd taken to calling him Uncle Matt
    soon after I came. Now, when I was at table that noon I spoke
    over to where she was standing by the stove, getting him
    another help of chowder.
"I guess I'll have some, too, Aunt Anna," said I,
    matter of fact.
She never said a word nor gave a sign—just stood there
    kind of round-shouldered, dipping the chowder. And that night
    at prayers I hitched my chair around the table, with its back
    the other way.
You get awful lazy in a lighthouse, some ways. No matter how
    much tinkering you've got, there's still a lot of time and
    there's such a thing as too much reading. The changes in
    weather get monotonous, too, by and by; the light burns the
    same on a thick night as it does on a fair one. Of course
    there's the ships, north-bound, south-bound—wind-jammers,
    freighters, passenger-boats full of people. In the watches at
    night you can see their lights go by, and wonder what they are,
    how they're laden, where they'll fetch up, and all. I used to
    do that almost every evening when it was my first watch,
    sitting out on the walk-around up there with my legs hanging
    over the edge and my chin propped on the railing—lazy.
    The Boston boat was the prettiest to see, with her three tiers
    of port-holes lit, like a string of pearls wrapped round and
    round a woman's neck—well away, too, for the ledge must
    have made a couple of hundred fathoms off the Light, like a
    white dog-tooth of a breaker, even on the darkest night.
Well, I was lolling there one night, as I say, watching the
    Boston boat go by, not thinking of anything special, when I
    heard the door on the other side of the tower open and
    footsteps coming around to me.
By and by I nodded toward the boat and passed the remark
    that she was fetching in uncommon close to-night. No answer. I
    made nothing of that, for oftentimes Fedderson wouldn't answer,
    and after I'd watched the lights crawling on through the dark a
    spell, just to make conversation I said I guessed there'd be a
    bit of weather before long.
"I've noticed," said I, "when there's weather coming on, and
    the wind in the northeast, you can hear the orchestra playing
    aboard of her just over there. I make it out now. Do you?"
"Yes. Oh—yes—! I hear it all
    right!"
You can imagine I started. It wasn't him, but her.
    And there was something in the way she said that speech,
    sir—something—well—unnatural. Like a hungry
    animal snapping at a person's hand.
I turned and looked at her sidewise. She was standing by the
    railing, leaning a little outward, the top of her from the
    waist picked out bright by the lens behind her. I didn't know
    what in the world to say, and yet I had a feeling I ought not
    to sit there mum.
"I wonder," said I, "what that captain's thinking of,
    fetching in so handy to-night. It's no way. I tell you, if
    'twasn't for this light, she'd go to work and pile up on the
    ledge some thick night——"
She turned at that and stared straight into the lens. I
    didn't like the look of her face. Somehow, with its edges cut
    hard all around and its two eyes closed down to slits, like a
    cat's, it made a kind of mask.
"And then," I went on, uneasy enough—"and then where'd
    all their music be of a sudden, and their goings-on and their
    singing——"
"And dancing!" She clipped me off so quick it took my
    breath.
"D-d-dancing?" said I.
"That's dance-music," said she. She was looking at the boat
    again.
"How do you know?" I felt I had to keep on talking.
Well, sir—she laughed. I looked at her. She had on a
    shawl of some stuff or other that shined in the light; she had
    it pulled tight around her with her two hands in front at her
    breast, and I saw her shoulders swaying in tune.
"How do I know?" she cried. Then she laughed again,
    the same kind of a laugh. It was queer, sir, to see her, and to
    hear her. She turned, as quick as that, and leaned toward me.
    "Don't you know how to dance, Ray?" said she.
"N-no," I managed, and I was going to say "Aunt
    Anna," but the thing choked in my throat.
I tell you she was looking square at me all the time with
    her two eyes and moving with the music as if she didn't know
    it. By heavens, sir, it came over me of a sudden that she
    wasn't so bad-looking, after all. I guess I must have sounded
    like a fool.
"You—you see," said I, "she's cleared the rip there
    now, and the music's gone. You—you hear?"
"Yes," said she, turning back slow. "That's where it stops
    every night—night after night—it stops just
    there—at the rip."
When she spoke again her voice was different. I never heard
    the like of it, thin and taut as a thread. It made me shiver,
    sir.
"I hate 'em!" That's what she said. "I hate 'em all. I'd
    like to see 'em dead. I'd love to see 'em torn apart on the
    rocks, night after night. I could bathe my hands in their
    blood, night after night."
And do you know, sir, I saw it with my own eyes, her hands
    moving in each other above the rail. But it was her voice,
    though. I didn't know what to do, or what to say, so I poked my
    head through the railing and looked down at the water. I don't
    think I'm a coward, sir, but it was like a
    cold—ice-cold—hand, taking hold of my beating
    heart.
When I looked up finally, she was gone. By and by I went in
    and had a look at the lamp, hardly knowing what I was about.
    Then, seeing by my watch it was time for the old man to come on
    duty, I started to go below. In the Seven Brothers, you
    understand, the stair goes down in a spiral through a well
    against the south wall and first there's the door to the
    keeper's room and then you come to another, and that's the
    living-room, and then down to the store-room. And at night, if
    you don't carry a lantern, it's as black as the pit.
Well, down I went, sliding my hand along the rail, and as
    usual I stopped to give a rap on the keeper's door, in case he
    was taking a nap after supper. Sometimes he did.
I stood there, blind as a bat, with my mind still up on the
    walk-around. There was no answer to my knock. I hadn't expected
    any. Just from habit, and with my right foot already hanging
    down for the next step, I reached out to give the door one more
    tap for luck.
Do you know, sir, my hand didn't fetch up on anything. The
    door had been there a second before, and now the door wasn't
    there. My hand just went on going through the dark, on and on,
    and I didn't seem to have sense or power enough to stop it.
    There didn't seem any air in the well to breathe, and my ears
    were drumming to the surf—that's how scared I was. And
    then my hand touched the flesh of a face, and something in the
    dark said, "Oh!" no louder than a sigh.
Next thing I knew, sir, I was down in the living-room, warm
    and yellow-lit, with Fedderson cocking his head at me across
    the table, where he was at that eternal Jacob's-ladder of
    his.
"What's the matter, Ray?" said he. "Lord's sake, Ray!"
"Nothing," said I. Then I think I told him I was sick. That
    night I wrote a letter to A.L. Peters, the grain-dealer in
    Duxbury, asking for a job—even though it wouldn't go
    ashore for a couple of weeks, just the writing of it made me
    feel better.
It's hard to tell you how those two weeks went by. I don't
    know why, but I felt like hiding in a corner all the time. I
    had to come to meals, but I didn't look at her, though, not
    once, unless it was by accident. Fedderson thought I was still
    ailing and nagged me to death with advice and so on. One thing
    I took care not to do, I can tell you, and that was to knock on
    his door till I'd made certain he wasn't below in the
    living-room—though I was tempted to.
Yes, sir; that's a queer thing, and I wouldn't tell you if I
    hadn't set out to give you the truth. Night after night,
    stopping there on the landing in that black pit, the air gone
    out of my lungs and the surf drumming in my ears and sweat
    standing cold on my neck—and one hand lifting up in the
    air—God forgive me, sir! Maybe I did wrong not to look at
    her more, drooping about her work in her gingham apron, with
    her hair stringing.
When the Inspector came off with the tender, that time, I
    told him I was through. That's when he took the dislike to me,
    I guess, for he looked at me kind of sneering and said, soft as
    I was, I'd have to put up with it till next relief. And then,
    said he, there'd be a whole house-cleaning at Seven Brothers,
    because he'd gotten Fedderson the berth at Kingdom Come. And
    with that he slapped the old man on the back.
I wish you could have seen Fedderson, sir. He sat down on my
    cot as if his knees had given 'way. Happy? You'd think he'd be
    happy, with all his dreams come true. Yes, he was happy,
    beaming all over—for a minute. Then, sir, he began to
    shrivel up. It was like seeing a man cut down in his prime
    before your eyes. He began to wag his head.
"No," said he. "No, no; it's not for such as me. I'm good
    enough for Seven Brothers, and that's all, Mr. Bayliss. That's
    all."
And for all the Inspector could say, that's what he stuck
    to. He'd figured himself a martyr so many years, nursed that
    injustice like a mother with her first-born, sir; and now in
    his old age, so to speak, they weren't to rob him of it.
    Fedderson was going to wear out his life in a second-class
    light, and folks would talk—that was his idea. I heard
    him hailing down as the tender was casting off:
"See you to-morrow, Mr. Bayliss. Yep. Coming ashore with the
    wife for a spree. Anniversary. Yep."
But he didn't sound much like a spree. They had,
    robbed him, partly, after all. I wondered what she
    thought about it. I didn't know till night. She didn't show up
    to supper, which Fedderson and I got ourselves—had a
    headache, be said. It was my early watch. I went and lit up and
    came back to read a spell. He was finishing off the
    Jacob's-ladder, and thoughtful, like a man that's lost a
    treasure. Once or twice I caught him looking about the room on
    the sly. It was pathetic, sir.
Going up the second time, I stepped out on the walk-around
    to have a look at things. She was there on the seaward side,
    wrapped in that silky thing. A fair sea was running across the
    ledge and it was coming on a little thick—not too thick.
    Off to the right the Boston boat was blowing,
    whroom-whroom! Creeping up on us, quarter-speed. There
    was another fellow behind her, and a fisherman's conch farther
    offshore.
I don't know why, but I stopped beside her and leaned on the
    rail. She didn't appear to notice me, one way or another. We
    stood and we stood, listening to the whistles, and the longer
    we stood the more it got on my nerves, her not noticing me. I
    suppose she'd been too much on my mind lately. I began to be
    put out. I scraped my feet. I coughed. By and by I said out
    loud:
"Look here, I guess I better get out the fog-horn and give
    those fellows a toot."
"Why?" said she, without moving her head—calm as
    that.
"Why?" It gave me a turn, sir. For a minute I
    stared at her. "Why? Because if she don't pick up this light
    before very many minutes she'll be too close in to
    wear—tide'll have her on the rocks—that's why!"
I couldn't see her face, but I could see one of her silk
    shoulders lift a little, like a shrug. And there I kept on
    staring at her, a dumb one, sure enough. I know what brought me
    to was hearing the Boston boat's three sharp toots as she
    picked up the light—mad as anything—and swung her
    helm a-port. I turned away from her, sweat stringing down my
    face, and walked around to the door. It was just as well, too,
    for the feed-pipe was plugged in the lamp and the wicks were
    popping. She'd have been out in another five minutes, sir.
When I'd finished, I saw that woman standing in the doorway.
    Her eyes were bright. I had a horror of her, sir, a living
    horror.
"If only the light had been out," said she, low and
    sweet.
"God forgive you," said I. "You don't know what you're
    saying."
She went down the stair into the well, winding out of sight,
    and as long as I could see her, her eyes were watching mine.
    When I went, myself, after a few minutes, she was waiting for
    me on that first landing, standing still in the dark. She took
    hold of my hand, though I tried to get it away.
"Good-by," said she in my ear.
"Good-by?" said I. I didn't understand.
"You heard what he said to-day—about Kingdom Come? Be
    it so—on his own head. I'll never come back here. Once I
    set foot ashore—I've got friends in Brightonboro,
    Ray."
I got away from her and started on down. But I stopped.
    "Brightonboro?" I whispered back. "Why do you tell
    me?" My throat was raw to the words, like a sore.
"So you'd know," said she.
Well, sir, I saw them off next morning, down that new
    Jacob's-ladder into the dinghy-boat, her in a dress of blue
    velvet and him in his best cutaway and derby—rowing away,
    smaller and smaller, the two of them. And then I went back and
    sat on my cot, leaving the door open and the ladder still
    hanging down the wall, along with the boat-falls.
I don't know whether it was relief, or what. I suppose I
    must have been worked up even more than I'd thought those past
    weeks, for now it was all over I was like a rag. I got down on
    my knees, sir, and prayed to God for the salvation of my soul,
    and when I got up and climbed to the living-room it was half
    past twelve by the clock. There was rain on the windows and the
    sea was running blue-black under the sun. I'd sat there all
    that time not knowing there was a squall.
It was funny; the glass stood high, but those black squalls
    kept coming and going all afternoon, while I was at work up in
    the light-room. And I worked hard, to keep myself busy. First
    thing I knew it was five, and no sign of the boat yet. It began
    to get dim and kind of purplish-gray over the land. The sun was
    down. I lit up, made everything snug, and got out the
    night-glasses to have another look for that boat. He'd said he
    intended to get back before five. No sign. And then, standing
    there, it came over me that of course he wouldn't be coming
    off—he'd be hunting her, poor old fool. It
    looked like I had to stand two men's watches that night.
Never mind. I felt like myself again, even if I hadn't had
    any dinner or supper. Pride came to me that night on the
    walk-around, watching the boats go by—little boats, big
    boats, the Boston boat with all her pearls and her dance-music.
    They couldn't see me; they didn't know who I was; but to the
    last of them, they depended on me. They say a man must
    be born again. Well, I was born again. I breathed deep in the
    wind.
Dawn broke hard and red as a dying coal. I put out the light
    and started to go below. Born again; yes, sir. I felt so good I
    whistled in the well, and when I came to the first door on the
    stair I reached out in the dark to give it a rap for luck. And
    then, sir, the hair prickled all over my scalp, when I found my
    hand just going on and on through the air, the same as it had
    gone once before, and all of a sudden I wanted to yell, because
    I thought I was going to touch flesh. It's funny what their
    just forgetting to close their door did to me, isn't it?
Well, I reached for the latch and pulled it to with a bang
    and ran down as if a ghost was after me. I got up some coffee
    and bread and bacon for breakfast. I drank the coffee. But
    somehow I couldn't eat, all along of that open door. The light
    in the room was blood. I got to thinking. I thought how she'd
    talked about those men, women, and children on the rocks, and
    how she'd made to bathe her hands over the rail. I almost
    jumped out of my chair then; it seemed for a wink she was there
    beside the stove watching me with that queer
    half-smile—really, I seemed to see her for a flash across
    the red table-cloth in the red light of dawn.
"Look here!" said I to myself, sharp enough; and then I gave
    myself a good laugh and went below. There I took a look out of
    the door, which was still open, with the ladder hanging down. I
    made sure to see the poor old fool come pulling around the
    point before very long now.
My boots were hurting a little, and, taking them off, I lay
    down on the cot to rest, and somehow I went to sleep. I had
    horrible dreams. I saw her again standing in that blood-red
    kitchen, and she seemed to be washing her hands, and the surf
    on the ledge was whining up the tower, louder and louder all
    the time, and what it whined was, "Night after
    night—night after night." What woke me was cold water in
    my face.
The store-room was in gloom. That scared me at first; I
    thought night had come, and remembered the light. But then I
    saw the gloom was of a storm. The floor was shining wet, and
    the water in my face was spray, flung up through the open door.
    When I ran to close it, it almost made me dizzy to see the
    gray-and-white breakers marching past. The land was gone; the
    sky shut down heavy overhead; there was a piece of wreckage on
    the back of a swell, and the Jacob's-ladder was carried clean
    away. How that sea had picked up so quick I can't think. I
    looked at my watch and it wasn't four in the afternoon yet.
When I closed the door, sir, it was almost dark in the
    store-room. I'd never been in the Light before in a gale of
    wind. I wondered why I was shivering so, till I found it was
    the floor below me shivering, and the walls and stair. Horrible
    crunchings and grindings ran away up the tower, and now and
    then there was a great thud somewhere, like a cannon-shot in a
    cave. I tell you, sir, I was alone, and I was in a mortal
    fright for a minute or so. And yet I had to get myself
    together. There was the light up there not tended to, and an
    early dark coming on and a heavy night and all, and I had to
    go. And I had to pass that door.
You'll say it's foolish, sir, and maybe it was
    foolish. Maybe it was because I hadn't eaten. But I began
    thinking of that door up there the minute I set foot on the
    stair, and all the way up through that howling dark well I
    dreaded to pass it. I told myself I wouldn't stop. I didn't
    stop. I felt the landing underfoot and I went on, four steps,
    five—and then I couldn't. I turned and went back. I put
    out my hand and it went on into nothing. That door, sir, was
    open again.
I left it be; I went on up to the light-room and set to
    work. It was Bedlam there, sir, screeching Bedlam, but I took
    no notice. I kept my eyes down. I trimmed those seven wicks,
    sir, as neat as ever they were trimmed; I polished the brass
    till it shone, and I dusted the lens. It wasn't till that was
    done that I let myself look back to see who it was standing
    there, half out of sight in the well. It was her, sir.
"Where'd you come from?" I asked. I remember my voice was
    sharp.
"Up Jacob's-ladder," said she, and hers was like the syrup
    of flowers.
I shook my head. I was savage, sir. "The ladder's carried
    away."
"I cast it off," said she, with a smile.
"Then," said I, "you must have come while I was asleep."
    Another thought came on me heavy as a ton of lead. "And where's
    he?" said I. "Where's the boat?"
"He's drowned," said she, as easy as that. "And I let the
    boat go adrift. You wouldn't hear me when I called."
"But look here," said I. "If you came through the
    store-room, why didn't you wake me up? Tell me that!" It sounds
    foolish enough, me standing like a lawyer in court, trying to
    prove she couldn't be there.
She didn't answer for a moment. I guess she sighed, though I
    couldn't hear for the gale, and her eyes grew soft, sir, so
    soft.
"I couldn't," said she. "You looked so peaceful—dear
    one."
My cheeks and neck went hot, sir, as if a warm iron was laid
    on them. I didn't know what to say. I began to stammer, "What
    do you mean—" but she was going back down the stair, out
    of sight. My God sir, and I used not to think she was
    good-looking!
I started to follow her. I wanted to know what she meant.
    Then I said to myself, "If I don't go—if I wait
    here—she'll come back." And I went to the weather side
    and stood looking out of the window. Not that there was much to
    see. It was growing dark, and the Seven Brothers looked like
    the mane of a running horse, a great, vast, white horse running
    into the wind. The air was a-welter with it. I caught one peep
    of a fisherman, lying down flat trying to weather the ledge,
    and I said, "God help them all to-night," and then I went hot
    at sound of that "God."
I was right about her, though. She was back again. I wanted
    her to speak first, before I turned, but she wouldn't. I didn't
    hear her go out; I didn't know what she was up to till I saw
    her coming outside on the walk-around, drenched wet already. I
    pounded on the glass for her to come in and not be a fool; if
    she heard she gave no sign of it.
There she stood, and there I stood watching her. Lord,
    sir—was it just that I'd never had eyes to see? Or are
    there women who bloom? Her clothes were shining on her, like a
    carving, and her hair was let down like a golden curtain
    tossing and streaming in the gale, and there she stood with her
    lips half open, drinking, and her eyes half closed, gazing
    straight away over the Seven Brothers, and her shoulders
    swaying, as if in tune with the wind and water and all the
    ruin. And when I looked at her hands over the rail, sir, they
    were moving in each other as if they bathed, and then I
    remembered, sir.
A cold horror took me. I knew now why she had come back
    again. She wasn't a woman—she was a devil. I turned my
    back on her. I said to myself: "It's time to light up. You've
    got to light up"—like that, over and over, out loud. My
    hand was shivering so I could hardly find a match; and when I
    scratched it, it only flared a second and then went out in the
    back draught from the open door. She was standing in the
    doorway, looking at me. It's queer, sir, but I felt like a
    child caught in mischief.
"I—I—was going to light up," I managed to say,
    finally.
"Why?" said she. No, I can't say it as she did.
"Why?" said I. "My God!"
She came nearer, laughing, as if with pity, low, you know.
    "Your God? And who is your God? What is God? What is anything
    on a night like this?"
I drew back from her. All I could say anything about was the
    light.
"Why not the dark?" said she. "Dark is softer than
    light—tenderer—dearer than light. From the dark up
    here, away up here in the wind and storm, we can watch the
    ships go by, you and I. And you love me so. You've loved me so
    long, Ray."
"I never have!" I struck out at her. "I don't! I don't!"
Her voice was lower than ever, but there was the same
    laughing pity in it. "Oh yes, you have." And she was near me
    again.
"I have?" I yelled. "I'll show you! I'll show you if I
    have!"
I got another match, sir, and scratched it on the brass. I
    gave it to the first wick, the little wick that's inside all
    the others. It bloomed like a yellow flower. "I have?"
    I yelled, and gave it to the next.
Then there was a shadow, and I saw she was leaning beside
    me, her two elbows on the brass, her two arms stretched out
    above the wicks, her bare forearms and wrists and hands. I gave
    a gasp:
"Take care! You'll burn them! For God's
    sake——"
She didn't move or speak. The match burned my fingers and
    went out, and all I could do was stare at those arms of hers,
    helpless. I'd never noticed her arms before. They were rounded
    and graceful and covered with a soft down, like a breath of
    gold. Then I heard her speaking close to my ear.
"Pretty arms," she said. "Pretty arms!"
I turned. Her eyes were fixed on mine. They seemed heavy, as
    if with sleep, and yet between their lids they were two wells,
    deep and deep, and as if they held all the things I'd ever
    thought or dreamed in them. I looked away from them, at her
    lips. Her lips were red as poppies, heavy with redness. They
    moved, and I heard them speaking:
"Poor boy, you love me so, and you want to kiss
    me—don't you?"
"No," said I. But I couldn't turn around. I looked at her
    hair. I'd always thought it was stringy hair. Some hair curls
    naturally with damp, they say, and perhaps that was it, for
    there were pearls of wet on it, and it was thick and shimmering
    around her face, making soft shadows by the temples. There was
    green in it, queer strands of green like braids.
"What is it?" said I.
"Nothing but weed," said she, with that slow, sleepy
    smile.
Somehow or other I felt calmer than I had any time. "Look
    here," said I. "I'm going to light this lamp." I took out a
    match, scratched it, and touched the third wick. The flame ran
    around, bigger than the other two together. But still her arms
    hung there. I bit my lip. "By God, I will!" said I to myself,
    and I lit the fourth.
It was fierce, sir, fierce! And yet those arms never
    trembled. I had to look around at her. Her eyes were still
    looking into mine, so deep and deep, and her red lips were
    still smiling with that queer, sleepy droop; the only thing was
    that tears were raining down her cheeks—big, glowing
    round, jewel tears. It wasn't human, sir. It was like a
    dream.
"Pretty arms," she sighed, and then, as if those words had
    broken something in her heart, there came a great sob bursting
    from her lips. To hear it drove me mad. I reached to drag her
    away, but she was too quick, sir; she cringed from me and
    slipped out from between my hands. It was like she faded away,
    sir, and went down in a bundle, nursing her poor arms and
    mourning over them with those terrible, broken sobs.
The sound of them took the manhood out of me—you'd
    have been the same, sir. I knelt down beside her on the floor
    and covered my face.
"Please!" I moaned. "Please! Please!" That's all I could
    say. I wanted her to forgive me. I reached out a hand, blind,
    for forgiveness, and I couldn't find her anywhere. I had hurt
    her so, and she was afraid of me, of me, sir, who
    loved her so deep it drove me crazy.
I could see her down the stair, though it was dim and my
    eyes were filled with tears. I stumbled after her, crying,
    "Please! Please!" The little wicks I'd lit were blowing in the
    wind from the door and smoking the glass beside them black. One
    went out. I pleaded with them, the same as I would plead with a
    human being. I said I'd be back in a second. I promised. And I
    went on down the stair, crying like a baby because I'd hurt
    her, and she was afraid of me—of me, sir.
She had gone into her room. The door was closed against me
    and I could hear her sobbing beyond it, broken-hearted. My
    heart was broken too. I beat on the door with my palms. I
    begged her to forgive me. I told her I loved her. And all the
    answer was that sobbing in the dark.
And then I lifted the latch and went in, groping, pleading.
    "Dearest—please! Because I love you!"
I heard her speak down near the floor. There wasn't any
    anger in her voice; nothing but sadness and despair.
"No," said she. "You don't love me, Ray. You never
    have."
"I do! I have!"
"No, no," said she, as if she was tired out.
"Where are you?" I was groping for her. I thought, and lit a
    match. She had got to the door and was standing there as if
    ready to fly. I went toward her, and she made me stop. She took
    my breath away. "I hurt your arms," said I, in a dream.
"No," said she, hardly moving her lips. She held them out to
    the match's light for me to look and there was never a scar on
    them—not even that soft, golden down was singed, sir.
    "You can't hurt my body," said she, sad as anything. "Only my
    heart, Ray; my poor heart."
I tell you again, she took my breath away. I lit another
    match. "How can you be so beautiful?" I wondered.
She answered in riddles—but oh, the sadness of her,
    sir.
"Because," said she, "I've always so wanted to be."
"How come your eyes so heavy?" said I.
"Because I've seen so many things I never dreamed of," said
    she.
"How come your hair so thick?"
"It's the seaweed makes it thick," said she smiling queer,
    queer.
"How come seaweed there?"
"Out of the bottom of the sea."
She talked in riddles, but it was like poetry to hear her,
    or a song.
"How come your lips so red?" said I.
"Because they've wanted so long to be kissed."
Fire was on me, sir. I reached out to catch her, but she was
    gone, out of the door and down the stair. I followed,
    stumbling. I must have tripped on the turn, for I remember
    going through the air and fetching up with a crash, and I
    didn't know anything for a spell—how long I can't say.
    When I came to, she was there, somewhere, bending over me,
    crooning, "My love—my love—" under her breath like,
    a song.
But then when I got up, she was not where my arms went; she
    was down the stair again, just ahead of me. I followed her. I
    was tottering and dizzy and full of pain. I tried to catch up
    with her in the dark of the store-room, but she was too quick
    for me, sir, always a little too quick for me. Oh, she was
    cruel to me, sir. I kept bumping against things, hurting myself
    still worse, and it was cold and wet and a horrible noise all
    the while, sir; and then, sir, I found the door was open, and a
    sea had parted the hinges.
I don't know how it all went, sir. I'd tell you if I could,
    but it's all so blurred—sometimes it seems more like a
    dream. I couldn't find her any more; I couldn't hear her; I
    went all over, everywhere. Once, I remember, I found myself
    hanging out of that door between the davits, looking down into
    those big black seas and crying like a baby. It's all riddles
    and blur. I can't seem to tell you much, sir. It was
    all—all—I don't know.
I was talking to somebody else—not her. It was the
    Inspector. I hardly knew it was the Inspector. His face was as
    gray as a blanket, and his eyes were bloodshot, and his lips
    were twisted. His left wrist hung down, awkward. It was broken
    coming aboard the Light in that sea. Yes, we were in the
    living-room. Yes, sir, it was daylight—gray daylight. I
    tell you, sir, the man looked crazy to me. He was waving his
    good arm toward the weather windows, and what he was saying,
    over and over, was this:
"Look what you done, damn you! Look what you
    done!"
And what I was saying was this:
"I've lost her!"
I didn't pay any attention to him, nor him to me. By and by
    he did, though. He stopped his talking all of a sudden, and his
    eyes looked like the devil's eyes. He put them up close to
    mine. He grabbed my arm with his good hand, and I cried, I was
    so weak.
"Johnson," said he, "is that it? By the living God—if
    you got a woman out here, Johnson!"
"No," said I. "I've lost her."
"What do you mean—lost her?"
"It was dark," said I—and it's funny how my head was
    clearing up—"and the door was open—the store-room
    door—and I was after her—and I guess she stumbled,
    maybe—and I lost her."
"Johnson," said he, "what do you mean? You sound
    crazy—downright crazy. Who?"
"Her," said I. "Fedderson's wife."
"Who?"
"Her," said I. And with that he gave my arm another
    jerk.
"Listen," said he, like a tiger. "Don't try that on me. It
    won't do any good—that kind of lies—not where
    you're going to. Fedderson and his wife, too—the
    both of 'em's drowned deader 'n a door-nail."
"I know," said I, nodding my head. I was so calm it made him
    wild.
"You're crazy! Crazy as a loon, Johnson!" And he was chewing
    his lip red. "I know, because it was me that found the old man
    laying on Back Water Flats yesterday morning—me!
    And she'd been with him in the boat, too, because he had a
    piece of her jacket tore off, tangled in his arm."
"I know," said I, nodding again, like that.
"You know what, you crazy, murdering
    fool?" Those were his words to me, sir.
"I know," said I, "what I know."
"And I know," said he, "what I know."
And there you are, sir. He's Inspector.
    I'm—nobody.
