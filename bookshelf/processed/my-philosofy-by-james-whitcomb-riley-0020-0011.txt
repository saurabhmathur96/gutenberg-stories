MY PHILOSOFY

 BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY

  I ain't, ner don't p'tend to be, 

 Much posted on philosofy; 

 But thare is times, when all alone, 

 I work out idees of my own. 

 And of these same thare is a few 

 I'd like to jest refer to you— 

 Pervidin' that you don't object 

 To listen clos't and rickollect. 



 I allus argy that a man 

 Who does about the best he can 

 Is plenty good enugh to suit 

 This lower mundane institute— 

 No matter ef his daily walk 

 Is subject fer his neghbor's talk, 

 And critic-minds of ev'ry whim 

 Jest all git up and go fer him! 



 I knowed a feller onc't that had 

 The yeller-janders mighty bad,— 

 And each and ev'ry friend he'd meet 

 Would stop and give him some receet 

 Fer cuorin' of 'em. But he'd say 

 He kindo' thought they'd go away 

 Without no medicin', and boast 

 That he'd git well without one doste.





 He kep' a-yellerin' on—and they 

 Perdictin' that he'd die some day 

 Before he knowed it! Tuck his bed, 

 The feller did, and lost his head, 

 And wundered in his mind a spell— 

 Then rallied, and, at last, got well; 

 But ev'ry friend that said he'd die 

 Went back on him eternally! 



 Its natchurl enugh, I guess, 

 When some gits more and some gits less, 

 Fer them-uns on the slimmest side 

 To claim it ain't a fare divide; 

 And I've knowed some to lay and wait, 

 And git up soon, and set up late, 

 To ketch some feller they could hate 

 Fer goin' at a faster gait. 



 The signs is bad when folks commence 

 A-findin' fault with Providence, 

 And balkin' 'cause the earth don't shake 

 At ev'ry prancin' step they take. 

 No man is grate tel he can see 

 How less than little he would be 

 Ef stripped to self, and stark and bare 

 He hung his sign out anywhare. 



 My doctern is to lay aside 

 Contensions, and be satisfied: 

 Jest do your best, and praise er blame 

 That follers that, counts jest the same. 

 I've allus noticed grate success 

 Is mixed with troubles, more or less, 

 And it's the man who does the best 

 That gits more kicks than all the rest.
