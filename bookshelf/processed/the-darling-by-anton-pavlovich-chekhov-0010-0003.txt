THE DARLING

 BY ANTON P. CHEKOV

 O

lenka, the daughter of the retired collegiate assessor Plemyanikov, was
sitting on the back-door steps of her house doing nothing. It was hot, the
flies were nagging and teasing, and it was pleasant to think that it would
soon be evening. Dark rain clouds were gathering from the east, wafting a
breath of moisture every now and then.

 Kukin, who roomed in the wing of the same house, was standing in the yard
looking up at the sky. He was the manager of the Tivoli, an open-air
theatre.

 “Again,” he said despairingly. “Rain again. Rain, rain,
rain! Every day rain! As though to spite me. I might as well stick my head
into a noose and be done with it. It’s ruining me. Heavy losses
every day!” He wrung his hands, and continued, addressing Olenka:
“What a life, Olga Semyonovna! It’s enough to make a man weep.
He works, he does his best, his very best, he tortures himself, he passes
sleepless nights, he thinks and thinks and thinks how to do everything
just right. And what’s the result? He gives the public the best
operetta, the very best pantomime, excellent artists. But do they want it?
Have they the least appreciation of it? The public is rude. The public is
a great boor. The public wants a circus, a lot of nonsense, a lot of
stuff. And there’s the weather. Look! Rain almost every evening. It
began to rain on the tenth of May, and it’s kept it up through the
whole of June. It’s simply awful. I can’t get any audiences,
and don’t I have to pay rent? Don’t I have to pay the actors?”

 The next day towards evening the clouds gathered again, and Kukin said
with an hysterical laugh:

 “Oh, I don’t care. Let it do its worst. Let it drown the whole
theatre, and me, too. All right, no luck for me in this world or the next.
Let the actors bring suit against me and drag me to court. What’s
the court? Why not Siberia at hard labour, or even the scaffold? Ha, ha,
ha!”

 It was the same on the third day.

 Olenka listened to Kukin seriously, in silence. Sometimes tears would rise
to her eyes. At last Kukin’s misfortune touched her. She fell in
love with him. He was short, gaunt, with a yellow face, and curly hair
combed back from his forehead, and a thin tenor voice. His features
puckered all up when he spoke. Despair was ever inscribed on his face. And
yet he awakened in Olenka a sincere, deep feeling.

 She was always loving somebody. She couldn’t get on without loving
somebody. She had loved her sick father, who sat the whole time in his
armchair in a darkened room, breathing heavily. She had loved her aunt,
who came from Brianska once or twice a year to visit them. And before
that, when a pupil at the progymnasium, she had loved her French teacher.
She was a quiet, kind-hearted, compassionate girl, with a soft gentle way
about her. And she made a very healthy, wholesome impression. Looking at
her full, rosy cheeks, at her soft white neck with the black mole, and at
the good naïve smile that always played on her face when something
pleasant was said, the men would think, “Not so bad,” and
would smile too; and the lady visitors, in the middle of the conversation,
would suddenly grasp her hand and exclaim, “You darling!” in a
burst of delight.

 The house, hers by inheritance, in which she had lived from birth, was
located at the outskirts of the city on the Gypsy Road, not far from the
Tivoli. From early evening till late at night she could hear the music in
the theatre and the bursting of the rockets; and it seemed to her that
Kukin was roaring and battling with his fate and taking his chief enemy,
the indifferent public, by assault. Her heart melted softly, she felt no
desire to sleep, and when Kukin returned home towards morning, she tapped
on her window-pane, and through the curtains he saw her face and one
shoulder and the kind smile she gave him.

 He proposed to her, and they were married. And when he had a good look of
her neck and her full vigorous shoulders, he clapped his hands and said:

 “You darling!”

 He was happy. But it rained on their wedding-day, and the expression of
despair never left his face.

 They got along well together. She sat in the cashier’s box, kept the
theatre in order, wrote down the expenses, and paid out the salaries. Her
rosy cheeks, her kind naïve smile, like a halo around her face, could be
seen at the cashier’s window, behind the scenes, and in the café.
She began to tell her friends that the theatre was the greatest, the most
important, the most essential thing in the world, that it was the only
place to obtain true enjoyment in and become humanised and educated.

 “But do you suppose the public appreciates it?” she asked.
“What the public wants is the circus. Yesterday Vanichka and I gave Faust Burlesqued , and almost all the boxes were empty. If we had
given some silly nonsense, I assure you, the theatre would have been
overcrowded. To-morrow we’ll put Orpheus in Hades on. Do
come.”

 Whatever Kukin said about the theatre and the actors, she repeated. She
spoke, as he did, with contempt of the public, of its indifference to art,
of its boorishness. She meddled in the rehearsals, corrected the actors,
watched the conduct of the musicians; and when an unfavourable criticism
appeared in the local paper, she wept and went to the editor to argue with
him.

 The actors were fond of her and called her “Vanichka and I”
and “the darling.” She was sorry for them and lent them small
sums. When they bilked her, she never complained to her husband; at the
utmost she shed a few tears.

 In winter, too, they got along nicely together. They leased a theatre in
the town for the whole winter and sublet it for short periods to a Little
Russian theatrical company, to a conjuror and to the local amateur
players.

 Olenka grew fuller and was always beaming with contentment; while Kukin
grew thinner and yellower and complained of his terrible losses, though he
did fairly well the whole winter. At night he coughed, and she gave him
raspberry syrup and lime water, rubbed him with eau de Cologne, and
wrapped him up in soft coverings.

 “You are my precious sweet,” she said with perfect sincerity,
stroking his hair. “You are such a dear.”

 At Lent he went to Moscow to get his company together, and, while without
him, Olenka was unable to sleep. She sat at the window the whole time,
gazing at the stars. She likened herself to the hens that are also uneasy
and unable to sleep when their rooster is out of the coop. Kukin was
detained in Moscow. He wrote he would be back during Easter Week, and in
his letters discussed arrangements already for the Tivoli. But late one
night, before Easter Monday, there was an ill-omened knocking at the
wicket-gate. It was like a knocking on a barrel—boom, boom, boom!
The sleepy cook ran barefooted, plashing through the puddles, to open the
gate.

 “Open the gate, please,” said some one in a hollow bass voice.
“I have a telegram for you.”

 Olenka had received telegrams from her husband before; but this time,
somehow, she was numbed with terror. She opened the telegram with
trembling hands and read:

 “Ivan Petrovich died suddenly to-day. Awaiting propt orders for
wuneral Tuesday.”

 That was the way the telegram was written—“wuneral”—and
another unintelligible word—“propt.” The telegram was
signed by the manager of the opera company.

 “My dearest!” Olenka burst out sobbing. “Vanichka, my
dearest, my sweetheart. Why did I ever meet you? Why did I ever get to
know you and love you? To whom have you abandoned your poor Olenka, your
poor, unhappy Olenka?”

 Kukin was buried on Tuesday in the Vagankov Cemetery in Moscow. Olenka
returned home on Wednesday; and as soon as she entered her house she threw
herself on her bed and broke into such loud sobbing that she could be
heard in the street and in the neighbouring yards.

 “The darling!” said the neighbours, crossing themselves.
“How Olga Semyonovna, the poor darling, is grieving!”

 Three months afterwards Olenka was returning home from mass, downhearted
and in deep mourning. Beside her walked a man also returning from church,
Vasily Pustovalov, the manager of the merchant Babakayev’s
lumber-yard. He was wearing a straw hat, a white vest with a gold chain,
and looked more like a landowner than a business man.

 “Everything has its ordained course, Olga Semyonovna,” he said
sedately, with sympathy in his voice. “And if any one near and dear
to us dies, then it means it was God’s will and we should remember
that and bear it with submission.”

 He took her to the wicket-gate, said good-bye and went away. After that
she heard his sedate voice the whole day; and on closing her eyes she
instantly had a vision of his dark beard. She took a great liking to him.
And evidently he had been impressed by her, too; for, not long after, an
elderly woman, a distant acquaintance, came in to have a cup of coffee
with her. As soon as the woman was seated at table she began to speak
about Pustovalov—how good he was, what a steady man, and any woman
could be glad to get him as a husband. Three days later Pustovalov himself
paid Olenka a visit. He stayed only about ten minutes, and spoke little,
but Olenka fell in love with him, fell in love so desperately that she did
not sleep the whole night and burned as with fever. In the morning she
sent for the elderly woman. Soon after, Olenka and Pustovalov were
engaged, and the wedding followed.

 Pustovalov and Olenka lived happily together. He usually stayed in the
lumber-yard until dinner, then went out on business. In his absence Olenka
took his place in the office until evening, attending to the book-keeping
and despatching the orders.

 “Lumber rises twenty per cent every year nowadays,” she told
her customers and acquaintances. “Imagine, we used to buy wood from
our forests here. Now Vasichka has to go every year to the government of
Mogilev to get wood. And what a tax!” she exclaimed, covering her
cheeks with her hands in terror. “What a tax!”

 She felt as if she had been dealing in lumber for ever so long, that the
most important and essential thing in life was lumber. There was something
touching and endearing in the way she pronounced the words, “beam,”
“joist,” “plank,” “stave,” “lath,”
“gun-carriage,” “clamp.” At night she dreamed of
whole mountains of boards and planks, long, endless rows of wagons
conveying the wood somewhere, far, far from the city. She dreamed that a
whole regiment of beams, 36 ft. x 5 in., were advancing in an upright
position to do battle against the lumber-yard; that the beams and joists
and clamps were knocking against each other, emitting the sharp crackling
reports of dry wood, that they were all falling and then rising again,
piling on top of each other. Olenka cried out in her sleep, and Pustovalov
said to her gently:

 “Olenka my dear, what is the matter? Cross yourself.”

 Her husband’s opinions were all hers. If he thought the room was too
hot, she thought so too. If he thought business was dull, she thought
business was dull. Pustovalov was not fond of amusements and stayed home
on holidays; she did the same.

 “You are always either at home or in the office,” said her
friends. “Why don’t you go to the theatre or to the circus,
darling?”

 “Vasichka and I never go to the theatre,” she answered
sedately. “We have work to do, we have no time for nonsense. What
does one get out of going to theatre?”

 On Saturdays she and Pustovalov went to vespers, and on holidays to early
mass. On returning home they walked side by side with rapt faces, an
agreeable smell emanating from both of them and her silk dress rustling
pleasantly. At home they drank tea with milk-bread and various jams, and
then ate pie. Every day at noontime there was an appetising odour in the
yard and outside the gate of cabbage soup, roast mutton, or duck; and, on
fast days, of fish. You couldn’t pass the gate without being seized
by an acute desire to eat. The samovar was always boiling on the office
table, and customers were treated to tea and biscuits. Once a week the
married couple went to the baths and returned with red faces, walking side
by side.

 “We are getting along very well, thank God,” said Olenka to
her friends. “God grant that all should live as well as Vasichka and
I.”

 When Pustovalov went to the government of Mogilev to buy wood, she was
dreadfully homesick for him, did not sleep nights, and cried. Sometimes
the veterinary surgeon of the regiment, Smirnov, a young man who lodged in
the wing of her house, came to see her evenings. He related incidents, or
they played cards together. This distracted her. The most interesting of
his stories were those of his own life. He was married and had a son; but
he had separated from his wife because she had deceived him, and now he
hated her and sent her forty rubles a month for his son’s support.
Olenka sighed, shook her head, and was sorry for him.

 “Well, the Lord keep you,” she said, as she saw him off to the
door by candlelight. “Thank you for coming to kill time with me. May
God give you health. Mother in Heaven!” She spoke very sedately,
very judiciously, imitating her husband. The veterinary surgeon had
disappeared behind the door when she called out after him: “Do you
know, Vladimir Platonych, you ought to make up with your wife. Forgive
her, if only for the sake of your son. The child understands everything,
you may be sure.”

 When Pustovalov returned, she told him in a low voice about the veterinary
surgeon and his unhappy family life; and they sighed and shook their
heads, and talked about the boy who must be homesick for his father. Then,
by a strange association of ideas, they both stopped before the sacred
images, made genuflections, and prayed to God to send them children.

 And so the Pustovalovs lived for full six years, quietly and peaceably, in
perfect love and harmony. But once in the winter Vasily Andreyich, after
drinking some hot tea, went out into the lumber-yard without a hat on his
head, caught a cold and took sick. He was treated by the best physicians,
but the malady progressed, and he died after an illness of four months.
Olenka was again left a widow.

 “To whom have you left me, my darling?” she wailed after the
funeral. “How shall I live now without you, wretched creature that I
am. Pity me, good people, pity me, fatherless and motherless, all alone in
the world!”

 She went about dressed in black and weepers, and she gave up wearing hats
and gloves for good. She hardly left the house except to go to church and
to visit her husband’s grave. She almost led the life of a nun.

 It was not until six months had passed that she took off the weepers and
opened her shutters. She began to go out occasionally in the morning to
market with her cook. But how she lived at home and what went on there,
could only be surmised. It could be surmised from the fact that she was
seen in her little garden drinking tea with the veterinarian while he read
the paper out loud to her, and also from the fact that once on meeting an
acquaintance at the post-office, she said to her:

 “There is no proper veterinary inspection in our town. That is why
there is so much disease. You constantly hear of people getting sick from
the milk and becoming infected by the horses and cows. The health of
domestic animals ought really to be looked after as much as that of human
beings.”

 She repeated the veterinarian’s words and held the same opinions as
he about everything. It was plain that she could not exist a single year
without an attachment, and she found her new happiness in the wing of her
house. In any one else this would have been condemned; but no one could
think ill of Olenka. Everything in her life was so transparent. She and
the veterinary surgeon never spoke about the change in their relations.
They tried, in fact, to conceal it, but unsuccessfully; for Olenka could
have no secrets. When the surgeon’s colleagues from the regiment
came to see him, she poured tea, and served the supper, and talked to them
about the cattle plague, the foot and mouth disease, and the municipal
slaughter houses. The surgeon was dreadfully embarrassed, and after the
visitors had left, he caught her hand and hissed angrily:

 “Didn’t I ask you not to talk about what you don’t
understand? When we doctors discuss things, please don’t mix in. It’s
getting to be a nuisance.”

 She looked at him in astonishment and alarm, and asked:

 “But, Volodichka, what am I to talk about?”

 And she threw her arms round his neck, with tears in her eyes, and begged
him not to be angry. And they were both happy.

 But their happiness was of short duration. The veterinary surgeon went
away with his regiment to be gone for good, when it was transferred to
some distant place almost as far as Siberia, and Olenka was left alone.

 Now she was completely alone. Her father had long been dead, and his
armchair lay in the attic covered with dust and minus one leg. She got
thin and homely, and the people who met her on the street no longer looked
at her as they had used to, nor smiled at her. Evidently her best years
were over, past and gone, and a new, dubious life was to begin which it
were better not to think about.

 In the evening Olenka sat on the steps and heard the music playing and the
rockets bursting in the Tivoli; but it no longer aroused any response in
her. She looked listlessly into the yard, thought of nothing, wanted
nothing, and when night came on, she went to bed and dreamed of nothing
but the empty yard. She ate and drank as though by compulsion.

 And what was worst of all, she no longer held any opinions. She saw and
understood everything that went on around her, but she could not form an
opinion about it. She knew of nothing to talk about. And how dreadful not
to have opinions! For instance, you see a bottle, or you see that it is
raining, or you see a muzhik riding by in a wagon. But what the bottle or
the rain or the muzhik are for, or what the sense of them all is, you
cannot tell—you cannot tell, not for a thousand rubles. In the days
of Kukin and Pustovalov and then of the veterinary surgeon, Olenka had had
an explanation for everything, and would have given her opinion freely no
matter about what. But now there was the same emptiness in her heart and
brain as in her yard. It was as galling and bitter as a taste of wormwood.

 Gradually the town grew up all around. The Gypsy Road had become a street,
and where the Tivoli and the lumber-yard had been, there were now houses
and a row of side streets. How quickly time flies! Olenka’s house
turned gloomy, the roof rusty, the shed slanting. Dock and thistles
overgrew the yard. Olenka herself had aged and grown homely. In the summer
she sat on the steps, and her soul was empty and dreary and bitter. When
she caught the breath of spring, or when the wind wafted the chime of the
cathedral bells, a sudden flood of memories would pour over her, her heart
would expand with a tender warmth, and the tears would stream down her
cheeks. But that lasted only a moment. Then would come emptiness again,
and the feeling, What is the use of living? The black kitten Bryska rubbed
up against her and purred softly, but the little creature’s caresses
left Olenka untouched. That was not what she needed. What she needed was a
love that would absorb her whole being, her reason, her whole soul, that
would give her ideas, an object in life, that would warm her aging blood.
And she shook the black kitten off her skirt angrily, saying:

 “Go away! What are you doing here?”

 And so day after day, year after year not a single joy, not a single
opinion. Whatever Marva, the cook, said was all right.

 One hot day in July, towards evening, as the town cattle were being driven
by, and the whole yard was filled with clouds of dust, there was suddenly
a knocking at the gate. Olenka herself went to open it, and was
dumbfounded to behold the veterinarian Smirnov. He had turned grey and was
dressed as a civilian. All the old memories flooded into her soul, she
could not restrain herself, she burst out crying, and laid her head on
Smirnov’s breast without saying a word. So overcome was she that she
was totally unconscious of how they walked into the house and seated
themselves to drink tea.

 “My darling!” she murmured, trembling with joy. “Vladimir
Platonych, from where has God sent you?”

 “I want to settle here for good,” he told her. “I have
resigned my position and have come here to try my fortune as a free man
and lead a settled life. Besides, it’s time to send my boy to the
gymnasium. He is grown up now. You know, my wife and I have become
reconciled.”

 “Where is she?” asked Olenka.

 “At the hotel with the boy. I am looking for lodgings.”

 “Good gracious, bless you, take my house. Why won’t my house
do? Oh, dear! Why, I won’t ask any rent of you,” Olenka burst
out in the greatest excitement, and began to cry again. “You live
here, and the wing will be enough for me. Oh, Heavens, what a joy!”

 The very next day the roof was being painted and the walls whitewashed,
and Olenka, arms akimbo, was going about the yard superintending. Her face
brightened with her old smile. Her whole being revived and freshened, as
though she had awakened from a long sleep. The veterinarian’s wife
and child arrived. She was a thin, plain woman, with a crabbed expression.
The boy Sasha, small for his ten years of age, was a chubby child, with
clear blue eyes and dimples in his cheeks. He made for the kitten the
instant he entered the yard, and the place rang with his happy laughter.

 “Is that your cat, auntie?” he asked Olenka. “When she
has little kitties, please give me one. Mamma is awfully afraid of mice.”

 Olenka chatted with him, gave him tea, and there was a sudden warmth in
her bosom and a soft gripping at her heart, as though the boy were her own
son.

 In the evening, when he sat in the dining-room studying his lessons, she
looked at him tenderly and whispered to herself:

 “My darling, my pretty. You are such a clever child, so good to look
at.”

 “An island is a tract of land entirely surrounded by water,”
he recited.

 “An island is a tract of land,” she repeated—the first
idea asseverated with conviction after so many years of silence and mental
emptiness.

 She now had her opinions, and at supper discussed with Sasha’s
parents how difficult the studies had become for the children at the
gymnasium, but how, after all, a classical education was better than a
commercial course, because when you graduated from the gymnasium then the
road was open to you for any career at all. If you chose to, you could
become a doctor, or, if you wanted to, you could become an engineer.

 Sasha began to go to the gymnasium. His mother left on a visit to her
sister in Kharkov and never came back. The father was away every day
inspecting cattle, and sometimes was gone three whole days at a time, so
that Sasha, it seemed to Olenka, was utterly abandoned, was treated as if
he were quite superfluous, and must be dying of hunger. So she transferred
him into the wing along with herself and fixed up a little room for him
there.

 Every morning Olenka would come into his room and find him sound asleep
with his hand tucked under his cheek, so quiet that he seemed not to be
breathing. What a shame to have to wake him, she thought.

 “Sashenka,” she said sorrowingly, “get up, darling. It’s
time to go to the gymnasium.”

 He got up, dressed, said his prayers, then sat down to drink tea. He drank
three glasses of tea, ate two large cracknels and half a buttered roll.
The sleep was not yet out of him, so he was a little cross.

 “You don’t know your fable as you should, Sashenka,”
said Olenka, looking at him as though he were departing on a long journey.
“What a lot of trouble you are. You must try hard and learn, dear,
and mind your teachers.”

 “Oh, let me alone, please,” said Sasha.

 Then he went down the street to the gymnasium, a little fellow wearing a
large cap and carrying a satchel on his back. Olenka followed him
noiselessly.

 “Sashenka,” she called.

 He looked round and she shoved a date or a caramel into his hand. When he
reached the street of the gymnasium, he turned around and said, ashamed of
being followed by a tall, stout woman:

 “You had better go home, aunt. I can go the rest of the way myself.”

 She stopped and stared after him until he had disappeared into the school
entrance.

 Oh, how she loved him! Not one of her other ties had been so deep. Never
before had she given herself so completely, so disinterestedly, so
cheerfully as now that her maternal instincts were all aroused. For this
boy, who was not hers, for the dimples in his cheeks and for his big cap,
she would have given her life, given it with joy and with tears of
rapture. Why? Ah, indeed, why?

 When she had seen Sasha off to the gymnasium, she returned home quietly,
content, serene, overflowing with love. Her face, which had grown younger
in the last half year, smiled and beamed. People who met her were pleased
as they looked at her.

 “How are you, Olga Semyonovna, darling? How are you getting on,
darling?”

 “The gymnasium course is very hard nowadays,” she told at the
market. “It’s no joke. Yesterday the first class had a fable
to learn by heart, a Latin translation, and a problem. How is a little
fellow to do all that?”

 And she spoke of the teacher and the lessons and the text-books, repeating
exactly what Sasha said about them.

 At three o’clock they had dinner. In the evening they prepared the
lessons together, and Olenka wept with Sasha over the difficulties. When
she put him to bed, she lingered a long time making the sign of the cross
over him and muttering a prayer. And when she lay in bed, she dreamed of
the far-away, misty future when Sasha would finish his studies and become
a doctor or an engineer, have a large house of his own, with horses and a
carriage, marry and have children. She would fall asleep still thinking of
the same things, and tears would roll down her cheeks from her closed
eyes. And the black cat would lie at her side purring: “Mrr, mrr,
mrr.”

 Suddenly there was a loud knocking at the gate. Olenka woke up breathless
with fright, her heart beating violently. Half a minute later there was
another knock.

 “A telegram from Kharkov,” she thought, her whole body in a
tremble. “His mother wants Sasha to come to her in Kharkov. Oh,
great God!”

 She was in despair. Her head, her feet, her hands turned cold. There was
no unhappier creature in the world, she felt. But another minute passed,
she heard voices. It was the veterinarian coming home from the club.

 “Thank God,” she thought. The load gradually fell from her
heart, she was at ease again. And she went back to bed, thinking of Sasha
who lay fast asleep in the next room and sometimes cried out in his sleep:

 “I’ll give it to you! Get away! Quit your scrapping!”
