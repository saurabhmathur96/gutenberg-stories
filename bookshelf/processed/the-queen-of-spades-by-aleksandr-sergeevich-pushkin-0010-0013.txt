THE QUEEN OF SPADES

 BY ALEXSANDR S. PUSHKIN

 T

here was a card party at the rooms of Narumov of the Horse Guards. The
long winter night passed away imperceptibly, and it was five o’clock
in the morning before the company sat down to supper. Those who had won,
ate with a good appetite; the others sat staring absently at their empty
plates. When the champagne appeared, however, the conversation became more
animated, and all took a part in it.

 “And how did you fare, Surin?” asked the host.

 “Oh, I lost, as usual. I must confess that I am unlucky: I play
mirandole, I always keep cool, I never allow anything to put me out, and
yet I always lose!”

 “And you did not once allow yourself to be tempted to back the
red?... Your firmness astonishes me.”

 “But what do you think of Hermann?” said one of the guests,
pointing to a young Engineer: “he has never had a card in his hand
in his life, he has never in his life laid a wager, and yet he sits here
till five o’clock in the morning watching our play.”

 “Play interests me very much,” said Hermann: “but I am
not in the position to sacrifice the necessary in the hope of winning the
superfluous.”

 “Hermann is a German: he is economical—that is all!”
observed Tomsky. “But if there is one person that I cannot
understand, it is my grandmother, the Countess Anna Fedotovna.”

 “How so?” inquired the guests.

 “I cannot understand,” continued Tomsky, “how it is that
my grandmother does not punt.”

 “What is there remarkable about an old lady of eighty not punting?”
said Narumov.

 “Then you do not know the reason why?”

 “No, really; haven’t the faintest idea.”

 “Oh! then listen. About sixty years ago, my grandmother went to
Paris, where she created quite a sensation. People used to run after her
to catch a glimpse of the ‘Muscovite Venus.’ Richelieu made
love to her, and my grandmother maintains that he almost blew out his
brains in consequence of her cruelty. At that time ladies used to play at
faro. On one occasion at the Court, she lost a very considerable sum to
the Duke of Orleans. On returning home, my grandmother removed the patches
from her face, took off her hoops, informed my grandfather of her loss at
the gaming-table, and ordered him to pay the money. My deceased
grandfather, as far as I remember, was a sort of house-steward to my
grandmother. He dreaded her like fire; but, on hearing of such a heavy
loss, he almost went out of his mind; he calculated the various sums she
had lost, and pointed out to her that in six months she had spent half a
million francs, that neither their Moscow nor Saratov estates were in
Paris, and finally refused point blank to pay the debt. My grandmother
gave him a box on the ear and slept by herself as a sign of her
displeasure. The next day she sent for her husband, hoping that this
domestic punishment had produced an effect upon him, but she found him
inflexible. For the first time in her life, she entered into reasonings
and explanations with him, thinking to be able to convince him by pointing
out to him that there are debts and debts, and that there is a great
difference between a Prince and a coachmaker. But it was all in vain, my
grandfather still remained obdurate. But the matter did not rest there. My
grandmother did not know what to do. She had shortly before become
acquainted with a very remarkable man. You have heard of Count St.
Germain, about whom so many marvellous stories are told. You know that he
represented himself as the Wandering Jew, as the discoverer of the elixir
of life, of the philosopher’s stone, and so forth. Some laughed at
him as a charlatan; but Casanova, in his memoirs, says that he was a spy.
But be that as it may, St. Germain, in spite of the mystery surrounding
him, was a very fascinating person, and was much sought after in the best
circles of society. Even to this day my grandmother retains an
affectionate recollection of him, and becomes quite angry if any one
speaks disrespectfully of him. My grandmother knew that St. Germain had
large sums of money at his disposal. She resolved to have recourse to him,
and she wrote a letter to him asking him to come to her without delay. The
queer old man immediately waited upon her and found her overwhelmed with
grief. She described to him in the blackest colours the barbarity of her
husband, and ended by declaring that her whole hope depended upon his
friendship and amiability.

 “St. Germain reflected.

 “‘I could advance you the sum you want,’ said he;
‘but I know that you would not rest easy until you had paid me back,
and I should not like to bring fresh troubles upon you. But there is
another way of getting out of your difficulty: you can win back your
money.’

 “‘But, my dear Count,’ replied my grandmother, ‘I
tell you that I haven’t any money left.’

 “‘Money is not necessary,’ replied St. Germain: ‘be
pleased to listen to me.’

 “Then he revealed to her a secret, for which each of us would give a
good deal...”

 The young officers listened with increased attention. Tomsky lit his pipe,
puffed away for a moment and then continued:

 “That same evening my grandmother went to Versailles to the jeu
de la reine . The Duke of Orleans kept the bank; my grandmother excused
herself in an off-hand manner for not having yet paid her debt, by
inventing some little story, and then began to play against him. She chose
three cards and played them one after the other: all three won sonika ,
[Said of a card when it wins or loses in the quickest possible time.] and
my grandmother recovered every farthing that she had lost.”

 “Mere chance!” said one of the guests.

 “A tale!” observed Hermann.

 “Perhaps they were marked cards!” said a third.

 “I do not think so,” replied Tomsky gravely.

 “What!” said Narumov, “you have a grandmother who knows
how to hit upon three lucky cards in succession, and you have never yet
succeeded in getting the secret of it out of her?”

 “That’s the deuce of it!” replied Tomsky: “she had
four sons, one of whom was my father; all four were determined gamblers,
and yet not to one of them did she ever reveal her secret, although it
would not have been a bad thing either for them or for me. But this is
what I heard from my uncle, Count Ivan Ilyich, and he assured me, on his
honour, that it was true. The late Chaplitzky—the same who died in
poverty after having squandered millions—once lost, in his youth,
about three hundred thousand roubles—to Zorich, if I remember
rightly. He was in despair. My grandmother, who was always very severe
upon the extravagance of young men, took pity, however, upon Chaplitzky.
She gave him three cards, telling him to play them one after the other, at
the same time exacting from him a solemn promise that he would never play
at cards again as long as he lived. Chaplitzky then went to his victorious
opponent, and they began a fresh game. On the first card he staked fifty
thousand rubles and won sonika ; he doubled the stake and won again,
till at last, by pursuing the same tactics, he won back more than he had
lost ...

 “But it is time to go to bed: it is a quarter to six already.”

 And indeed it was already beginning to dawn: the young men emptied their
glasses and then took leave of each other.

 II

 T

he old Countess A—— was seated in her dressing-room in front
of her looking-glass. Three waiting maids stood around her. One held
a small pot of rouge, another a box of hair-pins, and the third a tall can
with bright red ribbons. The Countess had no longer the slightest
pretensions to beauty, but she still preserved the habits of her youth,
dressed in strict accordance with the fashion of seventy years before, and
made as long and as careful a toilette as she would have done sixty years
previously. Near the window, at an embroidery frame, sat a young lady, her
ward.

 “Good morning, grandmamma,” said a young officer, entering the
room. “ Bonjour, Mademoiselle Lise . Grandmamma, I want to ask
you something.”

 “What is it, Paul?”

 “I want you to let me introduce one of my friends to you, and to
allow me to bring him to the ball on Friday.”

 “Bring him direct to the ball and introduce him to me there. Were
you at B——‘s yesterday?”

 “Yes; everything went off very pleasantly, and dancing was kept up
until five o’clock. How charming Yeletzkaya was!”

 “But, my dear, what is there charming about her? Isn’t she
like her grandmother, the Princess Daria Petrovna? By the way, she must be
very old, the Princess Daria Petrovna.”

 “How do you mean, old?” cried Tomsky thoughtlessly; “she
died seven years ago.”

 The young lady raised her head and made a sign to the young officer. He
then remembered that the old Countess was never to be informed of the
death of any of her contemporaries, and he bit his lips. But the old
Countess heard the news with the greatest indifference.

 “Dead!” said she; “and I did not know it. We were
appointed maids of honour at the same time, and when we were presented to
the Empress...”

 And the Countess for the hundredth time related to her grandson one of her
anecdotes.

 “Come, Paul,” said she, when she had finished her story,
“help me to get up. Lizanka, where is my snuff-box?”

 And the Countess with her three maids went behind a screen to finish her
toilette. Tomsky was left alone with the young lady.

 “Who is the gentleman you wish to introduce to the Countess?”
asked Lizaveta Ivanovna in a whisper.

 “Narumov. Do you know him?”

 “No. Is he a soldier or a civilian?”

 “A soldier.”

 “Is he in the Engineers?”

 “No, in the Cavalry. What made you think that he was in the
Engineers?”

 The young lady smiled, but made no reply.

 “Paul,” cried the Countess from behind the screen, “send
me some new novel, only pray don’t let it be one of the present day
style.”

 “What do you mean, grandmother?”

 “That is, a novel, in which the hero strangles neither his father
nor his mother, and in which there are no drowned bodies. I have a great
horror of drowned persons.”

 “There are no such novels nowadays. Would you like a Russian one?”

 “Are there any Russian novels? Send me one, my dear, pray send me
one!”

 “Good-bye, grandmother: I am in a hurry... Good-bye, Lizaveta
Ivanovna. What made you think that Narumov was in the Engineers?”

 And Tomsky left the boudoir.

 Lizaveta Ivanovna was left alone: she laid aside her work and began to
look out of the window. A few moments afterwards, at a corner house on the
other side of the street, a young officer appeared. A deep blush covered
her cheeks; she took up her work again and bent her head down over the
frame. At the same moment the Countess returned completely dressed.

 “Order the carriage, Lizaveta,” said she; “we will go
out for a drive.”

 Lizaveta arose from the frame and began to arrange her work.

 “What is the matter with you, my child, are you deaf?” cried
the Countess. “Order the carriage to be got ready at once.”

 “I will do so this moment,” replied the young lady, hastening
into the ante-room.

 A servant entered and gave the Countess some books from Prince Paul
Aleksandrovich.

 “Tell him that I am much obliged to him,” said the Countess.
“Lizaveta! Lizaveta! Where are you running to?”

 “I am going to dress.”

 “There is plenty of time, my dear. Sit down here. Open the first
volume and read to me aloud.”

 Her companion took the book and read a few lines.

 “Louder,” said the Countess. “What is the matter with
you, my child? Have you lost your voice? Wait—give me that footstool—a
little nearer—that will do.”

 Lizaveta read two more pages. The Countess yawned.

 “Put the book down,” said she: “what a lot of nonsense!
Send it back to Prince Paul with my thanks... But where is the carriage?”

 “The carriage is ready,” said Lizaveta, looking out into the
street.

 “How is it that you are not dressed?” said the Countess:
“I must always wait for you. It is intolerable, my dear!”

 Liza hastened to her room. She had not been there two minutes, before the
Countess began to ring with all her might. The three waiting-maids came
running in at one door and the valet at another.

 “How is it that you cannot hear me when I ring for you?” said
the Countess. “Tell Lizaveta Ivanovna that I am waiting for her.”

 Lizaveta returned with her hat and cloak on.

 “At last you are here!” said the Countess. “But why such
an elaborate toilette? Whom do you intend to captivate? What sort of
weather is it? It seems rather windy.”

 “No, your Ladyship, it is very calm,” replied the valet.

 “You never think of what you are talking about. Open the window. So
it is: windy and bitterly cold. Unharness the horses. Lizaveta, we won’t
go out—there was no need for you to deck yourself like that.”

 “What a life is mine!” thought Lizaveta Ivanovna.

 And, in truth, Lizaveta Ivanovna was a very unfortunate creature. “The
bread of the stranger is bitter,” says Dante, “and his
staircase hard to climb.” But who can know what the bitterness of
dependence is so well as the poor companion of an old lady of quality? The
Countess A—— had by no means a bad heart, but she was
capricious, like a woman who had been spoilt by the world, as well as
being avaricious and egotistical, like all old people who have seen their
best days, and whose thoughts are with the past and not the present. She
participated in all the vanities of the great world, went to balls, where
she sat in a corner, painted and dressed in old-fashioned style, like a
deformed but indispensable ornament of the ball-room; all the guests on
entering approached her and made a profound bow, as if in accordance with
a set ceremony, but after that nobody took any further notice of her. She
received the whole town at her house, and observed the strictest
etiquette, although she could no longer recognise the faces of people. Her
numerous domestics, growing fat and old in her ante-chamber and servants’
hall, did just as they liked, and vied with each other in robbing the aged
Countess in the most bare-faced manner. Lizaveta Ivanovna was the martyr
of the household. She made tea, and was reproached with using too much
sugar; she read novels aloud to the Countess, and the faults of the author
were visited upon her head; she accompanied the Countess in her walks, and
was held answerable for the weather or the state of the pavement. A salary
was attached to the post, but she very rarely received it, although she
was expected to dress like everybody else, that is to say, like very few
indeed. In society she played the most pitiable role. Everybody knew her,
and nobody paid her any attention. At balls she danced only when a partner
was wanted, and ladies would only take hold of her arm when it was
necessary to lead her out of the room to attend to their dresses. She was
very self-conscious, and felt her position keenly, and she looked about
her with impatience for a deliverer to come to her rescue; but the young
men, calculating in their giddiness, honoured her with but very little
attention, although Lizaveta Ivanovna was a hundred times prettier than
the bare-faced and cold-hearted marriageable girls around whom they
hovered. Many a time did she quietly slink away from the glittering but
wearisome drawing-room, to go and cry in her own poor little room, in
which stood a screen, a chest of drawers, a looking-glass and a painted
bedstead, and where a tallow candle burnt feebly in a copper candle-stick.

 One morning—this was about two days after the evening party
described at the beginning of this story, and a week previous to the scene
at which we have just assisted—Lizaveta Ivanovna was seated near the
window at her embroidery frame, when, happening to look out into the
street, she caught sight of a young Engineer officer, standing motionless
with his eyes fixed upon her window. She lowered her head and went on
again with her work. About five minutes afterwards she looked out again—the
young officer was still standing in the same place. Not being in the habit
of coquetting with passing officers, she did not continue to gaze out into
the street, but went on sewing for a couple of hours, without raising her
head. Dinner was announced. She rose up and began to put her embroidery
away, but glancing casually out of the window, she perceived the officer
again. This seemed to her very strange. After dinner she went to the
window with a certain feeling of uneasiness, but the officer was no longer
there—and she thought no more about him.

 A couple of days afterwards, just as she was stepping into the carriage
with the Countess, she saw him again. He was standing close behind the
door, with his face half-concealed by his fur collar, but his dark eyes
sparkled beneath his cap. Lizaveta felt alarmed, though she knew not why,
and she trembled as she seated herself in the carriage.

 On returning home, she hastened to the window—the officer was
standing in his accustomed place, with his eyes fixed upon her. She drew
back, a prey to curiosity and agitated by a feeling which was quite new to
her.

 From that time forward not a day passed without the young officer making
his appearance under the window at the customary hour, and between him and
her there was established a sort of mute acquaintance. Sitting in her
place at work, she used to feel his approach; and raising her head, she
would look at him longer and longer each day. The young man seemed to be
very grateful to her: she saw with the sharp eye of youth, how a sudden
flush covered his pale cheeks each time that their glances met. After
about a week she commenced to smile at him...

 When Tomsky asked permission of his grandmother the Countess to present
one of his friends to her, the young girl’s heart beat violently.
But hearing that Narumov was not an Engineer, she regretted that by her
thoughtless question, she had betrayed her secret to the volatile Tomsky.

 Hermann was the son of a German who had become a naturalised Russian, and
from whom he had inherited a small capital. Being firmly convinced of the
necessity of preserving his independence, Hermann did not touch his
private income, but lived on his pay, without allowing himself the
slightest luxury. Moreover, he was reserved and ambitious, and his
companions rarely had an opportunity of making merry at the expense of his
extreme parsimony. He had strong passions and an ardent imagination, but
his firmness of disposition preserved him from the ordinary errors of
young men. Thus, though a gamester at heart, he never touched a card, for
he considered his position did not allow him—as he said—“to
risk the necessary in the hope of winning the superfluous,” yet he
would sit for nights together at the card table and follow with feverish
anxiety the different turns of the game.

 The story of the three cards had produced a powerful impression upon his
imagination, and all night long he could think of nothing else. “If,”
he thought to himself the following evening, as he walked along the
streets of St. Petersburg, “if the old Countess would but reveal her
secret to me! if she would only tell me the names of the three winning
cards. Why should I not try my fortune? I must get introduced to her and
win her favour—become her lover... But all that will take time, and
she is eighty-seven years old: she might be dead in a week, in a couple of
days even!... But the story itself: can it really be true?... No! Economy,
temperance and industry: those are my three winning cards; by means of
them I shall be able to double my capital—increase it sevenfold, and
procure for myself ease and independence.”

 Musing in this manner, he walked on until he found himself in one of the
principal streets of St. Petersburg, in front of a house of antiquated
architecture. The street was blocked with equipages; carriages one after
the other drew up in front of the brilliantly illuminated doorway. At one
moment there stepped out on to the pavement the well-shaped little foot of
some young beauty, at another the heavy boot of a cavalry officer, and
then the silk stockings and shoes of a member of the diplomatic world.
Furs and cloaks passed in rapid succession before the gigantic porter at
the entrance.

 Hermann stopped. “Whose house is this?” he asked of the
watchman at the corner.

 “The Countess A——‘s,” replied the watchman.

 Hermann started. The strange story of the three cards again presented
itself to his imagination. He began walking up and down before the house,
thinking of its owner and her strange secret. Returning late to his modest
lodging, he could not go to sleep for a long time, and when at last he did
doze off, he could dream of nothing but cards, green tables, piles of
banknotes and heaps of ducats. He played one card after the other, winning
uninterruptedly, and then he gathered up the gold and filled his pockets
with the notes. When he woke up late the next morning, he sighed over the
loss of his imaginary wealth, and then sallying out into the town, he
found himself once more in front of the Countess’s residence. Some
unknown power seemed to have attracted him thither. He stopped and looked
up at the windows. At one of these he saw a head with luxuriant black
hair, which was bent down probably over some book or an embroidery frame.
The head was raised. Hermann saw a fresh complexion and a pair of dark
eyes. That moment decided his fate.

 III

 L

izaveta Ivanovna had scarcely taken off her hat and cloak, when the
Countess sent for her and again ordered her to get the carriage ready. The
vehicle drew up before the door, and they prepared to take their seats.
Just at the moment when two footmen were assisting the old lady to enter
the carriage, Lizaveta saw her Engineer standing close beside the wheel;
he grasped her hand; alarm caused her to lose her presence of mind, and
the young man disappeared—but not before he had left a letter
between her fingers. She concealed it in her glove, and during the whole
of the drive she neither saw nor heard anything. It was the custom of the
Countess, when out for an airing in her carriage, to be constantly asking
such questions as: “Who was that person that met us just now? What
is the name of this bridge? What is written on that signboard?” On
this occasion, however, Lizaveta returned such vague and absurd answers,
that the Countess became angry with her.

 “What is the matter with you, my dear?” she exclaimed. “Have
you taken leave of your senses, or what is it? Do you not hear me or
understand what I say?... Heaven be thanked, I am still in my right mind
and speak plainly enough!”

 Lizaveta Ivanovna did not hear her. On returning home she ran to her room,
and drew the letter out of her glove: it was not sealed. Lizaveta read it.
The letter contained a declaration of love; it was tender, respectful, and
copied word for word from a German novel. But Lizaveta did not know
anything of the German language, and she was quite delighted.

 For all that, the letter caused her to feel exceedingly uneasy. For the
first time in her life she was entering into secret and confidential
relations with a young man. His boldness alarmed her. She reproached
herself for her imprudent behaviour, and knew not what to do. Should she
cease to sit at the window and, by assuming an appearance of indifference
towards him, put a check upon the young officer’s desire for further
acquaintance with her? Should she send his letter back to him, or should
she answer him in a cold and decided manner? There was nobody to whom she
could turn in her perplexity, for she had neither female friend nor
adviser... At length she resolved to reply to him.

 She sat down at her little writing-table, took pen and paper, and began to
think. Several times she began her letter, and then tore it up: the way
she had expressed herself seemed to her either too inviting or too cold
and decisive. At last she succeeded in writing a few lines with which she
felt satisfied.

 “I am convinced,” she wrote, “that your intentions are
honourable, and that you do not wish to offend me by any imprudent
behaviour, but our acquaintance must not begin in such a manner. I return
you your letter, and I hope that I shall never have any cause to complain
of this undeserved slight.”

 The next day, as soon as Hermann made his appearance, Lizaveta rose from
her embroidery, went into the drawing-room, opened the ventilator and
threw the letter into the street, trusting that the young officer would
have the perception to pick it up.

 Hermann hastened forward, picked it up and then repaired to a confectioner’s
shop. Breaking the seal of the envelope, he found inside it his own letter
and Lizaveta’s reply. He had expected this, and he returned home,
his mind deeply occupied with his intrigue.

 Three days afterwards, a bright-eyed young girl from a milliner’s
establishment brought Lizaveta a letter. Lizaveta opened it with great
uneasiness, fearing that it was a demand for money, when suddenly she
recognised Hermann’s hand-writing.

 “You have made a mistake, my dear,” said she: “this
letter is not for me.”

 “Oh, yes, it is for you,” replied the girl, smiling very
knowingly. “Have the goodness to read it.”

 Lizaveta glanced at the letter. Hermann requested an interview.

 “It cannot be,” she cried, alarmed at the audacious request,
and the manner in which it was made. “This letter is certainly not
for me.”

 And she tore it into fragments.

 “If the letter was not for you, why have you torn it up?” said
the girl. “I should have given it back to the person who sent it.”

 “Be good enough, my dear,” said Lizaveta, disconcerted by this
remark, “not to bring me any more letters for the future, and tell
the person who sent you that he ought to be ashamed...”

 But Hermann was not the man to be thus put off. Every day Lizaveta
received from him a letter, sent now in this way, now in that. They were
no longer translated from the German. Hermann wrote them under the
inspiration of passion, and spoke in his own language, and they bore full
testimony to the inflexibility of his desire and the disordered condition
of his uncontrollable imagination. Lizaveta no longer thought of sending
them back to him: she became intoxicated with them and began to reply to
them, and little by little her answers became longer and more
affectionate. At last she threw out of the window to him the following
letter:

 “This evening there is going to be a ball at the Embassy. The
Countess will be there. We shall remain until two o’clock. You have
now an opportunity of seeing me alone. As soon as the Countess is gone,
the servants will very probably go out, and there will be nobody left but
the Swiss, but he usually goes to sleep in his lodge. Come about half-past
eleven. Walk straight upstairs. If you meet anybody in the ante-room, ask
if the Countess is at home. You will be told ‘No,’ in which
case there will be nothing left for you to do but to go away again. But it
is most probable that you will meet nobody. The maidservants will all be
together in one room. On leaving the ante-room, turn to the left, and walk
straight on until you reach the Countess’s bedroom. In the bedroom,
behind a screen, you will find two doors: the one on the right leads to a
cabinet, which the Countess never enters; the one on the left leads to a
corridor, at the end of which is a little winding staircase; this leads to
my room.”

 Hermann trembled like a tiger, as he waited for the appointed time to
arrive. At ten o’clock in the evening he was already in front of the
Countess’s house. The weather was terrible; the wind blew with great
violence; the sleety snow fell in large flakes; the lamps emitted a feeble
light, the streets were deserted; from time to time a sledge, drawn by a
sorry-looking hack, passed by, on the look-out for a belated passenger.
Hermann was enveloped in a thick overcoat, and felt neither wind nor snow.

 At last the Countess’s carriage drew up. Hermann saw two footmen
carry out in their arms the bent form of the old lady, wrapped in sable
fur, and immediately behind her, clad in a warm mantle, and with her head
ornamented with a wreath of fresh flowers, followed Lizaveta. The door was
closed. The carriage rolled away heavily through the yielding snow. The
porter shut the street-door; the windows became dark.

 Hermann began walking up and down near the deserted house; at length he
stopped under a lamp, and glanced at his watch: it was twenty minutes past
eleven. He remained standing under the lamp, his eyes fixed upon the
watch, impatiently waiting for the remaining minutes to pass. At half-past
eleven precisely, Hermann ascended the steps of the house, and made his
way into the brightly-illuminated vestibule. The porter was not there.
Hermann hastily ascended the staircase, opened the door of the ante-room
and saw a footman sitting asleep in an antique chair by the side of a
lamp. With a light firm step Hermann passed by him. The drawing-room and
dining-room were in darkness, but a feeble reflection penetrated thither
from the lamp in the ante-room.

 Hermann reached the Countess’s bedroom. Before a shrine, which was
full of old images, a golden lamp was burning. Faded stuffed chairs and
divans with soft cushions stood in melancholy symmetry around the room,
the walls of which were hung with China silk. On one side of the room hung
two portraits painted in Paris by Madame Lebrun. One of these represented
a stout, red-faced man of about forty years of age in a bright-green
uniform and with a star upon his breast; the other—a beautiful young
woman, with an aquiline nose, forehead curls and a rose in her powdered
hair. In the corners stood porcelain shepherds and shepherdesses,
dining-room clocks from the workshop of the celebrated Lefroy, bandboxes,
roulettes, fans and the various playthings for the amusement of ladies
that were in vogue at the end of the last century, when Montgolfier’s
balloons and Mesmer’s magnetism were the rage. Hermann stepped
behind the screen. At the back of it stood a little iron bedstead; on the
right was the door which led to the cabinet; on the left—the other
which led to the corridor. He opened the latter, and saw the little
winding staircase which led to the room of the poor companion... But he
retraced his steps and entered the dark cabinet.

 The time passed slowly. All was still. The clock in the drawing-room
struck twelve; the strokes echoed through the room one after the other,
and everything was quiet again. Hermann stood leaning against the cold
stove. He was calm; his heart beat regularly, like that of a man resolved
upon a dangerous but inevitable undertaking. One o’clock in the
morning struck; then two; and he heard the distant noise of
carriage-wheels. An involuntary agitation took possession of him. The
carriage drew near and stopped. He heard the sound of the carriage-steps
being let down. All was bustle within the house. The servants were running
hither and thither, there was a confusion of voices, and the rooms were
lit up. Three antiquated chamber-maids entered the bedroom, and they were
shortly afterwards followed by the Countess who, more dead than alive,
sank into a Voltaire armchair. Hermann peeped through a chink. Lizaveta
Ivanovna passed close by him, and he heard her hurried steps as she
hastened up the little spiral staircase. For a moment his heart was
assailed by something like a pricking of conscience, but the emotion was
only transitory, and his heart became petrified as before.

 The Countess began to undress before her looking-glass. Her rose-bedecked
cap was taken off, and then her powdered wig was removed from off her
white and closely-cut hair. Hairpins fell in showers around her. Her
yellow satin dress, brocaded with silver, fell down at her swollen feet.

 Hermann was a witness of the repugnant mysteries of her toilette; at last
the Countess was in her night-cap and dressing-gown, and in this costume,
more suitable to her age, she appeared less hideous and deformed.

 Like all old people in general, the Countess suffered from sleeplessness.
Having undressed, she seated herself at the window in a Voltaire armchair
and dismissed her maids. The candles were taken away, and once more the
room was left with only one lamp burning in it. The Countess sat there
looking quite yellow, mumbling with her flaccid lips and swaying to and
fro. Her dull eyes expressed complete vacancy of mind, and, looking at
her, one would have thought that the rocking of her body was not a
voluntary action of her own, but was produced by the action of some
concealed galvanic mechanism.

 Suddenly the death-like face assumed an inexplicable expression. The lips
ceased to tremble, the eyes became animated: before the Countess stood an
unknown man.

 “Do not be alarmed, for Heaven’s sake, do not be alarmed!”
said he in a low but distinct voice. “I have no intention of doing
you any harm, I have only come to ask a favour of you.”

 The old woman looked at him in silence, as if she had not heard what he
had said. Hermann thought that she was deaf, and bending down towards her
ear, he repeated what he had said. The aged Countess remained silent as
before.

 “You can insure the happiness of my life,” continued Hermann,
“and it will cost you nothing. I know that you can name three cards
in order—”

 Hermann stopped. The Countess appeared now to understand what he wanted;
she seemed as if seeking for words to reply.

 “It was a joke,” she replied at last: “I assure you it
was only a joke.”

 “There is no joking about the matter,” replied Hermann
angrily. “Remember Chaplitzky, whom you helped to win.”

 The Countess became visibly uneasy. Her features expressed strong emotion,
but they quickly resumed their former immobility.

 “Can you not name me these three winning cards?” continued
Hermann.

 The Countess remained silent; Hermann continued:

 “For whom are you preserving your secret? For your grandsons? They
are rich enough without it; they do not know the worth of money. Your
cards would be of no use to a spendthrift. He who cannot preserve his
paternal inheritance, will die in want, even though he had a demon at his
service. I am not a man of that sort; I know the value of money. Your
three cards will not be thrown away upon me. Come!”...

 He paused and tremblingly awaited her reply. The Countess remained silent;
Hermann fell upon his knees.

 “If your heart has ever known the feeling of love,” said he,
“if you remember its rapture, if you have ever smiled at the cry of
your new-born child, if any human feeling has ever entered into your
breast, I entreat you by the feelings of a wife, a lover, a mother, by all
that is most sacred in life, not to reject my prayer. Reveal to me your
secret. Of what use is it to you?... May be it is connected with some
terrible sin with the loss of eternal salvation, with some bargain with
the devil... Reflect,—you are old; you have not long to live—I
am ready to take your sins upon my soul. Only reveal to me your secret.
Remember that the happiness of a man is in your hands, that not only I,
but my children, and grandchildren will bless your memory and reverence
you as a saint...”

 The old Countess answered not a word.

 Hermann rose to his feet.

 “You old hag!” he exclaimed, grinding his teeth, “then I
will make you answer!”

 With these words he drew a pistol from his pocket.

 At the sight of the pistol, the Countess for the second time exhibited
strong emotion. She shook her head and raised her hands as if to protect
herself from the shot... then she fell backwards and remained motionless.

 “Come, an end to this childish nonsense!” said Hermann, taking
hold of her hand. “I ask you for the last time: will you tell me the
names of your three cards, or will you not?”

 The Countess made no reply. Hermann perceived that she was dead!

 IV

 L

izaveta Ivanovna was sitting in her room, still in her ball dress, lost
in deep thought. On returning home, she had hastily dismissed the
chambermaid who very reluctantly came forward to assist her, saying that
she would undress herself, and with a trembling heart had gone up to her
own room, expecting to find Hermann there, but yet hoping not to find him.
At the first glance she convinced herself that he was not there, and she
thanked her fate for having prevented him keeping the appointment. She sat
down without undressing, and began to recall to mind all the circumstances
which in so short a time had carried her so far. It was not three weeks
since the time when she first saw the young officer from the window—and
yet she was already in correspondence with him, and he had succeeded in
inducing her to grant him a nocturnal interview! She knew his name only
through his having written it at the bottom of some of his letters; she
had never spoken to him, had never heard his voice, and had never heard
him spoken of until that evening. But, strange to say, that very evening
at the ball, Tomsky, being piqued with the young Princess Pauline N——,
who, contrary to her usual custom, did not flirt with him, wished to
revenge himself by assuming an air of indifference: he therefore engaged
Lizaveta Ivanovna and danced an endless mazurka with her. During the whole
of the time he kept teasing her about her partiality for Engineer
officers; he assured her that he knew far more than she imagined, and some
of his jests were so happily aimed, that Lizaveta thought several times
that her secret was known to him.

 “From whom have you learnt all this?” she asked, smiling.

 “From a friend of a person very well known to you,” replied
Tomsky, “from a very distinguished man.”

 “And who is this distinguished man?”

 “His name is Hermann.”

 Lizaveta made no reply; but her hands and feet lost all sense of feeling.

 “This Hermann,” continued Tomsky, “is a man of romantic
personality. He has the profile of a Napoleon, and the soul of a
Mephistopheles. I believe that he has at least three crimes upon his
conscience... How pale you have become!”

 “I have a headache... But what did this Hermann—or whatever
his name is—tell you?”

 “Hermann is very much dissatisfied with his friend: he says that in
his place he would act very differently... I even think that Hermann
himself has designs upon you; at least, he listens very attentively to all
that his friend has to say about you.”

 “And where has he seen me?”

 “In church, perhaps; or on the parade—God alone knows where.
It may have been in your room, while you were asleep, for there is nothing
that he—”

 Three ladies approaching him with the question: “ oubli ou regret ?”
interrupted the conversation, which had become so tantalisingly
interesting to Lizaveta.

 The lady chosen by Tomsky was the Princess Pauline herself. She succeeded
in effecting a reconciliation with him during the numerous turns of the
dance, after which he conducted her to her chair. On returning to his
place, Tomsky thought no more either of Hermann or Lizaveta. She longed to
renew the interrupted conversation, but the mazurka came to an end, and
shortly afterwards the old Countess took her departure.

 Tomsky’s words were nothing more than the customary small talk of
the dance, but they sank deep into the soul of the young dreamer. The
portrait, sketched by Tomsky, coincided with the picture she had formed
within her own mind, and thanks to the latest romances, the ordinary
countenance of her admirer became invested with attributes capable of
alarming her and fascinating her imagination at the same time. She was now
sitting with her bare arms crossed and with her head, still adorned with
flowers, sunk upon her uncovered bosom. Suddenly the door opened and
Hermann entered. She shuddered.

 “Where were you?” she asked in a terrified whisper.

 “In the old Countess’s bedroom,” replied Hermann:
“I have just left her. The Countess is dead.”

 “My God! What do you say?”

 “And I am afraid,” added Hermann, “that I am the cause
of her death.”

 Lizaveta looked at him, and Tomsky’s words found an echo in her
soul: “This man has at least three crimes upon his conscience!”
Hermann sat down by the window near her, and related all that had
happened.

 Lizaveta listened to him in terror. So all those passionate letters, those
ardent desires, this bold obstinate pursuit—all this was not love!
Money—that was what his soul yearned for! She could not satisfy his
desire and make him happy! The poor girl had been nothing but the blind
tool of a robber, of the murderer of her aged benefactress!... She wept
bitter tears of agonised repentance. Hermann gazed at her in silence: his
heart, too, was a prey to violent emotion, but neither the tears of the
poor girl, nor the wonderful charm of her beauty, enhanced by her grief,
could produce any impression upon his hardened soul. He felt no pricking
of conscience at the thought of the dead old woman. One thing only grieved
him: the irreparable loss of the secret from which he had expected to
obtain great wealth.

 “You are a monster!” said Lizaveta at last.

 “I did not wish for her death,” replied Hermann: “my
pistol was not loaded.”

 Both remained silent.

 The day began to dawn. Lizaveta extinguished her candle: a pale light
illumined her room. She wiped her tear-stained eyes and raised them
towards Hermann: he was sitting near the window, with his arms crossed and
with a fierce frown upon his forehead. In this attitude he bore a striking
resemblance to the portrait of Napoleon. This resemblance struck Lizaveta
even.

 “How shall I get you out of the house?” said she at last.
“I thought of conducting you down the secret staircase, but in that
case it would be necessary to go through the Countess’s bedroom, and
I am afraid.”

 “Tell me how to find this secret staircase—I will go alone.”

 Lizaveta arose, took from her drawer a key, handed it to Hermann and gave
him the necessary instructions. Hermann pressed her cold, limp hand,
kissed her bowed head, and left the room.

 He descended the winding staircase, and once more entered the Countess’s
bedroom. The dead old lady sat as if petrified; her face expressed
profound tranquillity. Hermann stopped before her, and gazed long and
earnestly at her, as if he wished to convince himself of the terrible
reality; at last he entered the cabinet, felt behind the tapestry for the
door, and then began to descend the dark staircase, filled with strange
emotions. “Down this very staircase,” thought he, “perhaps
coming from the very same room, and at this very same hour sixty years
ago, there may have glided, in an embroidered coat, with his hair dressed à l’oiseau royal and pressing to his heart his three-cornered
hat, some young gallant, who has long been mouldering in the grave, but
the heart of his aged mistress has only to-day ceased to beat...”

 At the bottom of the staircase Hermann found a door, which he opened with
a key, and then traversed a corridor which conducted him into the street.

 V

 T

hree days after the fatal night, at nine o’clock in the morning,
Hermann repaired to the Convent of ——, where the last honours
were to be paid to the mortal remains of the old Countess. Although
feeling no remorse, he could not altogether stifle the voice of
conscience, which said to him: “You are the murderer of the old
woman!” In spite of his entertaining very little religious belief,
he was exceedingly superstitious; and believing that the dead Countess
might exercise an evil influence on his life, he resolved to be present at
her obsequies in order to implore her pardon.

 The church was full. It was with difficulty that Hermann made his way
through the crowd of people. The coffin was placed upon a rich catafalque
beneath a velvet baldachin. The deceased Countess lay within it, with her
hands crossed upon her breast, with a lace cap upon her head and dressed
in a white satin robe. Around the catafalque stood the members of her
household: the servants in black caftans , with armorial ribbons
upon their shoulders, and candles in their hands; the relatives—children,
grandchildren, and great-grandchildren—in deep mourning.

 Nobody wept; tears would have been une affectation . The Countess
was so old, that her death could have surprised nobody, and her relatives
had long looked upon her as being out of the world. A famous preacher
pronounced the funeral sermon. In simple and touching words he described
the peaceful passing away of the righteous, who had passed long years in
calm preparation for a Christian end. “The angel of death found her,”
said the orator, “engaged in pious meditation and waiting for the
midnight bridegroom.”

 The service concluded amidst profound silence. The relatives went forward
first to take farewell of the corpse. Then followed the numerous guests,
who had come to render the last homage to her who for so many years had
been a participator in their frivolous amusements. After these followed
the members of the Countess’s household. The last of these was an
old woman of the same age as the deceased. Two young women led her forward
by the hand. She had not strength enough to bow down to the ground—she
merely shed a few tears and kissed the cold hand of her mistress.

 Hermann now resolved to approach the coffin. He knelt down upon the cold
stones and remained in that position for some minutes; at last he arose,
as pale as the deceased Countess herself; he ascended the steps of the
catafalque and bent over the corpse... At that moment it seemed to him
that the dead woman darted a mocking look at him and winked with one eye.
Hermann started back, took a false step and fell to the ground. Several
persons hurried forward and raised him up. At the same moment Lizaveta
Ivanovna was borne fainting into the porch of the church. This episode
disturbed for some minutes the solemnity of the gloomy ceremony. Among the
congregation arose a deep murmur, and a tall thin chamberlain, a near
relative of the deceased, whispered in the ear of an Englishman who was
standing near him, that the young officer was a natural son of the
Countess, to which the Englishman coldly replied: “Oh!”

 During the whole of that day, Hermann was strangely excited. Repairing to
an out-of-the-way restaurant to dine, he drank a great deal of wine,
contrary to his usual custom, in the hope of deadening his inward
agitation. But the wine only served to excite his imagination still more.
On returning home, he threw himself upon his bed without undressing, and
fell into a deep sleep.

 When he woke up it was already night, and the moon was shining into the
room. He looked at his watch: it was a quarter to three. Sleep had left
him; he sat down upon his bed and thought of the funeral of the old
Countess.

 At that moment somebody in the street looked in at his window, and
immediately passed on again. Hermann paid no attention to this incident. A
few moments afterwards he heard the door of his ante-room open. Hermann
thought that it was his orderly, drunk as usual, returning from some
nocturnal expedition, but presently he heard footsteps that were unknown
to him: somebody was walking softly over the floor in slippers. The door
opened, and a woman dressed in white, entered the room. Hermann mistook
her for his old nurse, and wondered what could bring her there at that
hour of the night. But the white woman glided rapidly across the room and
stood before him—and Hermann recognised the Countess!

 “I have come to you against my wish,” she said in a firm
voice: “but I have been ordered to grant your request. Three, seven,
ace, will win for you if played in succession, but only on these
conditions: that you do not play more than one card in twenty-four hours,
and that you never play again during the rest of your life. I forgive you
my death, on condition that you marry my companion, Lizaveta Ivanovna.”

 With these words she turned round very quietly, walked with a shuffling
gait towards the door and disappeared. Hermann heard the street-door open
and shut, and again he saw some one look in at him through the window.

 For a long time Hermann could not recover himself. He then rose up and
entered the next room. His orderly was lying asleep upon the floor, and he
had much difficulty in waking him. The orderly was drunk as usual, and no
information could be obtained from him. The street-door was locked.
Hermann returned to his room, lit his candle, and wrote down all the
details of his vision.

 VI

 T

wo fixed ideas can no more exist together in the moral world than two
bodies can occupy one and the same place in the physical world. “Three,
seven, ace,” soon drove out of Hermann’s mind the thought of
the dead Countess. “Three, seven, ace,” were perpetually
running through his head and continually being repeated by his lips. If he
saw a young girl, he would say: “How slender she is! quite like the
three of hearts.” If anybody asked: “What is the time?”
he would reply: “Five minutes to seven.” Every stout man that
he saw reminded him of the ace. “Three, seven, ace” haunted
him in his sleep, and assumed all possible shapes. The threes bloomed
before him in the forms of magnificent flowers, the sevens were
represented by Gothic portals, and the aces became transformed into
gigantic spiders. One thought alone occupied his whole mind—to make
a profitable use of the secret which he had purchased so dearly. He
thought of applying for a furlough so as to travel abroad. He wanted to go
to Paris and tempt fortune in some of the public gambling-houses that
abounded there. Chance spared him all this trouble.

 There was in Moscow a society of rich gamesters, presided over by the
celebrated Chekalinsky, who had passed all his life at the card-table and
had amassed millions, accepting bills of exchange for his winnings and
paying his losses in ready money. His long experience secured for him the
confidence of his companions, and his open house, his famous cook, and his
agreeable and fascinating manners gained for him the respect of the
public. He came to St. Petersburg. The young men of the capital flocked to
his rooms, forgetting balls for cards, and preferring the emotions of faro
to the seductions of flirting. Narumov conducted Hermann to Chekalinsky’s
residence.

 They passed through a suite of magnificent rooms, filled with attentive
domestics. The place was crowded. Generals and Privy Counsellors were
playing at whist; young men were lolling carelessly upon the
velvet-covered sofas, eating ices and smoking pipes. In the drawing-room,
at the head of a long table, around which were assembled about a score of
players, sat the master of the house keeping the bank. He was a man of
about sixty years of age, of a very dignified appearance; his head was
covered with silvery-white hair; his full, florid countenance expressed
good-nature, and his eyes twinkled with a perpetual smile. Narumov
introduced Hermann to him. Chekalinsky shook him by the hand in a friendly
manner, requested him not to stand on ceremony, and then went on dealing.

 The game occupied some time. On the table lay more than thirty cards.
Chekalinsky paused after each throw, in order to give the players time to
arrange their cards and note down their losses, listened politely to their
requests, and more politely still, put straight the corners of cards that
some player’s hand had chanced to bend. At last the game was
finished. Chekalinsky shuffled the cards and prepared to deal again.

 “Will you allow me to take a card?” said Hermann, stretching
out his hand from behind a stout gentleman who was punting.

 Chekalinsky smiled and bowed silently, as a sign of acquiescence. Narumov
laughingly congratulated Hermann on his abjuration of that abstention from
cards which he had practised for so long a period, and wished him a lucky
beginning.

 “Stake!” said Hermann, writing some figures with chalk on the
back of his card.

 “How much?” asked the banker, contracting the muscles of his
eyes; “excuse me, I cannot see quite clearly.”

 “Forty-seven thousand rubles,” replied Hermann.

 At these words every head in the room turned suddenly round, and all eyes
were fixed upon Hermann.

 “He has taken leave of his senses!” thought Narumov.

 “Allow me to inform you,” said Chekalinsky, with his eternal
smile, “that you are playing very high; nobody here has ever staked
more than two hundred and seventy-five rubles at once.”

 “Very well,” replied Hermann; “but do you accept my card
or not?”

 Chekalinsky bowed in token of consent.

 “I only wish to observe,” said he, “that although I have
the greatest confidence in my friends, I can only play against ready
money. For my own part, I am quite convinced that your word is sufficient,
but for the sake of the order of the game, and to facilitate the reckoning
up, I must ask you to put the money on your card.”

 Hermann drew from his pocket a bank-note and handed it to Chekalinsky,
who, after examining it in a cursory manner, placed it on Hermann’s
card.

 He began to deal. On the right a nine turned up, and on the left a three.

 “I have won!” said Hermann, showing his card.

 A murmur of astonishment arose among the players. Chekalinsky frowned, but
the smile quickly returned to his face.

 “Do you wish me to settle with you?” he said to Hermann.

 “If you please,” replied the latter.

 Chekalinsky drew from his pocket a number of banknotes and paid at once.
Hermann took up his money and left the table. Narumov could not recover
from his astonishment. Hermann drank a glass of lemonade and returned
home.

 The next evening he again repaired to Chekalinsky’s. The host was
dealing. Hermann walked up to the table; the punters immediately made room
for him. Chekalinsky greeted him with a gracious bow.

 Hermann waited for the next deal, took a card and placed upon it his
forty-seven thousand roubles, together with his winnings of the previous
evening.

 Chekalinsky began to deal. A knave turned up on the right, a seven on the
left.

 Hermann showed his seven.

 There was a general exclamation. Chekalinsky was evidently ill at ease,
but he counted out the ninety-four thousand rubles and handed them over to
Hermann, who pocketed them in the coolest manner possible and immediately
left the house.

 The next evening Hermann appeared again at the table. Every one was
expecting him. The generals and Privy Counsellors left their whist in
order to watch such extraordinary play. The young officers quitted their
sofas, and even the servants crowded into the room. All pressed round
Hermann. The other players left off punting, impatient to see how it would
end. Hermann stood at the table and prepared to play alone against the
pale, but still smiling Chekalinsky. Each opened a pack of cards.
Chekalinsky shuffled. Hermann took a card and covered it with a pile of
bank-notes. It was like a duel. Deep silence reigned around.

 Chekalinsky began to deal; his hands trembled. On the right a queen turned
up, and on the left an ace.

 “Ace has won!” cried Hermann, showing his card.

 “Your queen has lost,” said Chekalinsky, politely.

 Hermann started; instead of an ace, there lay before him the queen of
spades! He could not believe his eyes, nor could he understand how he had
made such a mistake.

 At that moment it seemed to him that the queen of spades smiled ironically
and winked her eye at him. He was struck by her remarkable resemblance...

 “The old Countess!” he exclaimed, seized with terror.

 Chekalinsky gathered up his winnings. For some time, Hermann remained
perfectly motionless. When at last he left the table, there was a general
commotion in the room.

 “Splendidly punted!” said the players. Chekalinsky shuffled
the cards afresh, and the game went on as usual.

  





   





 Hermann went out of his mind, and is now confined in room Number 17 of the
Obukhov Hospital. He never answers any questions, but he constantly
mutters with unusual rapidity: “Three, seven, ace!” “Three,
seven, queen!”

 Lizaveta Ivanovna has married a very amiable young man, a son of the
former steward of the old Countess. He is in the service of the State
somewhere, and is in receipt of a good income. Lizaveta is also supporting
a poor relative.

 Tomsky has been promoted to the rank of captain, and has become the
husband of the Princess Pauline.
