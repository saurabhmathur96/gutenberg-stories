"RINGWORM FRANK"

 BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY

  Jest Frank Reed's his real name—though 

 Boys all calls him "Ringworm Frank," 

 'Cause he allus runs round so.— 

 No man can't tell where to bank 

 Frank 'll be, 

 Next you see 

 Er hear of him!—Drat his melts!— 

 That man's allus somers else ! 



 We're old pards.—But Frank he jest 

 Can't stay still!—Wuz prosper'n here , 

 But lit out on furder West 

 Somers on a ranch, last year: 

 Never heard 

 Nary a word 

 How he liked it, tel to-day, 

 Got this card, reads thisaway:— 



 "Dad-burn climate out here makes 

 Me homesick all Winter long, 

 And when Springtime comes , it takes 

 Two pee-wees to sing one song,— 

 One sings ' pee ' 

 And the other one ' wee !' 

 Stay right where you air, old pard.— 

 Wisht I wuz this postal-card!"
