THE ELIXIR OF LIFE By Honore De Balzac
    

      In a sumptuous palace of Ferrara, one winter evening, Don Juan BelvidÃ©ro
      was entertaining a prince of the house of Este. In those days a banquet
      was a marvelous affair, which demanded princely riches or the power of a
      nobleman. Seven pleasure-loving women chatted gaily around a table lighted
      by perfumed candles, surrounded by admirable works of art whose white
      marble stood out against the walls of red stucco and contrasted with the
      rich Turkey carpets. Clad in satin, glittering with gold and laden with
      gems which sparkled only less brilliantly than their eyes, they all told
      of passions, intense, but of various styles, like their beauty. They
      differed neither in their words nor their ideas; but an expression, a
      look, a motion or an emphasis served as a commentary, unrestrained,
      licentious, melancholy or bantering, to their words.
    

      One seemed to say: “My beauty has power to rekindle the frozen heart
      of age.” Another: “I love to repose on soft cushions and think
      with rapture of my adorers.” A third, a novice at these fÃªtes, was
      inclined to blush. “At the bottom of my heart I feel compunction,”
      she seemed to say. “I am a Catholic and I fear hell; but I love you
      so—ah, so dearly—that I would sacrifice eternity to you!”
      The fourth, emptying a cup of Chian wine, cried: “Hurrah, for
      pleasure! I begin a new existence with each dawn. Forgetful of the past,
      still intoxicated with the violence of yesterday’s pleasures, I
      embrace a new life of happiness, a life filled with love.”
    

      The woman sitting next to BelvidÃ©ro looked at him with flashing eyes. She
      was silent. “I should have no need to call on a bravo to kill my
      lover if he abandoned me.” Then she had laughed; but a comfit dish
      of marvelous workmanship was shattered between her nervous fingers.
    

      “When are you to be grand duke?” asked the sixth of the
      prince, with an expression of murderous glee on her lips and a look of
      Bacchanalian frenzy in her eyes.
    

      “And when is your father going to die?” said the seventh,
      laughing and throwing her bouquet to Don Juan with maddening coquetry. She
      was an innocent young girl who was accustomed to play with sacred things.
    

      “Oh, don’t speak of it!” cried the young and handsome
      Don Juan. “There is only one immortal father in the world, and
      unfortunately he is mine!”
    

      The seven women of Ferrara, the friends of Don Juan, and the prince
      himself gave an exclamation of horror. Two hundred years later, under
      Louis XV, well-bred persons would have laughed at this sally. But perhaps
      at the beginning of an orgy the mind had still an unusual degree of
      lucidity. Despite the heat of the candles, the intensity of the emotions,
      the gold and silver vases, the fumes of wine, despite the vision of
      ravishing women, perhaps there still lurked in the depths of the heart a
      little of that respect for things human and divine which struggles until
      the revel has drowned it in floods of sparkling wine. Nevertheless, the
      flowers were already crushed, the eyes were steeped with drink, and
      intoxication, to quote Rabelais, had reached even to the sandals. In the
      pause that followed a door opened, and, as at the feast of Balthazar, God
      manifested himself. He seemed to command recognition now in the person of
      an old, white-haired servant with unsteady gait and drawn brows; he
      entered with gloomy mien and his look seemed to blight the garlands, the
      ruby cups, the pyramids of fruits, the brightness of the feast, the glow
      of the astonished faces and the colors of the cushions dented by the white
      arms of the women; then he cast a pall over this folly by saying, in a
      hollow voice, the solemn words: “Sir, your father is dying!”
    

      Don Juan rose, making a gesture to his guests, which might be translated:
      “Excuse me, this does not happen every day.”
    

      Does not the death of a parent often overtake young people thus in the
      fulness of life, in the wild enjoyment of an orgy? Death is as unexpected
      in her caprices as a woman in her fancies, but more faithful—Death
      has never duped any one.
    

      When Don Juan had closed the door of the banquet hall and walked down the
      long corridor, which was both cold and dark, he compelled himself to
      assume a mask, for, in thinking of his rÃ´le of son, he had cast off his
      merriment as he threw down his napkin. The night was black. The silent
      servant who conducted the young man to the death chamber, lighted the way
      so insufficiently that Death, aided by the cold, the silence, the gloom,
      perhaps by a reaction of intoxication, was able to force some reflections
      into the soul of the spendthrift; he examined his life, and became
      thoughtful, like a man involved in a lawsuit when he sets out for the
      court of justice.
    

      Bartholomeo BelvidÃ©ro, the father of Don Juan, was an old man of ninety,
      who had devoted the greater part of his life to business. Having traveled
      much in Oriental countries he had acquired there great wealth and learning
      more precious, he said, than gold or diamonds, to which he no longer gave
      more than a passing thought. “I value a tooth more than a ruby,”
      he used to say, smiling, “and power more than knowledge.” This
      good father loved to hear Don Juan relate his youthful adventures, and
      would say, banteringly, as he lavished money upon him: “Only amuse
      yourself, my dear child!” Never did an old man find such pleasure in
      watching a young man. Paternal love robbed age of its terrors in the
      delight of contemplating so brilliant a life.
    

      At the age of sixty, BelvidÃ©ro had become enamored of an angel of peace
      and beauty. Don Juan was the sole fruit of this late love. For fifteen
      years the good man had mourned the loss of his dear Juana. His many
      servants and his son attributed the strange habits he had contracted to
      this grief. Bartholomeo lodged himself in the most uncomfortable wing of
      his palace and rarely went out, and even Don Juan could not intrude into
      his father’s apartment without first obtaining permission. If this
      voluntary recluse came or went in the palace or in the streets of Ferrara
      he seemed to be searching for something which he could not find. He walked
      dreamily, undecidedly, preoccupied like a man battling with an idea or
      with a memory. While the young man gave magnificent entertainments and the
      palace re-echoed his mirth, while the horses pawed the ground in the
      courtyard and the pages quarreled at their game of dice on the stairs,
      Bartholomeo ate seven ounces of bread a day and drank water. If he asked
      for a little poultry it was merely that he might give the bones to a black
      spaniel, his faithful companion. He never complained of the noise. During
      his illness if the blast of horns or the barking of dogs interrupted his
      sleep, he only said: “Ah, Don Juan has come home.” Never
      before was so untroublesome and indulgent a father to be found on this
      earth; consequently young BelvidÃ©ro, accustomed to treat him without
      ceremony, had all the faults of a spoiled child. His attitude toward
      Bartholomeo was like that of a capricious woman toward an elderly lover,
      passing off an impertinence with a smile, selling his good humor and
      submitting to be loved. In calling up the picture of his youth, Don Juan
      recognized that it would be difficult to find an instance in which his
      father’s goodness had failed him. He felt a newborn remorse while he
      traversed the corridor, and he very nearly forgave his father for having
      lived so long. He reverted to feelings of filial piety, as a thief returns
      to honesty in the prospect of enjoying a well-stolen million.
    

      Soon the young man passed into the high, chill rooms of his father’s
      apartment. After feeling a moist atmosphere and breathing the heavy air
      and the musty odor which is given forth by old tapestries and furniture
      covered with dust, he found himself in the antique room of the old man, in
      front of a sick bed and near a dying fire. A lamp standing on a table of
      Gothic shape shed its streams of uneven light sometimes more, sometimes
      less strongly upon the bed and showed the form of the old man in
      ever-varying aspects. The cold air whistled through the insecure windows,
      and the snow beat with a dull sound against the panes.
    

      This scene formed so striking a contrast to the one which Don Juan had
      just left that he could not help shuddering. He felt cold when, on
      approaching the bed, a sudden flare of light, caused by a gust of wind,
      illumined his father’s face. The features were distorted; the skin,
      clinging tightly to the bones, had a greenish tint, which was made the
      more horrible by the whiteness of the pillows on which the old man rested;
      drawn with pain, the mouth, gaping and toothless, gave breath to sighs
      which the howling of the tempest took up and drew out into a dismal wail.
      In spite of these signs of dissolution an incredible expression of power
      shone in the face. The eyes, hallowed by disease, retained a singular
      steadiness. A superior spirit was fighting there with death. It seemed as
      if Bartholomeo sought to kill with his dying look some enemy seated at the
      foot of his bed. This gaze, fixed and cold, was made the more appalling by
      the immobility of the head, which was like a skull standing on a doctor’s
      table. The body, clearly outlined by the coverlet, showed that the dying
      man’s limbs preserved the same rigidity. All was dead, except the
      eyes. There was something mechanical in the sounds which came from the
      mouth. Don Juan felt a certain shame at having come to the deathbed of his
      father with a courtesan’s bouquet on his breast, bringing with him
      the odors of a banquet and the fumes of wine.
    

      “You were enjoying yourself!” cried the old man, on seeing his
      son.
    

      At the same moment the pure, high voice of a singer who entertained the
      guests, strengthened by the chords of the viol by which she was
      accompanied, rose above the roar of the storm and penetrated the chamber
      of death. Don Juan would gladly have shut out this barbarous confirmation
      of his father’s words.
    

      Bartholomeo said: “I do not grudge you your pleasure, my child.”
    

      These words, full of tenderness, pained Don Juan, who could not forgive
      his father for such goodness.
    

      “What, sorrow for me, father!” he cried.
    

      “Poor Juanino,” answered the dying man, “I have always
      been so gentle toward you that you could not wish for my death?”
    

      “Oh!” cried Don Juan, “if it were possible to preserve
      your life by giving you a part of mine!” (“One can always say
      such things,” thought the spendthrift; “it is as if I offered
      the world to my mistress.”)
    

      The thought had scarcely passed through his mind when the old spaniel
      whined. This intelligent voice made Don Juan tremble. He believed that the
      dog understood him.
    

      “I knew that I could count on you, my son,” said the dying
      man. “There, you shall be satisfied. I shall live, but without
      depriving you of a single day of your life.”
    

      “He raves,” said Don Juan to himself.
    

      Then he said, aloud: “Yes, my dearest father, you will indeed live
      as long as I do, for your image will be always in my heart.”
    

      “It is not a question of that sort of life,” said the old
      nobleman, gathering all his strength to raise himself to a sitting
      posture, for he was stirred by one of those suspicions which are only born
      at the bedside of the dying. “Listen, my son,” he continued in
      a voice weakened by this last effort. “I have no more desire to die
      than you have to give up your lady loves, wine, horses, falcons, hounds
      and money——”
    

      “I can well believe it,” thought his son, kneeling beside the
      pillow and kissing one of Bartholomeo’s cadaverous hands. “But,
      father,” he said aloud, “my dear father, we must submit to the
      will of God!”
    

      “God! I am also God!” growled the old man.
    

      “Do not blaspheme!” cried the young man, seeing the menacing
      expression which was overspreading his father’s features. “Be
      careful what you say, for you have received extreme unction and I should
      never be consoled if you were to die in a state of sin.”
    

      “Are you going to listen to me?” cried the dying man, gnashing
      his toothless jaws.
    

      Don Juan held his peace. A horrible silence reigned. Through the dull wail
      of the snowstorm came again the melody of the viol and the heavenly voice,
      faint as the dawning day.
    

      The dying man smiled.
    

      “I thank you for having brought singers and music! A banquet, young
      and beautiful women, with dark locks, all the pleasures of life. Let them
      remain. I am about to be born again.”
    

      “The delirium is at its height,” said Don Juan to himself.
    

      “I have discovered a means of resuscitation. There, look in the
      drawer of the table—you open it by pressing a hidden spring near the
      griffin.”
    

      “I have it, father.”
    

      “Good! Now take out a little flask of rock crystal.”
    

      “Here it is.”
    

      “I have spent twenty years in——”
    

      At this point the old man felt his end approaching, and collected all his
      energy to say:
    

      “As soon as I have drawn my last breath rub me with this water and I
      shall come to life again.”
    

      “There is very little of it,” replied the young man.
    

      Bartholomeo was no longer able to speak, but he could still hear and see.
      At these words he turned his head toward Don Juan with a violent wrench.
      His neck remained twisted like that of a marble statue doomed by the
      sculptor’s whim to look forever sideways, his staring eyes assumed a
      hideous fixity. He was dead, dead in the act of losing his only, his last
      illusion. In seeking a shelter in his son’s heart he had found a
      tomb more hollow than those which men dig for their dead. His hair, too,
      had risen with horror and his tense gaze seemed still to speak. It was a
      father rising in wrath from his sepulchre to demand vengeance of God.
    

      “There, the good man is done for!” exclaimed Don Juan.
    

      Intent upon taking the magic crystal to the light of the lamp, as a
      drinker examines his bottle at the end of a repast, he had not seen his
      father’s eye pale. The cowering dog looked alternately at his dead
      master and at the elixir, as Don Juan regarded by turns his father and the
      phial. The lamp threw out fitful waves of light. The silence was profound,
      the viol was mute. BelvidÃ©ro thought he saw his father move, and he
      trembled. Frightened by the tense expression of the accusing eyes, he
      closed them, just as he would have pushed down a window-blind on an autumn
      night. He stood motionless, lost in a world of thought.
    

      Suddenly a sharp creak, like that of a rusty spring, broke the silence.
      Don Juan, in his surprise, almost dropped the flask. A perspiration,
      colder than the steel of a dagger, oozed out from his pores. A cock of
      painted wood came forth from a clock and crowed three times. It was one of
      those ingenious inventions by which the savants of that time were awakened
      at the hour fixed for their work. Already the daybreak reddened the
      casement. The old timepiece was more faithful in its master’s
      service than Don Juan had been in his duty to Bartholomeo. This instrument
      was composed of wood, pulleys, cords and wheels, while he had that
      mechanism peculiar to man, called a heart.
    

      In order to run no further risk of losing the mysterious liquid the
      skeptical Don Juan replaced it in the drawer of the little Gothic table.
      At this solemn moment he heard a tumult in the corridor. There were
      confused voices, stifled laughter, light footsteps, the rustle of silk, in
      short, the noise of a merry troop trying to collect itself in some sort of
      order. The door opened and the prince, the seven women, the friends of Don
      Juan and the singers, appeared, in the fantastic disorder of dancers
      overtaken by the morning, when the sun disputes the paling light of the
      candles. They came to offer the young heir the conventional condolences.
    

      “Oh, oh, is poor Don Juan really taking this death seriously?”
      said the prince in la Brambilla’s ear.
    

      “Well, his father was a very good man,” she replied.
    

      Nevertheless, Don Juan’s nocturnal meditations had printed so
      striking an expression upon his face that it commanded silence. The men
      stopped, motionless. The women, whose lips had been parched with wine,
      threw themselves on their knees and began to pray. Don Juan could not help
      shuddering as he saw this splendor, this joy, laughter, song, beauty, life
      personified, doing homage thus to Death. But in this adorable Italy
      religion and revelry were on such good terms that religion was a sort of
      debauch and debauch religion. The prince pressed Don Juan’s hand
      affectionately, then all the figures having given expression to the same
      look, half-sympathy, half-indifference, the phantasmagoria disappeared,
      leaving the chamber empty. It was, indeed, a faithful image of life! Going
      down the stairs the prince said to la Rivabarella:
    

      “Heigho! who would have thought Don Juan a mere boaster of impiety?
      He loved his father, after all!”
    

      “Did you notice the black dog?” asked la Brambilla.
    

      “He is immensely rich now,” sighed Bianca Cavatolini.
    

      “What is that to me?” cried the proud Veronese, she who had
      broken the comfit dish.
    

      “What is that to you?” exclaimed the duke. “With his
      ducats he is as much a prince as I am!”
    

      At first Don Juan, swayed by a thousand thoughts, wavered toward many
      different resolutions. After having ascertained the amount of the wealth
      amassed by his father, he returned in the evening to the death chamber,
      his soul puffed up with a horrible egoism. In the apartment he found all
      the servants of the household busied in collecting the ornaments for the
      bed of state on which “feu monseigneur” would lie to-morrow—a
      curious spectacle which all Ferrara would come to admire. Don Juan made a
      sign and the servants stopped at once, speechless and trembling.
    

      “Leave me alone,” he said in an altered voice, “and do
      not return until I go out again.”
    

      When the steps of the old servant, who was the last to leave, had died
      away on the stone flooring, Don Juan locked the door hastily, and, sure
      that he was alone, exclaimed:
    

      “Now, let us try!”
    

      The body of Bartholomeo lay on a long table. To hide the revolting
      spectacle of a corpse whose extreme decrepitude and thinness made it look
      like a skeleton, the embalmers had drawn a sheet over the body, which
      covered all but the head. This mummy-like figure was laid out in the
      middle of the room, and the linen, naturally clinging, outlined the form
      vaguely, but showing its stiff, bony thinness. The face already had large
      purple spots, which showed the urgency of completing the embalming.
      Despite the skepticism with which Don Juan was armed, he trembled as he
      uncorked the magic phial of crystal. When he stood close to the head he
      shook so that he was obliged to pause for a moment. But this young man had
      allowed himself to be corrupted by the customs of a dissolute court. An
      idea worthy of the Duke of Urbino came to him, and gave him a courage
      which was spurred on by lively curiosity. It seemed as if the demon had
      whispered the words which resounded in his heart: “Bathe an eye!”
      He took a piece of linen and, after having moistened it sparingly with the
      precious liquid, he passed it gently over the right eyelid of the corpse.
      The eye opened!
    

      “Ah!” said Don Juan, gripping the flask in his hand as we
      clutch in our dreams the branch by which we are suspended over a
      precipice.
    

      He saw an eye full of life, a child’s eye in a death’s head,
      the liquid eye of youth, in which the light trembled. Protected by
      beautiful black lashes, it scintillated like one of those solitary lights
      which travelers see in lonely places on winter evenings. It seemed as if
      the glowing eye would pierce Don Juan. It thought, accused, condemned,
      threatened, judged, spoke—it cried, it snapped at him! There was the
      most tender supplication, a royal anger, then the love of a young girl
      imploring mercy of her executioners. Finally, the awful look that a man
      casts upon his fellow-men on his way to the scaffold. So much life shone
      in this fragment of life that Don Juan recoiled in terror. He walked up
      and down the room, not daring to look at the eye, which stared back at him
      from the ceiling and from the hangings. The room was sown with points full
      of fire, of life, of intelligence. Everywhere gleamed eyes which shrieked
      at him.
    

      “He might have lived a hundred years longer!” he cried
      involuntarily when, led in front of his father by some diabolical
      influence, he contemplated the luminous spark.
    

      Suddenly the intelligent eye closed, and then opened again abruptly, as if
      assenting. If a voice had cried, “Yes,” Don Juan could not
      have been more startled.
    

      “What is to be done?” he thought
    

      He had the courage to try to close this white eyelid, but his efforts were
      in vain.
    

      “Shall I crush it out? Perhaps that would be parricide?” he
      asked himself.
    

      “Yes,” said the eye, by means of an ironical wink.
    

      “Ah!” cried Don Juan, “there is sorcery in it!”
    

      He approached the eye to crush it. A large tear rolled down the hollow
      cheek of the corpse and fell on BelvidÃ©ro’s hand.
    

      “It is scalding!” he cried, sitting down.
    

      This struggle had exhausted him, as if, like Jacob, he had battled with an
      angel.
    

      At last he arose, saying: “So long as there is no blood—”
    

      Then, collecting all the courage needed for the cowardly act, he crushed
      out the eye, pressing it in with the linen without looking at it. A deep
      moan, startling and terrible, was heard. It was the poor spaniel, who died
      with a howl.
    

      “Could he have been in the secret?” Don Juan wondered,
      surveying the faithful animal.
    

      Don Juan was considered a dutiful son. He raised a monument of white
      marble over his father’s tomb, and employed the most prominent
      artists of the time to carve the figures. He was not altogether at ease
      until the statue of his father, kneeling before Religion, imposed its
      enormous weight on the grave, in which he had buried the only regret that
      had ever touched his heart, and that only in moments of physical
      depression.
    

      On making an inventory of the immense wealth amassed by the old
      Orientalist, Don Juan became avaricious. Had he not two human lives in
      which he should need money? His deep, searching gaze penetrated the
      principles of social life, and he understood the world all the better
      because he viewed it across a tomb. He analyzed men and things that he
      might have done at once with the past, represented by history, with the
      present, expressed by the law, and with the future revealed by religion.
      He took soul and matter, threw them into a crucible, and found nothing
      there, and from that time forth he became Don Juan.
    

      Master of the illusions of life he threw himself—young and beautiful—into
      life; despising the world, but seizing the world. His happiness could
      never be of that bourgeois type which is satisfied by boiled beef, by a
      welcome warming-pan in winter, a lamp at night and new slippers at each
      quarter. He grasped existence as a monkey seizes a nut, peeling off the
      coarse shell to enjoy the savory kernel. The poetry and sublime transports
      of human passion touched no higher than his instep. He never made the
      mistake of those strong men who, imagining that little Souls believe in
      the great, venture to exchange noble thoughts of the future for the small
      coin of our ideas of life. He might, like them, have walked with his feet
      on earth and his head among the clouds, but he preferred to sit at his
      ease and sear with his kisses the lips of more than one tender, fresh and
      sweet woman. Like Death, wherever he passed, he devoured all without
      scruple, demanding a passionate, Oriental love and easily won pleasure.
      Loving only woman in women, his soul found its natural trend in irony.
    

      When his inamoratas mounted to the skies in an ecstasy of bliss, Don Juan
      followed, serious, unreserved, sincere as a German student. But he said
      “I” while his lady love, in her folly, said “we.”
      He knew admirably how to yield himself to a woman’s influence. He
      was always clever enough to make her believe that he trembled like a
      college youth who asks his first partner at a ball: “Do you like
      dancing?” But he could also be terrible when necessary; he could
      draw his sword and destroy skilled soldiers. There was banter in his
      simplicity and laughter in his tears, for he could weep as well as any
      woman who says to her husband: “Give me a carriage or I shall pine
      to death.”
    

      For merchants the world means a bale of goods or a quantity of circulating
      notes; for most young men it is a woman; for some women it is a man; for
      certain natures it is society, a set of people, a position, a city; for
      Don Juan the universe was himself! Noble, fascinating and a model of
      grace, he fastened his bark to every bank; but he allowed himself to be
      carried only where he wished to go. The more he saw the more skeptical he
      became. Probing human nature he soon guessed that courage was rashness;
      prudence, cowardice; generosity, shrewd calculation; justice, a crime;
      delicacy, pusillanimity; honesty, policy; and by a singular fatality he
      perceived that the persons who were really honest, delicate, just,
      generous, prudent and courageous received no consideration at the hands of
      their fellows.
    

      “What a cheerless jest!” he cried. “It does not come
      from a god!”
    

      And then, renouncing a better world, he showed no mark of respect to holy
      things and regarded the marble saints in the churches merely as works of
      art. He understood the mechanism of human society, and never offended too
      much against the current prejudices, for the executioners had more power
      than he; but he bent the social laws to his will with the grace and wit
      that are so well displayed in his scene with M. Dimanche. He was, in
      short, the embodiment of MoliÃ¨re’s Don Juan, Goethe’s Faust,
      Byron’s Manfred, and Maturin’s Melmoth—grand pictures
      drawn by the greatest geniuses of Europe, and to which neither the
      harmonies of Mozart nor the lyric strains of Rossini are lacking. Terrible
      pictures in which the power of evil existing in man is immortalized, and
      which are repeated from one century to another, whether the type come to
      parley with mankind by incarnating itself in Mirabeau, or be content to
      work in silence, like Bonaparte; or to goad on the universe by sarcasm,
      like the divine Rabelais; or again, to laugh at men instead of insulting
      things, like MarÃ©chal de Richelieu; or, still better, perhaps, if it mock
      both men and things, like our most celebrated ambassador.
    

      But the deep genius of Don Juan incorporated in advance all these. He
      played with everything. His life was a mockery, which embraced men,
      things, institutions, ideas. As for eternity, he had chatted for half an
      hour with Pope Julius II., and at the end of the conversation he said,
      laughing:
    

      “If it were absolutely necessary to choose, I should rather believe
      in God than in the devil; power combined with goodness has always more
      possibilities than the spirit of evil.”
    

      “Yes; but God wants one to do penance in this world.”
    

      “Are you always thinking of your indulgences?” replied
      BelvidÃ©ro. “Well, I have a whole existence in reserve to repent the
      faults of my first life.”
    

      “Oh, if that is your idea of old age,” cried the Pope, “you
      are in danger of being canonized.”
    

      “After your elevation to the papacy, one may expect anything.”
    

      And then they went to watch the workmen engaged in building the huge
      basilica consecrated to St. Peter.
    

      “St. Peter is the genius who gave us our double power,” said
      the Pope to Don Juan, “and he deserves this monument. But sometimes
      at night I fancy that a deluge will pass a sponge over all this, and it
      will need to be begun over again.”
    

      Don Juan and the Pope laughed. They understood each other. A fool would
      have gone next day to amuse himself with Julius II at Raphael’s
      house or in the delightful Villa Madama; but BelvidÃ©ro went to see him
      officiate in his pontifical capacity, in order to convince himself of his
      suspicions. Under the influence of wine della Rovere would have been
      capable of forgetting himself and criticising the Apocalypse.
    

      When Don Juan reached the age of sixty he went to live in Spain. There, in
      his old age, he married a young and charming Andalusian. But he was
      intentionally neither a good father nor a good husband. He had observed
      that we are never so tenderly loved as by the women to whom we scarcely
      give a thought. DoÃ±a Elvira, piously reared by an old aunt in the heart of
      Andalusia in a castle several leagues from San Lucas, was all devotion and
      meekness. Don Juan saw that this young girl was a woman to make a long
      fight with a passion before yielding to it, so he hoped to keep from her
      any love but his until after his death. It was a serious jest, a game of
      chess which he had reserved for his old age.
    

      Warned by his father’s mistakes, he determined to make the most
      trifling acts of his old age contribute to the success of the drama which
      was to take place at his deathbed. Therefore, the greater part of his
      wealth lay buried in the cellars of his palace at Ferrara, whither he
      seldom went. The rest of his fortune was invested in a life annuity, so
      that his wife and children might be interested in keeping him alive. This
      was a species of cleverness which his father should have practiced; but
      this Machiavellian scheme was unnecessary in his case. Young Philippe
      BelvidÃ©ro, his son, grew up a Spaniard as conscientiously religious as his
      father was impious, on the principle of the proverb: “A miserly
      father, a spendthrift son.”
    

      The Abbot of San Lucas was selected by Don Juan to direct the consciences
      of the Duchess of BelvidÃ©ro and of Philippe. This ecclesiastic was a holy
      man, of fine carriage, well proportioned, with beautiful black eyes and a
      head like Tiberius. He was wearied with fasting, pale and worn, and
      continually battling with temptation, like all recluses. The old nobleman
      still hoped perhaps to be able to kill a monk before finishing his first
      lease of life. But, whether the Abbot was as clever as Don Juan, or
      whether DoÃ±a Elvira had more prudence or virtue than Spain usually accords
      to women, Don Juan was obliged to pass his last days like a country
      parson, without scandal. Sometimes he took pleasure in finding his wife
      and son remiss in their religious duties, and insisted imperiously that
      they should fulfil all the obligations imposed upon the faithful by the
      court of Rome. He was never so happy as when listening to the gallant
      Abbot of San Lucas, DoÃ±a Elvira and Philippe engaged in arguing a case of
      conscience.
    

      Nevertheless, despite the great care which the lord of BelvidÃ©ro bestowed
      upon his person, the days of decrepitude arrived. With this age of pain
      came cries of helplessness, cries made the more piteous by the remembrance
      of his impetuous youth and his ripe maturity. This man, for whom the last
      jest in the farce was to make others believe in the laws and principles at
      which he scoffed, was compelled to close his eyes at night upon an
      uncertainty. This model of good breeding, this duke spirited in an orgy,
      this brilliant courtier, gracious toward women, whose hearts he had wrung
      as a peasant bends a willow wand, this man of genius, had an obstinate
      cough, a troublesome sciatica and a cruel gout. He saw his teeth leave
      him, as, at the end of an evening, the fairest, best dressed women depart
      one by one, leaving the ballroom deserted and empty. His bold hands
      trembled, his graceful limbs tottered, and then one night apoplexy turned
      its hooked and icy fingers around his throat. From this fateful day he
      became morose and harsh. He accused his wife and son of being insincere in
      their devotion, charging that their touching and gentle care was showered
      upon him so tenderly only because his money was all invested. Elvira and
      Philippe shed bitter tears, and redoubled their caresses to this malicious
      old man, whose broken voice would become affectionate to say:
    

      “My friends, my dear wife, you will forgive me, will you not? I
      torment you sometimes. Ah, great God, how canst Thou make use of me thus
      to prove these two angelic creatures! I, who should be their joy, am their
      bane!”
    

      It was thus that he held them at his bedside, making them forget whole
      months of impatience and cruelty by one hour in which he displayed to them
      the new treasures of his favor and a false tenderness. It was a paternal
      system which succeeded infinitely better than that which his father had
      formerly employed toward him. Finally he reached such a state of illness
      that manoeuvres like those of a small boat entering a dangerous canal were
      necessary in order to put him to bed.
    

      Then the day of death came. This brilliant and skeptical man, whose
      intellect only was left unimpaired by the general decay, lived between a
      doctor and a confessor, his two antipathies. But he was jovial with them.
      Was there not a bright light burning for him behind the veil of the
      future? Over this veil, leaden and impenetrable to others, transparent to
      him, the delicate and bewitching delights of youth played like shadows.
    

      It was on a beautiful summer evening that Don Juan felt the approach of
      death. The Spanish sky was gloriously clear, the orange trees perfumed the
      air and the stars cast a fresh glowing light. Nature seemed to give
      pledges of his resurrection. A pious and obedient son regarded him with
      love and respect. About eleven o’clock he signified his wish to be
      left alone with this sincere being.
    

      “Philippe,” he began, in a voice so tender and affectionate
      that the young man trembled and wept with happiness, for his father had
      never said “Philippe” like this before. “Listen to me,
      my son,” continued the dying man. “I have been a great sinner,
      and all my life I have thought about death. Formerly I was the friend of
      the great Pope Julius II. This illustrious pontiff feared that the
      excessive excitability of my feelings would cause me to commit some deadly
      sin at the moment of my death, after I had received the blessed ointment.
      He made me a present of a flask of holy water that gushed forth from a
      rock in the desert. I kept the secret of the theft of the Church’s
      treasure, but I am authorized to reveal the mystery to my son ‘in
      articulo mortis.’ You will find the flask in the drawer of the
      Gothic table which always stands at my bedside. The precious crystals may
      be of service to you also, my dearest Philippe. Will you swear to me by
      your eternal salvation that you will carry out my orders faithfully?”
    

      Philippe looked at his father. Don Juan was too well versed in human
      expression not to know that he could die peacefully in perfect faith in
      such a look, as his father had died in despair at his own expression.
    

      “You deserve a different father,” continued Don Juan. “I
      must acknowledge that when the estimable Abbot of San Lucas was
      administering the viaticum’ I was thinking of the incompatibility of
      two so wide-spreading powers as that of the devil and that of God.”
    

      “Oh, father!”
    

      “And I said to myself that when Satan makes his peace he will be a
      great idiot if he does not bargain for the pardon of his followers. This
      thought haunted me. So, my child, I shall go to hell if you do not carry
      out my wishes.”
    

      “Oh, tell them to me at once, father!”
    

      “As soon as I have closed my eyes,” replied Don Juan, “and
      that may be in a few minutes, you must take my body, still warm, and lay
      it on a table in the middle of the room. Then put out the lamp—the
      light of the stars will be sufficient. You must take off my clothes, and
      while you recite ‘Paters’ and ‘Aves’ and uplift
      your soul to God, you must moisten my eyes, my lips, all my head first,
      and then my body, with this holy water. But, my dear son, the power of God
      is great. You must not be astonished at anything.”
    

      At this point Don Juan, feeling the approach of death, added in a terrible
      voice: “Be careful of the flask!”
    

      Then he died gently in the arms of his son, whose tears fell upon his
      ironical and sallow face.
    

      It was nearly midnight when Don Philippe BelvidÃ©ro placed his father’s
      corpse on the table. After kissing the stern forehead and the gray hair he
      put out the lamp. The soft rays of the moonlight which cast fantastic
      reflections over the scenery allowed the pious Philippe to discern his
      father’s body dimly, as something white in the midst of the
      darkness. The young man moistened a cloth in the liquid and then, deep in
      prayer, he faithfully anointed the revered head. The silence was intense.
      Then he heard indescribable rustlings, but he attributed them to the wind
      among the tree-tops. When he had bathed the right arm he felt himself
      rudely seized at the back of the neck by an arm, young and vigorous—the
      arm of his father! He gave a piercing cry, and dropped the phial, which
      fell on the floor and broke. The liquid flowed out.
    

      The whole household rushed in, bearing torches. The cry had aroused and
      frightened them as if the trumpet of the last judgment had shaken the
      world. The room was crowded with people. The trembling throng saw Don
      Philippe, fainting, but held up by the powerful arm of his father, which
      clutched his neck. Then they saw a supernatural sight, the head of Don
      Juan, young and beautiful as an AntinoÃ¼s, a head with black hair,
      brilliant eyes and crimson lips, a head that moved in a blood-curdling
      manner without being able to stir the skeleton to which it belonged.
    

      An old servant cried: “A miracle!”
    

      And all the Spaniards repeated: “A miracle!”
    

      Too pious to admit the possibility of magic, DoÃ±a Elvira sent for the
      Abbot of San Lucas. When the priest saw the miracle with his own eyes he
      resolved to profit by it, like a man of sense, and like an abbot who asked
      nothing better than to increase his revenues. Declaring that Don Juan must
      inevitably be canonized, he appointed his monastery for the ceremony of
      the apotheosis. The monastery, he said, should henceforth be called
      “San Juan de Lucas.” At these words the head made a facetious
      grimace.
    

      The taste of the Spaniards for this sort of solemnities is so well known
      that it should not be difficult to imagine the religious spectacle with
      which the abbey of San Lucas celebrated the translation of “the
      blessed Don Juan BelvidÃ©ro” in its church. A few days after the
      death of this illustrious nobleman, the miracle of his partial
      resurrection had been so thoroughly spread from village to village
      throughout a circle of more than fifty leagues round San Lucas that it was
      as good as a play to see the curious people on the road. They came from
      all sides, drawn by the prospect of a “Te Deum” chanted by the
      light of burning torches. The ancient mosque of the monastery of San
      Lucas, a wonderful building, erected by the Moors, which for three hundred
      years had resounded with the name of Jesus Christ instead of Allah, could
      not hold the crowd which was gathered to view the ceremony. Packed
      together like ants, the hidalgos in velvet mantles and armed with their
      good swords stood round the pillars, unable to find room to bend their
      knees, which they never bent elsewhere. Charming peasant women, whose
      dresses set off the beautiful lines of their figures, gave their arms to
      white-haired old men. Youths with glowing eyes found themselves beside old
      women decked out in gala dress. There were couples trembling with
      pleasure, curious-fiancÃ©es, led thither by their sweethearts, newly
      married couples and frightened children, holding one another by the hand.
      All this throng was there, rich in colors, brilliant in contrast, laden
      with flowers, making a soft tumult in the silence of the night. The great
      doors of the church opened.
    

      Those who, having come too late, were obliged to stay outside, saw in the
      distance, through the three open doors, a scene of which the tawdry
      decorations of our modern operas can give but a faint idea. Devotees and
      sinners, intent upon winning the favor of a new saint, lighted thousands
      of candles in his honor inside the vast church, and these scintillating
      lights gave a magical aspect to the edifice. The black arcades, the
      columns with their capitals, the recessed chapels glittering with gold and
      silver, the galleries, the Moorish fretwork, the most delicate features of
      this delicate carving, were all revealed in the dazzling brightness like
      the fantastic figures which are formed in a glowing fire. It was a sea of
      light, surmounted at the end of the church by the gilded choir, where the
      high altar rose in glory, which rivaled the rising sun. But the
      magnificence of the golden lamps, the silver candlesticks, the banners,
      the tassels, the saints and the “ex voto” paled before the
      reliquary in which Don Juan lay. The body of the blasphemer was
      resplendent with gems, flowers, crystals, diamonds, gold, and plumes as
      white as the wings of a seraphim; it replaced a picture of Christ on the
      altar. Around him burned wax candles, which threw out waves of light. The
      good Abbot of San Lucas, clad in his pontifical robes, with his jeweled
      mitre, his surplice and his golden crozier reclined, king of the choir, in
      a large armchair, amid all his clergy, who were impassive men with silver
      hair, and who surrounded him like the confessing saints whom the painters
      group round the Lord. The precentor and the dignitaries of the order,
      decorated with the glittering insignia of their ecclesiastical vanities,
      came and went among the clouds of incense like planets revolving in the
      firmament.
    

      When the hour of triumph was come the chimes awoke the echoes of the
      countryside, and this immense assembly raised its voice to God in the
      first cry of praise which begins the “Te Deum.”
    

      Sublime exultation! There were voices pure and high, ecstatic women’s
      voices, blended with the deep sonorous tones of the men, thousands of
      voices so powerful that they drowned the organ in spite of the bellowing
      of its pipes. The shrill notes of the choir-boys and the powerful rhythm
      of the basses inspired pretty thoughts of the combination of childhood and
      strength in this delightful concert of human voices blended in an
      outpouring of love.
    

      “Te Deum laudamus!”
    

      In the midst of this cathedral, black with kneeling men and women, the
      chant burst forth like a light which gleams suddenly in the night, and the
      silence was broken as by a peal of thunder. The voices rose with the
      clouds of incense which threw diaphanous, bluish veils over the quaint
      marvels of the architecture. All was richness, perfume, light and melody.
    

      At the moment at which this symphony of love and gratitude rolled toward
      the altar, Don Juan, too polite not to express his thanks and too witty
      not to appreciate a jest, responded by a frightful laugh, and straightened
      up in his reliquary. But, the devil having given him a hint of the danger
      he ran of being taken for an ordinary man, for a saint, a Boniface or a
      PantalÃ©on, he interrupted this harmony of love by a shriek in which the
      thousand voices of hell joined. Earth lauded, heaven condemned. The church
      trembled on its ancient foundations.
    

      “Te Deum laudamus!” sang the crowd.
    

      “Go to the devil, brute beasts that you are! ‘Carajos
      demonios!’ Beasts! what idiots you are with your God!”
    

      And a torrent of curses rolled forth like a stream of burning lava at an
      eruption of Vesuvius.
    

      “‘Deus sabaoth! sabaoth’!” cried the Christians.
    

      Then the living arm was thrust out of the reliquary and waved
      threateningly over the assembly with a gesture full of despair and irony.
    

      “The saint is blessing us!” said the credulous old women, the
      children and the young maids.
    

      It is thus that we are often deceived in our adorations. The superior man
      mocks those who compliment him, and compliments those whom he mocks in the
      depths of his heart.
    

      When the Abbot, bowing low before the altar, chanted: “‘Sancte
      Johannes, ora pro nobis’!” he heard distinctly: “‘O
      coglione’!”
    

      “What is happening up there?” cried the superior, seeing the
      reliquary move.
    

      “The saint is playing devil!” replied the Abbot.
    

      At this the living head tore itself violently away from the dead body and
      fell upon the yellow pate of the priest.
    

      “Remember, DoÃ±a Elvira!” cried the head, fastening its teeth
      in the head of the Abbot.
    

      The latter gave a terrible shriek, which threw the crowd into a panic. The
      priests rushed to the assistance of their chief.
    

      “Imbecile! Now say that there is a God!” cried the voice, just
      as the Abbot expired.
