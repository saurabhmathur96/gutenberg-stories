THE TWO BUSINESS MEN

 BY CAROLYN WELLS

 Once on a Time two Business Men were Each Confronted with what seemed to
be a Fine Chance to Make Money.

 One Man, being of a Cautious and Prudent Nature, said: "I will not Take
Hold of this Matter until I have Carefully Examined it in All its
Aspects and Inquired into All its Details."

 While he was thus Occupied in a thorough Investigation he Lost his
Chance of becoming a Partner in the Project, and as It proved to be a
Booming Success, he was Much Chagrined.

 The Other Man, when he saw a Golden Opportunity Looming Up Before him,
Embraced it at once, without a Preliminary Question or Doubt.

 But alas! after he had Invested all his Fortune in it, the Scheme proved
to be Worthless, and he Lost all his Money.

Look Before you Leap.
