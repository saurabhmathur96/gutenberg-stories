THE WICKED ZEBRA
BY FRANK ROE BATCHELDER

The zebra always seems malicious,â€”
He kicks and bites 'most all the time;
I fear that he's not only vicious,
But guilty of some dreadful crime.

The mere suggestion makes me falter
In writing of this wicked brute;
Although he has escaped the halter,
He wears for life a convict's suit.
