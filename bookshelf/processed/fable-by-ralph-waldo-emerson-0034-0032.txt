FABLE

 BY RALPH WALDO EMERSON

  The mountain and the squirrel 

 Had a quarrel, 

 And the former called the latter "Little Prig"; 

 Bun replied, 

 "You are doubtless very big; 

 But all sorts of things and weather 

 Must be taken in together, 

 To make up a year 

 And a sphere, 

 And I think it no disgrace 

 To occupy my place. 

 If I'm not so large as you, 

 You are not so small as I, 

 And not half so spry. 

 I'll not deny you make 

 A very pretty squirrel track; 

 Talents differ; all is well and wisely put; 

 If I can not carry forests on my back, 

 Neither can you crack a nut."
