THE ADVERTISER

 BY EUGENE FIELD

  I am an advertiser great! 

 In letters bold 

 The praises of my wares I sound, 

 Prosperity is my estate; 

 The people come, 

 The people go 

 In one continuous, 

 Surging flow. 

 They buy my goods and come again 

 And I'm the happiest of men; 

 And this the reason I relate, 

 I'm an advertiser great! 



 There is a shop across the way 

 Where ne'er is heard a human tread, 

 Where trade is paralyzed and dead, 

 With ne'er a customer a day. 

 The people come, 

 The people go, 

 But never there. 

 They do not know 

 There's such a shop beneath the skies, 

 Because he does not advertise! 

 While I with pleasure contemplate 

 That I'm an advertiser great.





 The secret of my fortune lies 

 In one small fact, which I may state, 

 Too many tradesmen learn too late, 

 If I have goods, I advertise. 

 Then people come 

 And people go 

 In constant streams, 

 For people know 

 That he who has good wares to sell 

 Will surely advertise them well; 

 And proudly I reiterate, 

 I am an advertiser great!
