bottom, all perished save me. I swam several miles through the
billows, and at last, utterly exhausted, gave up all hope of life.
Suddenly I stepped on something hard. It was the United States.

 "And now, my brave boy," exclaimed the man with great glee, "see what I
have brought for you." It was but the work of a moment to unclasp from a
shawl-strap which he held in his hand and present to George's astonished
gaze a large forty-cent watermelon, which until now had been concealed
by the shawl-strap.

  SIMPLE ENGLISH

 BY RAY CLARKE ROSE

  Ofttimes when I put on my gloves, 

 I wonder if I'm sane. 

 For when I put the right one on, 

 The right seems to remain 

 To be put onâ€”that is, 'tis left; 

 Yet if the left I don, 

 The other one is left, and then 

 I have the right one on. 

 But still I have the left on right; 

 The right one, though, is left 

 To go right on the left right hand 

 All right, if I am deft.
