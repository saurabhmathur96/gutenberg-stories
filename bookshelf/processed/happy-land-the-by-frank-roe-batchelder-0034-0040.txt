THE HAPPY LAND  BY FRANK ROE BATCHELDER

  In the Land of Steady Incomes, 

 Where they get their ten per cent., 

 There is never need to worry 

 As to how to pay the rent; 

 There they never dodge the grocer, 

 And in winter never freeze, 

 In the Land of Steady Incomes, 

 Where the dollars grow on trees. 



 In the Land of Steady Incomes, 

 Where the cash is ready-made, 

 No one ever thinks of going 

 To the almoner for aid, 

 For the coal-bin's never empty, 

 And the Gray Wolf dare not lurk 

 In the Land of Steady Incomes, 

 Where the check-books do the work. 



 In the Land of Steady Incomes, 

 Where the watches all have fobs, 

 You will see no haggard fathers 

 Pleading, in despair, for jobs; 

 You will hear no hungry children 

 Crying, while their mothers pray, 

 In the Land of Steady Incomes, 

 Where there's dinner every day. 

  In the Land of Steady Incomes, 

 It is easy to forget 

 All about that far-off country 

 Where are hunger, cold, and debt; 

 And the woes of other people 

 It is easy to dismiss 

 In the Land of Steady Incomes, 

 Where inheritance is bliss.
