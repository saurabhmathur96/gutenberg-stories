THE CELEBRATED JUMPING FROG OF CALAVERAS COUNTY

 By Mark Twain (1835-1910)

 [From The Saturday Press , Nov. 18, 1865. Republished in The
      Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, and Other Sketches (1867), by Mark Twain, all of whose works are published by Harper &
      Brothers.]

 In compliance with the request of a friend of mine, who wrote me from the
      East, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler, and inquired
      after my friend's friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as requested to do, and I
      hereunto append the result. I have a lurking suspicion that Leonidas W .
      Smiley is a myth; and that my friend never knew such a personage; and that
      he only conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler about him, it would remind
      him of his infamous Jim Smiley , and he would go to work and bore me
      to death with some exasperating reminiscence of him as long and as tedious
      as it should be useless to me. If that was the design, it succeeded.

 I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the barroom stove of the
      dilapidated tavern in the decayed mining camp of Angel's, and I noticed
      that he was fat and bald-headed, and had an expression of winning
      gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance. He roused up, and
      gave me good-day. I told him a friend had commissioned me to make some
      inquiries about a cherished companion of his boyhood named Leonidas W .
      Smiley— Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, a young minister of the
      Gospel, who he had heard was at one time a resident of Angel's Camp. I
      added that if Mr. Wheeler could tell me anything about this Rev. Leonidas
      W. Smiley, I would feel under many obligations to him.

 Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his
      chair, and then sat down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which
      follows this paragraph. He never smiled, he never frowned, he never
      changed his voice from the gentle-flowing key to which he tuned his
      initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm;
      but all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein of impressive
      earnestness and sincerity, which showed me plainly that, so far from his
      imagining that there was anything ridiculous or funny about his story, he
      regarded it as a really important matter, and admired its two heroes as
      men of transcendent genius in finesse . I let him go on in his own
      way, and never interrupted him once.

 "Rev. Leonidas W. H'm, Reverend Le—well, there was a feller here
      once by the name of Jim Smiley, in the winter of '49—or may
      be it was the spring of '50—I don't recollect exactly, somehow,
      though what makes me think it was one or the other is because I remember
      the big flume warn't finished when he first came to the camp; but any way,
      he was the curiousest man about always betting on anything that turned up
      you ever see, if he could get anybody to bet on the other side; and if he
      couldn't he'd change sides. Any way that suited the other man would suit him —any way just so's he got a bet, he was satisfied.
      But still he was lucky, uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner. He
      was always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn't be no solit'ry
      thing mentioned but that feller'd offer to bet on it, and take any side
      you please, as I was just telling you. If there was a horse-race, you'd
      find him flush or you'd find him busted at the end of it; if there was a
      dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if
      there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds
      setting on a fence, he would bet you which one would fly first; or if
      there was a camp-meeting, he would be there reg'lar to bet on Parson
      Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and he was,
      too, and a good man. If he even see a straddle-bug start to go anywheres,
      he would bet you how long it would take him to get to—to wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he would foller that
      straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for
      and how long he was on the road. Lots of the boys here has seen that
      Smiley and can tell you about him. Why, it never made no difference to him —he'd
      bet on any thing—the dangest feller. Parson Walker's wife
      laid very sick once, for a good while, and it seemed as if they warn't
      going to save her; but one morning he come in, and Smiley up and asked him
      how she was, and he said she was considerable better—thank the Lord
      for his inf'nit' mercy—and coming on so smart that with the blessing
      of Prov'dence she'd get well yet; and Smiley, before he thought, says,
      Well, I'll risk two-and-a-half she don't anyway.'"

 Thish-yer Smiley had a mare—the boys called her the fifteen-minute
      nag, but that was only in fun, you know, because, of course, she was
      faster than that—and he used to win money on that horse, for all she
      was so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or the
      consumption, or something of that kind. They used to give her two or three
      hundred yards start, and then pass her under way; but always at the
      fag-end of the race she'd get excited and desperate-like, and come
      cavorting and straddling up, and scattering her legs around limber,
      sometimes in the air, and sometimes out to one side amongst the fences,
      and kicking up m-o-r-e dust and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing
      and sneezing and blowing her nose—and always fetch up at the stand
      just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it down.

 And he had a little small bull-pup, that to look at him you'd think he
      warn't worth a cent but to set around and look ornery and lay for a chance
      to steal something. But as soon as money was up on him he was a different
      dog; his under-jaw'd begin to stick out like the fo'-castle of a
      steamboat, and his teeth would uncover and shine like the furnaces. And a
      dog might tackle him and bully-rag him, and bite him, and throw him over
      his shoulder two or three times, and Andrew Jackson—which was the
      name of the pup—Andrew Jackson would never let on but what he was satisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else—and the bets being
      doubled and doubled on the other side all the time, till the money was all
      up; and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the
      j'int of his hind leg and freeze to it—not chaw, you understand, but
      only just grip and hang on till they throwed up the sponge, if it was a
      year. Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he harnessed a dog
      once that didn't have no hind legs, because they'd been sawed off in a
      circular saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and the money
      was all up, and he come to make a snatch for his pet holt, he see in a
      minute how he'd been imposed on, and how the other dog had him in the
      door, so to speak, and he 'peared surprised, and then he looked sorter
      discouraged-like, and didn't try no more to win the fight, and so he got
      shucked out bad. He gave Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was
      broke, and it was his fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no
      hind legs for him to take holt of, which was his main dependence in a
      fight, and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It was a
      good pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself
      if he'd lived, for the stuff was in him and he had genius—I know it,
      because he hadn't no opportunities to speak of, and it don't stand to
      reason that a dog could make such a fight as he could under them
      circumstances if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel sorry when I
      think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it turned out.

 Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tom-cats
      and all of them kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and you couldn't
      fetch nothing for him to bet on but he'd match you. He ketched a frog one
      day, and took him home, and said he cal'lated to educate him; and so he
      never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn
      that frog to jump. And you bet you he did learn him, too. He'd give
      him a little punch behind, and the next minute you'd see that frog
      whirling in the air like a doughnut—see him turn one summerset, or
      may be a couple, if he got a good start, and come down flat-footed and all
      right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching flies, and
      kep' him in practice so constant, that he'd nail a fly every time as fur
      as he could see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and he
      could do 'most anything—and I believe him. Why, I've seen him set
      Dan'l Webster down here on this floor—Dan'l Webster was the name of
      the frog—and sing out, "Flies, Dan'l, flies!" and quicker'n you
      could wink he'd spring straight up and snake a fly off'n the counter
      there, and flop down on the floor ag'in as solid as a gob of mud, and fall
      to scratching the side of his head with his hind foot as indifferent as if
      he hadn't no idea he'd been doin' any more'n any frog might do. You never
      see a frog so modest and straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so
      gifted. And when it come to fair and square jumping on a dead level, he
      could get over more ground at one straddle than any animal of his breed
      you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong suit, you understand;
      and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he
      had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be,
      for fellers that had traveled and been everywheres, all said he laid over
      any frog that ever they see.

 Well, Smiley kep' the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to fetch
      him downtown sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller—a
      stranger in the camp, he was—come acrost him with his box, and says:

 "What might be that you've got in the box?"

 And Smiley says, sorter indifferent-like, "It might be a parrot, or it
      might be a canary, maybe, but it ain't—it's only just a frog."

 And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round this
      way and that, and says, "H'm—so 'tis. Well, what's he good
      for?"

 "Well," Smiley says, easy and careless, "he's good enough for one thing, I should judge—he can outjump any frog in Calaveras county."

 The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular look, and
      give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate, "Well," he says, "I
      don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog."

 "Maybe you don't," Smiley says. "Maybe you understand frogs and maybe you
      don't understand 'em; maybe you've had experience, and maybe you ain't
      only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I've got my opinion and I'll
      risk forty dollars that he can outjump any frog in Calaveras County."

 And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad like, "Well,
      I'm only a stranger here, and I ain't got no frog; but if I had a frog,
      I'd bet you."

 And then Smiley says, "That's all right—that's all right—if
      you'll hold my box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog." And so the
      feller took the box, and put up his forty dollars along with Smiley's, and
      set down to wait.

 So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to his-self, and then
      he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon and
      filled him full of quail shot—filled! him pretty near up to his chin—and
      set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp and slopped around in
      the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him
      in, and give him to this feller, and says:

 "Now, if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his forepaws just
      even with Dan'l's, and I'll give the word." Then he says, "One—two—three— git !"
      and him and the feller touched up the frogs from behind, and the new frog
      hopped off lively, but Dan'l give a heave, and hysted up his shoulders—so—like
      a Frenchman, but it warn't no use—he couldn't budge; he was planted
      as solid as a church, and he couldn't no more stir than if he was anchored
      out. Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he
      didn't have no idea what the matter was, of course.

 The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out at
      the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulder—so—at
      Dan'l, and says again, very deliberate, "Well," he says, " I don't
      see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog."

 Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a long time,
      and at last says, "I do wonder what in the nation that frog throwed off
      for—I wonder if there ain't something the matter with him—he
      'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow." And he ketched Dan'l up by the nap
      of the neck, and hefted him, and says, "Why blame my cats if he don't
      weigh five pounds!" and turned him upside down and he belched out a double
      handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest man—he
      set the frog down and took out after that feller, but he never ketched
      him. And——

 (Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got up
      to see what was wanted.) And turning to me as he moved away, he said:
      "Just set where you are, stranger, and rest easy—I ain't going to be
      gone a second."

 But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history of
      the enterprising vagabond Jim Smiley would be likely to afford me
      much information concerning the Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, and so I
      started away.

 At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he buttonholed me
      and recommenced:

 "Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yaller, one-eyed cow that didn't have no
      tail, only jest a short stump like a bannanner, and——"

 However, lacking both time and inclination, I did not wait to hear about
      the afflicted cow, but took my leave.
