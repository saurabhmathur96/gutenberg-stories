IN ELIZABETH'S DAY

 BY WALLACE RICE

  Who would not give the treasure 

 Of very many lives 

 If some kind fate would pleasure 

 To let him be where Ben is 

 A-playing Kit at tennis, 

 Or playing Will at fives? 



 The racquet ne'er so deftly 

 Is turned, whoever strives, 

 The ball flies ne'er so swiftly 

 As thought and tongue where Ben is 

 A-playing Kit at tennis, 

 Or playing Will at fives.
