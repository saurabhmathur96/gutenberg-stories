DESOLATION  BY TOM MASSON

  Somewhat back from the village street 

 Stands the old-fashioned country seat. 

 Across its antique portico 

 Tall poplar trees their shadows throw. 

 And there throughout the livelong day, 

 Jemima plays the pi-a-na. 

 Do, re, mi, 

 Mi, re, do. 



 In the front parlor, there it stands, 

 And there Jemima plies her hands, 

 While her papa beneath his cloak, 

 Mutters and groans: "This is no joke!" 

 And swears to himself and sighs, alas! 

 With sorrowful voice to all who pass. 

 Do, re, mi, 

 Mi, re, do. 



 Through days of death and days of birth 

 She plays as if she owned the earth. 

 Through every swift vicissitude 

 She drums as if it did her good, 

 And still she sits from morn till night 

 And plunks away with main and might, 

 Do, re, mi, 

 Mi, re, do. 



 In that mansion used to be 

 Free-hearted hospitality; 

 But that was many years before 

 Jemima monkeyed with the score. 

 When she began her daily plunk, 

 Into their graves the neighbors sunk. 

 Do, re, mi, 

 Mi, re, do. 



 To other worlds they've long since fled, 

 All thankful that they're safely dead. 

 They stood the racket while alive 

 Until Jemima rose at five. 

 And then they laid their burdens down, 

 And one and all they skipped the town. 

 Do, re, mi, 

 Mi, re, do.
