THE RHYME OF THE CHIVALROUS SHARK  BY WALLACE IRWIN

  Most chivalrous fish of the ocean, 

 To ladies forbearing and mild, 

 Though his record be dark, is the man-eating shark 

 Who will eat neither woman nor child. 



 He dines upon seamen and skippers, 

 And tourists his hunger assuage, 

 And a fresh cabin boy will inspire him with joy 

 If he's past the maturity age. 



 A doctor, a lawyer, a preacher, 

 He'll gobble one any fine day, 

 But the ladies, God bless 'em, he'll only address 'em 

 Politely and go on his way. 



 I can readily cite you an instance 

 Where a lovely young lady of Breem, 

 Who was tender and sweet and delicious to eat, 

 Fell into the bay with a scream. 



 She struggled and flounced in the water 

 And signaled in vain for her bark, 

 And she'd surely been drowned if she hadn't been found 

 By a chivalrous man-eating shark. 



 He bowed in a manner most polished, 

 Thus soothing her impulses wild; 

 "Don't be frightened," he said, "I've been properly bred 

 And will eat neither woman nor child." 

  Then he proffered his fin and she took it— 

 Such a gallantry none can dispute— 

 While the passengers cheered as the vessel they neared 

 And a broadside was fired in salute. 



 And they soon stood alongside the vessel, 

 When a life-saving dingey was lowered 

 With the pick of the crew, and her relatives, too, 

 And the mate and the skipper aboard. 



 So they took her aboard in a jiffy, 

 And the shark stood attention the while, 

 Then he raised on his flipper and ate up the skipper 

 And went on his way with a smile. 



 And this shows that the prince of the ocean, 

 To ladies forbearing and mild, 

 Though his record be dark, is the man-eating shark 

 Who will eat neither woman nor child.
