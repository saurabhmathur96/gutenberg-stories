What Was It?

 By FITZ-JAMES O'BRIEN

 It is, I confess, with considerable diffidence, that I
    approach the strange narrative which I am about to relate. The
    events which I purpose detailing are of so extraordinary a
    character that I am quite prepared to meet with an unusual
    amount of incredulity and scorn. I accept all such beforehand.
    I have, I trust, the literary courage to face unbelief. I have,
    after mature consideration resolved to narrate, in as simple
    and straightforward a manner as I can compass, some facts that
    passed under my observation, in the month of July last, and
    which, in the annals of the mysteries of physical science, are
    wholly unparalleled.

 I live at No. —— Twenty-sixth Street, in New
    York. The house is in some respects a curious one. It has
    enjoyed for the last two years the reputation of being haunted.
    It is a large and stately residence, surrounded by what was
    once a garden, but which is now only a green enclosure used for
    bleaching clothes. The dry basin of what has been a fountain,
    and a few fruit trees ragged and unpruned, indicate that this
    spot in past days was a pleasant, shady retreat, filled with
    fruits and flowers and the sweet murmur of waters.

 The house is very spacious. A hall of noble size leads to a
    large spiral staircase winding through its center, while the
    various apartments are of imposing dimensions. It was built
    some fifteen or twenty years since by Mr. A——, the
    well-known New York merchant, who five years ago threw the
    commercial world into convulsions by a stupendous bank fraud.
    Mr. A——, as everyone knows, escaped to Europe, and
    died not long after, of a broken heart. Almost immediately
    after the news of his decease reached this country and was
    verified, the report spread in Twenty-sixth Street that No.
    —— was haunted. Legal measures had dispossessed the
    widow of its former owner, and it was inhabited merely by a
    caretaker and his wife, placed there by the house agent into
    whose hands it had passed for the purposes of renting or sale.
    These people declared that they were troubled with unnatural
    noises. Doors were opened without any visible agency. The
    remnants of furniture scattered through the various rooms were,
    during the night, piled one upon the other by unknown hands.
    Invisible feet passed up and down the stairs in broad daylight,
    accompanied by the rustle of unseen silk dresses, and the
    gliding of viewless hands along the massive balusters. The
    caretaker and his wife declared they would live there no
    longer. The house agent laughed, dismissed them, and put others
    in their place. The noises and supernatural manifestations
    continued. The neighborhood caught up the story, and the house
    remained untenanted for three years. Several persons negotiated
    for it; but, somehow, always before the bargain was closed they
    heard the unpleasant rumors and declined to treat any
    further.

 It was in this state of things that my landlady, who at that
    time kept a boarding-house in Bleecker Street, and who wished
    to move further up town, conceived the bold idea of renting No.
    —— Twenty-sixth Street. Happening to have in her
    house rather a plucky and philosophical set of boarders, she
    laid her scheme before us, stating candidly everything she had
    heard respecting the ghostly qualities of the establishment to
    which she wished to remove us. With the exception of two timid
    persons,—a sea-captain and a returned Californian, who
    immediately gave notice that they would leave,—all of
    Mrs. Moffat's guests declared that they would accompany her in
    her chivalric incursion into the abode of spirits.

 Our removal was effected in the month of May, and we were
    charmed with our new residence. The portion of Twenty-sixth
    Street where our house is situated, between Seventh and Eighth
    Avenues, is one of the pleasantest localities in New York. The
    gardens back of the houses, running down nearly to the Hudson,
    form, in the summer time, a perfect avenue of verdure. The air
    is pure and invigorating, sweeping, as it does, straight across
    the river from the Weehawken heights, and even the ragged
    garden which surrounded the house, although displaying on
    washing days rather too much clothesline, still gave us a piece
    of greensward to look at, and a cool retreat in the summer
    evenings, where we smoked our cigars in the dusk, and watched
    the fireflies flashing their dark lanterns in the long
    grass.

 Of course we had no sooner established ourselves at No.
    —— than we began to expect ghosts. We absolutely
    awaited their advent with eagerness. Our dinner conversation
    was supernatural. One of the boarders, who had purchased Mrs.
    Crowe's Night Side of Nature

for his own private
    delectation, was regarded as a public enemy by the entire
    household for not having bought twenty copies. The man led a
    life of supreme wretchedness while he was reading this volume.
    A system of espionage was established, of which he was the
    victim. If he incautiously laid the book down for an instant
    and left the room, it was immediately seized and read aloud in
    secret places to a select few. I found myself a person of
    immense importance, it having leaked out that I was tolerably
    well versed in the history of supernaturalism, and had once
    written a story the foundation of which was a ghost. If a table
    or a wainscot panel happened to warp when we were assembled in
    the large drawing-room, there was an instant silence, and
    everyone was prepared for an immediate clanking of chains and a
    spectral form.

 After a month of psychological excitement, it was with the
    utmost dissatisfaction that we were forced to acknowledge that
    nothing in the remotest degree approaching the supernatural had
    manifested itself. Once the black butler asseverated that his
    candle had been blown out by some invisible agency while he was
    undressing himself for the night; but as I had more than once
    discovered this colored gentleman in a condition when one
    candle must have appeared to him like two, thought it possible
    that, by going a step further in his potations, he might have
    reversed this phenomenon, and seen no candle at all where he
    ought to have beheld one.

 Things were in this state when an accident took place so
    awful and inexplicable in its character that my reason fairly
    reels at the bare memory of the occurrence. It was the tenth of
    July. After dinner was over I repaired, with my friend Dr.
    Hammond, to the garden to smoke my evening pipe. Independent of
    certain mental sympathies which existed between the Doctor and
    myself, we were linked together by a vice. We both smoked
    opium. We knew each other's secret, and respected it. We
    enjoyed together that wonderful expansion of thought, that
    marvelous intensifying of the perceptive faculties, that
    boundless feeling of existence when we seem to have points of
    contact with the whole universe,—in short, that
    unimaginable spiritual bliss, which I would not surrender for a
    throne, and which I hope you, reader, will never—never
    taste.

 Those hours of opium happiness which the Doctor and I spent
    together in secret were regulated with a scientific accuracy.
    We did not blindly smoke the drug of paradise, and leave our
    dreams to chance. While smoking, we carefully steered our
    conversation through the brightest and calmest channels of
    thought. We talked of the East, and endeavored to recall the
    magical panorama of its glowing scenery. We criticized the most
    sensuous poets,—those who painted life ruddy with health,
    brimming with passion, happy in the possession of youth and
    strength and beauty. If we talked of Shakespeare's Tempest

, we lingered over Ariel, and avoided Caliban.
    Like the Guebers, we turned our faces to the East, and saw only
    the sunny side of the world.

 This skillful coloring of our train of thought produced in
    our subsequent visions a corresponding tone. The splendors of
    Arabian fairyland dyed our dreams. We paced the narrow strip of
    grass with the tread and port of kings. The song of the Rana arborea

, while he clung to the bark of the ragged
    plum-tree, sounded like the strains of divine musicians.
    Houses, walls, and streets melted like rain clouds, and vistas
    of unimaginable glory stretched away before us. It was a
    rapturous companionship. We enjoyed the vast delight more
    perfectly because, even in our most ecstatic moments, we were
    conscious of each other's presence. Our pleasures, while
    individual, were still twin, vibrating and moving in musical
    accord.

 On the evening in question, the tenth of July, the Doctor
    and myself drifted into an unusually metaphysical mood. We lit
    our large meerschaums, filled with fine Turkish tobacco, in the
    core of which burned a little black nut of opium, that, like
    the nut in the fairy tale, held within its narrow limits
    wonders beyond the reach of kings; we paced to and fro,
    conversing. A strange perversity dominated the currents of our
    thought. They would not

flow through the sun-lit
    channels into which we strove to divert them. For some
    unaccountable reason, they constantly diverged into dark and
    lonesome beds, where a continual gloom brooded. It was in vain
    that, after our old fashion, we flung ourselves on the shores
    of the East, and talked of its gay bazaars, of the splendors of
    the time of Haroun, of harems and golden palaces. Black afreets
    continually arose from the depths of our talk, and expanded,
    like the one the fisherman released from the copper vessel,
    until they blotted everything bright from our vision.
    Insensibly, we yielded to the occult force that swayed us, and
    indulged in gloomy speculation. We had talked some time upon
    the proneness of the human mind to mysticism, and the almost
    universal love of the terrible, when Hammond suddenly said to
    me. "What do you consider to be the greatest element of
    terror?"

 The question puzzled me. That many things were terrible, I
    knew. Stumbling over a corpse in the dark; beholding, as I once
    did, a woman floating down a deep and rapid river, with wildly
    lifted arms, and awful, upturned face, uttering, as she
    drifted, shrieks that rent one's heart while we, spectators,
    stood frozen at a window which overhung the river at a height
    of sixty feet, unable to make the slightest effort to save her,
    but dumbly watching her last supreme agony and her
    disappearance. A shattered wreck, with no life visible,
    encountered floating listlessly on the ocean, is a terrible
    object, for it suggests a huge terror, the proportions of which
    are veiled. But it now struck me, for the first time, that
    there must be one great and ruling embodiment of fear,—a
    King of Terrors, to which all others must succumb. What might
    it be? To what train of circumstances would it owe its
    existence?

 "I confess, Hammond," I replied to my friend, "I never
    considered the subject before. That there must be one Something
    more terrible than any other thing, I feel. I cannot attempt,
    however, even the most vague definition."

 "I am somewhat like you, Harry," he answered. "I feel my
    capacity to experience a terror greater than anything yet
    conceived by the human mind;—something combining in
    fearful and unnatural amalgamation hitherto supposed
    incompatible elements. The calling of the voices in Brockden
    Brown's novel of Wieland

is awful; so is the picture
    of the Dweller of the Threshold, in Bulwer's Zanoni

;
    but," he added, shaking his head gloomily, "there is something
    more horrible still than those."

 "Look here, Hammond," I rejoined, "let us drop this kind of
    talk, for Heaven's sake! We shall suffer for it, depend on
    it."

 "I don't know what's the matter with me to-night," he
    replied, "but my brain is running upon all sorts of weird and
    awful thoughts. I feel as if I could write a story like
    Hoffman, to-night, if I were only master of a literary
    style."

 "Well, if we are going to be Hoffmanesque in our talk, I'm
    off to bed. Opium and nightmares should never be brought
    together. How sultry it is! Good-night, Hammond."

 "Good-night, Harry. Pleasant dreams to you."

 "To you, gloomy wretch, afreets, ghouls, and
    enchanters."

 We parted, and each sought his respective chamber. I
    undressed quickly and got into bed, taking with me, according
    to my usual custom, a book, over which I generally read myself
    to sleep. I opened the volume as soon as I had laid my head
    upon the pillow, and instantly flung it to the other side of
    the room. It was Goudon's History of Monsters

,—a
    curious French work, which I had lately imported from Paris,
    but which, in the state of mind I had then reached, was
    anything but an agreeable companion. I resolved to go to sleep
    at once; so, turning down my gas until nothing but a little
    blue point of light glimmered on the top of the tube, I
    composed myself to rest.

 The room was in total darkness. The atom of gas that still
    remained alight did not illuminate a distance of three inches
    round the burner. I desperately drew my arm across my eyes, as
    if to shut out even the darkness, and tried to think of
    nothing. It was in vain. The confounded themes touched on by
    Hammond in the garden kept obtruding themselves on my brain. I
    battled against them. I erected ramparts of would-be blackness
    of intellect to keep them out. They still crowded upon me.
    While I was lying still as a corpse, hoping that by a perfect
    physical inaction I should hasten mental repose, an awful
    incident occurred. A Something dropped, as it seemed, from the
    ceiling, plumb upon my chest, and the next instant I felt two
    bony hands encircling my throat, endeavoring to choke me.

 I am no coward, and am possessed of considerable physical
    strength. The suddenness of the attack, instead of stunning me,
    strung every nerve to its highest tension. My body acted from
    instinct, before my brain had time to realize the terrors of my
    position. In an instant I wound two muscular arms around the
    creature, and squeezed it, with all the strength of despair,
    against my chest. In a few seconds the bony hands that had
    fastened on my throat loosened their hold, and I was free to
    breathe once more. Then commenced a struggle of awful
    intensity. Immersed in the most profound darkness, totally
    ignorant of the nature of the Thing by which I was so suddenly
    attacked, finding my grasp slipping every moment, by reason, it
    seemed to me, of the entire nakedness of my assailant, bitten
    with sharp teeth in the shoulder, neck, and chest, having every
    moment to protect my throat against a pair of sinewy, agile
    hands, which my utmost efforts could not confine,—these
    were a combination of circumstances to combat which required
    all the strength, skill, and courage that I possessed.

 At last, after a silent, deadly, exhausting struggle, I got
    my assailant under by a series of incredible efforts of
    strength. Once pinned, with my knee on what I made out to be
    its chest, I knew that I was victor. I rested for a moment to
    breathe. I heard the creature beneath me panting in the
    darkness, and felt the violent throbbing of a heart. It was
    apparently as exhausted as I was; that was one comfort. At this
    moment I remembered that I usually placed under my pillow,
    before going to bed, a large yellow silk pocket handkerchief. I
    felt for it instantly; it was there. In a few seconds more I
    had, after a fashion, pinioned the creature's arms.

 I now felt tolerably secure. There was nothing more to be
    done but to turn on the gas, and, having first seen what my
    midnight assailant was like, arouse the household. I will
    confess to being actuated by a certain pride in not giving the
    alarm before; I wished to make the capture alone and
    unaided.

 Never losing my hold for an instant, I slipped from the bed
    to the floor, dragging my captive with me. I had but a few
    steps to make to reach the gas-burner; these I made with the
    greatest caution, holding the creature in a grip like a vice.
    At last I got within arm's length of the tiny speck of blue
    light which told me where the gas-burner lay. Quick as
    lightning I released my grasp with one hand and let on the full
    flood of light. Then I turned to look at my captive.

 I cannot even attempt to give any definition of my
    sensations the instant after I turned on the gas. I suppose I
    must have shrieked with terror, for in less than a minute
    afterward my room was crowded with the inmates of the house. I
    shudder now as I think of that awful moment. I saw
    nothing

! Yes; I had one arm firmly clasped round a
    breathing, panting, corporeal shape, my other hand gripped with
    all its strength a throat as warm, as apparently fleshy, as my
    own; and yet, with this living substance in my grasp, with its
    body pressed against my own, and all in the bright glare of a
    large jet of gas, I absolutely beheld nothing! Not even an
    outline,—a vapor!

 I do not, even at this hour, realize the situation in which
    I found myself. I cannot recall the astounding incident
    thoroughly. Imagination in vain tries to compass the awful
    paradox.

 It breathed. I felt its warm breath upon my cheek. It
    struggled fiercely. It had hands. They clutched me. Its skin
    was smooth, like my own. There it lay, pressed close up against
    me, solid as stone,—and yet utterly invisible!

 I wonder that I did not faint or go mad on the instant. Some
    wonderful instinct must have sustained me; for, absolutely, in
    place of loosening my hold on the terrible Enigma, I seemed to
    gain an additional strength in my moment of horror, and
    tightened my grasp with such wonderful force that I felt the
    creature shivering with agony.

 Just then Hammond entered my room at the head of the
    household. As soon as he beheld my face—which, I suppose,
    must have been an awful sight to look at—he hastened
    forward, crying, "Great heaven, Harry! what has happened?"

 "Hammond! Hammond!" I cried, "come here. O, this is awful! I
    have been attacked in bed by something or other, which I have
    hold of; but I can't see it,—I can't see it!"

 Hammond, doubtless struck by the unfeigned horror expressed
    in my countenance, made one or two steps forward with an
    anxious yet puzzled expression. A very audible titter burst
    from the remainder of my visitors. This suppressed laughter
    made me furious. To laugh at a human being in my position! It
    was the worst species of cruelty. Now

, I can
    understand why the appearance of a man struggling violently, as
    it would seem, with an airy nothing, and calling for assistance
    against a vision, should have appeared ludicrous. Then

, so great was my rage against the mocking crowd
    that had I the power I would have stricken them dead where they
    stood.

 "Hammond! Hammond!" I cried again, despairingly, "for God's
    sake come to me. I can hold the—the thing but a short
    while longer. It is overpowering me. Help me! Help me!"

 "Harry," whispered Hammond, approaching me, "you have been
    smoking too much opium."

 "I swear to you, Hammond, that this is no vision," I
    answered, in the same low tone. "Don't you see how it shakes my
    whole frame with its struggles? If you don't believe me,
    convince yourself. Feel it,—touch it."

 Hammond advanced and laid his hand in the spot I indicated.
    A wild cry of horror burst from him. He had felt it!

 In a moment he had discovered somewhere in my room a long
    piece of cord, and was the next instant winding it and knotting
    it about the body of the unseen being that I clasped in my
    arms.

 "Harry," he said, in a hoarse, agitated voice, for, though
    he preserved his presence of mind, he was deeply moved, "Harry,
    it's all safe now. You may let go, old fellow, if you're tired.
    The Thing can't move."

 I was utterly exhausted, and I gladly loosed my hold.

 Hammond stood holding the ends of the cord that bound the
    Invisible, twisted round his hand, while before him,
    self-supporting as it were, he beheld a rope laced and
    interlaced, and stretching tightly around a vacant space. I
    never saw a man look so thoroughly stricken with awe.
    Nevertheless his face expressed all the courage and
    determination which I knew him to possess. His lips, although
    white, were set firmly, and one could perceive at a glance
    that, although stricken with fear, he was not daunted.

 The confusion that ensued among the guests of the house who
    were witnesses of this extraordinary scene between Hammond and
    myself,—who beheld the pantomime of binding this
    struggling Something,—who beheld me almost sinking from
    physical exhaustion when my task of jailer was over,—the
    confusion and terror that took possession of the bystanders,
    when they saw all this, was beyond description. The weaker ones
    fled from the apartment. The few who remained clustered near
    the door and could not be induced to approach Hammond and his
    Charge. Still incredulity broke out through their terror. They
    had not the courage to satisfy themselves, and yet they
    doubted. It was in vain that I begged of some of the men to
    come near and convince themselves by touch of the existence in
    that room of a living being which was invisible. They were
    incredulous, but did not dare to undeceive themselves. How
    could a solid, living, breathing body be invisible, they asked.
    My reply was this. I gave a sign to Hammond, and both of
    us—conquering our fearful repugnance to touch the
    invisible creature—lifted it from the ground, manacled as
    it was, and took it to my bed. Its weight was about that of a
    boy of fourteen.

 "Now my friends," I said, as Hammond and myself held the
    creature suspended over the bed, "I can give you self-evident
    proof that here is a solid, ponderable body, which,
    nevertheless, you cannot see. Be good enough to watch the
    surface of the bed attentively."

 I was astonished at my own courage in treating this strange
    event so calmly; but I had recovered from my first terror, and
    felt a sort of scientific pride in the affair, which dominated
    every other feeling.

 The eyes of the bystanders were immediately fixed on my bed.
    At a given signal Hammond and I let the creature fall. There
    was a dull sound of a heavy body alighting on a soft mass. The
    timbers of the bed creaked. A deep impression marked itself
    distinctly on the pillow, and on the bed itself. The crowd who
    witnessed this gave a low cry, and rushed from the room.
    Hammond and I were left alone with our Mystery.

 We remained silent for some time, listening to the low,
    irregular breathing of the creature on the bed, and watching
    the rustle of the bedclothes as it impotently struggled to free
    itself from confinement. Then Hammond spoke.

 "Harry, this is awful."

 "Ay, awful."

 "But not unaccountable."

 "Not unaccountable! What do you mean? Such a thing has never
    occurred since the birth of the world. I know not what to
    think, Hammond. God grant that I am not mad, and that this is
    not an insane fantasy!"

 "Let us reason a little, Harry. Here is a solid body which
    we touch, but which we cannot see. The fact is so unusual that
    it strikes us with terror. Is there no parallel, though, for
    such a phenomenon? Take a piece of pure glass. It is tangible
    and transparent. A certain chemical coarseness is all that
    prevents its being so entirely transparent as to be totally
    invisible. It is not theoretically impossible

, mind
    you, to make a glass which shall not reflect a single ray of
    light,—a glass so pure and homogeneous in its atoms that
    the rays from the sun will pass through it as they do through
    the air, refracted but not reflected. We do not see the air,
    and yet we feel it."

 "That's all very well, Hammond, but these are inanimate
    substances. Glass does not breathe, air does not breathe. This

thing has a heart that palpitates,—a will
    that moves it,—lungs that play, and inspire and
    respire."

 "You forget the phenomena of which we have so often heard of
    late," answered the Doctor, gravely. "At the meetings called
    'spirit circles,' invisible hands have been thrust into the
    hands of those persons round the table,—warm, fleshly
    hands that seemed to pulsate with mortal life."

 "What? Do you think, then, that this thing
    is——"

 "I don't know what it is," was the solemn reply; "but please
    the gods I will, with your assistance, thoroughly investigate
    it."

 We watched together, smoking many pipes, all night long, by
    the bedside of the unearthly being that tossed and panted until
    it was apparently wearied out. Then we learned by the low,
    regular breathing that it slept.

 The next morning the house was all astir. The boarders
    congregated on the landing outside my room, and Hammond and
    myself were lions. We had to answer a thousand questions as to
    the state of our extraordinary prisoner, for as yet not one
    person in the house except ourselves could be induced to set
    foot in the apartment.

 The creature was awake. This was evidenced by the convulsive
    manner in which the bedclothes were moved in its efforts to
    escape. There was something truly terrible in beholding, as it
    were, those second-hand indications of the terrible writhings
    and agonized struggles for liberty which themselves were
    invisible.

 Hammond and myself had racked our brains during the long
    night to discover some means by which we might realize the
    shape and general appearance of the Enigma. As well as we could
    make out by passing our hands over the creature's form, its
    outlines and lineaments were human. There was a mouth; a round,
    smooth head without hair; a nose, which, however, was little
    elevated above the cheeks; and its hands and feet felt like
    those of a boy. At first we thought of placing the being on a
    smooth surface and tracing its outlines with chalk, as
    shoemakers trace the outline of the foot. This plan was given
    up as being of no value. Such an outline would give not the
    slightest idea of its conformation.

 A happy thought struck me. We would take a cast of it in
    plaster of Paris. This would give us the solid figure, and
    satisfy all our wishes. But how to do it? The movements of the
    creature would disturb the setting of the plastic covering, and
    distort the mold. Another thought. Why not give it chloroform?
    It had respiratory organs,—that was evident by its
    breathing. Once reduced to a state of insensibility, we could
    do with it what we would. Doctor X—— was sent for;
    and after the worthy physician had recovered from the first
    shock of amazement, he proceeded to administer the chloroform.
    In three minutes afterward we were enabled to remove the
    fetters from the creature's body, and a modeler was busily
    engaged in covering the invisible form with the moist clay. In
    five minutes more we had a mold, and before evening a rough
    facsimile of the Mystery. It was shaped like a
    man—distorted, uncouth, and horrible, but still a man. It
    was small, not over four feet and some inches in height, and
    its limbs revealed a muscular development that was
    unparalleled. Its face surpassed in hideousness anything I had
    ever seen. Gustav Doré, or Callot, or Tony Johannot,
    never conceived anything so horrible. There is a face in one of
    the latter's illustrations to Un Voyage où il vous
    plaira

, which somewhat approaches the countenance of this
    creature, but does not equal it. It was the physiognomy of what
    I should fancy a ghoul might be. It looked as if it was capable
    of feeding on human flesh.

 Having satisfied our curiosity, and bound every one in the
    house to secrecy, it became a question what was to be done with
    our Enigma? It was impossible that we should keep such a horror
    in our house; it was equally impossible that such an awful
    being should be let loose upon the world. I confess that I
    would have gladly voted for the creature's destruction. But who
    would shoulder the responsibility? Who would undertake the
    execution of this horrible semblance of a human being? Day
    after day this question was deliberated gravely. The boarders
    all left the house. Mrs. Moffat was in despair, and threatened
    Hammond and myself with all sorts of legal penalties if we did
    not remove the Horror. Our answer was, "We will go if you like,
    but we decline taking this creature with us. Remove it yourself
    if you please. It appeared in your house. On you the
    responsibility rests." To this there was, of course, no answer.
    Mrs. Moffat could not obtain for love or money a person who
    would even approach the Mystery.

 The most singular part of the affair was that we were
    entirely ignorant of what the creature habitually fed on.
    Everything in the way of nutriment that we could think of was
    placed before it, but was never touched. It was awful to stand
    by, day after day, and see the clothes toss, and hear the hard
    breathing, and know that it was starving.

 Ten, twelve days, a fortnight passed, and it still lived.
    The pulsations of the heart, however, were daily growing
    fainter, and had now nearly ceased. It was evident that the
    creature was dying for want of sustenance. While this terrible
    life-struggle was going on, I felt miserable. I could not
    sleep. Horrible as the creature was, it was pitiful to think of
    the pangs it was suffering.

 At last it died. Hammond and I found it cold and stiff one
    morning in the bed. The heart had ceased to beat, the lungs to
    inspire. We hastened to bury it in the garden. It was a strange
    funeral, the dropping of that viewless corpse into the damp
    hole. The cast of its form I gave to Doctor X——,
    who keeps it in his museum in Tenth Street.

 As I am on the eve of a long journey from which I may not
    return, I have drawn up this narrative of an event the most
    singular that has ever come to my knowledge.
