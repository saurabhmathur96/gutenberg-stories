THE BUMBLEBEAVER  BY KENYON COX

  A cheerful and industrious beast, 

 He's always humming as he goes 

 To make mud-houses with his tail 

 Or gather honey with his nose. 



 Although he flits from flower to flower 

 He's not at all a gay deceiver. 

 We might take lessons by the hour 

 From busy, buzzy Bumblebeaver.
