THE SOCIETY UPON THE STANISLAUS

 BY BRET HARTE

  I reside at Table Mountain, and my name is Truthful James; 

 I am not up to small deceit, or any sinful games; 

 And I'll tell in simple language what I know about the row 

 That broke up our society upon the Stanislow. 



 But first I would remark, that it is not a proper plan 

 For any scientific man to whale his fellow-man, 

 And, if a member don't agree with his peculiar whim, 

 To lay for that same member for to "put a head" on him. 



 Now, nothing could be finer or more beautiful to see 

 Than the first six months' proceedings of that same society, 

 Till Brown of Calaveras brought a lot of fossil bones 

 That he found within a tunnel near the tenement of Jones. 



 Then Brown he read a paper, and he reconstructed there, 

 From those same bones, an animal that was extremely rare; 

 And Jones then asked the Chair for a suspension of the rules, 

 Till he could prove that those same bones was one of his lost mules.





 Then Brown he smiled a bitter smile and said he was at fault, 

 It seemed he had been trespassing on Jones's family vault; 

 He was a most sarcastic man, this quiet Mr. Brown, 

 And on several occasions he had cleaned out the town. 



 Now, I hold it is not decent for a scientific gent 

 To say another is an ass—at least, to all intent; 

 Nor should the individual who happens to be meant 

 Reply by heaving rocks at him to any great extent. 



 Then Abner Dean of Angel's raised a point of order, when 

 A chunk of old red sandstone took him in the abdomen, 

 And he smiled a kind of sickly smile, and curled up on the floor, 

 And the subsequent proceedings interested him no more. 



 For, in less time than I write it, every member did engage 

 In a warfare with the remnants of a palæozoic age; 

 And the way they heaved those fossils in their anger was a sin, 

 Till the skull of an old mammoth caved the head of Thompson in. 



 And this is all I have to say of these improper games, 

 For I live at Table Mountain, and my name is Truthful James; 

 And I've told, in simple language, what I know about the row 

 That broke up our society upon the Stanislow.
