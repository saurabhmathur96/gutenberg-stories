THE FEAST OF THE MONKEYS

 BY JOHN PHILIP SOUSA

  In days of old, 

 So I've been told, 

 The monkeys gave a feast. 

 They sent out cards, 

 With kind regards, 

 To every bird and beast. 

 The guests came dressed, 

 In fashion's best, 

 Unmindful of expense; 

 Except the whale, 

 Whose swallowtail, 

 Was "soaked" for fifty cents. 



 The guests checked wraps, 

 Canes, hats and caps; 

 And when that task was done, 

 The footman he 

 With dignitee, 

 Announced them one by one. 

 In Monkey Hall, 

 The host met all, 

 And hoped they'd feel at ease, 

 "I scarcely can," 

 Said the Black and Tan, 

 "I'm busy hunting fleas."





 "While waiting for 

 A score or more 

 Of guests," the hostess said, 

 "We'll have the Poodle 

 Sing Yankee Doodle , 

 A-standing on his head. 

 And when this through, 

 Good Parrot, you, 

 Please show them how you swear." 

 "Oh, dear; don't cuss," 

 Cried the Octopus, 

 And he walked off on his ear. 



 The Orang-Outang 

 A sea-song sang, 

 About a Chimpanzee 

 Who went abroad, 

 In a drinking gourd, 

 To the coast of Barberee. 

 Where he heard one night, 

 When the moon shone bright, 

 A school of mermaids pick 

 Chromatic scales 

 From off their tails, 

 And did it mighty slick. 



 "All guests are here, 

 To eat the cheer, 

 And dinner's served, my Lord." 

 The butler bowed; 

 And then the crowd 

 Rushed in with one accord. 

 The fiddler-crab 

 Came in a cab,



 And played a piece in C; 

 While on his horn, 

 The Unicorn 

 Blew, You'll Remember Me . 



 "To give a touch 

 Of early Dutch 

 To this great feast of feasts, 

 I'll drink ten drops 

 Of Holland's schnapps," 

 Spoke out the King of Beasts. 

 "That must taste fine," 

 Said the Porcupine, 

 "Did you see him smack his lip?" 

 "I'd smack mine, too," 

 Cried the Kangaroo, 

 "If I didn't have the pip." 



 The Lion stood, 

 And said: "Be good 

 Enough to look this way; 

 Court Etiquette 

 Do not forget, 

 And mark well what I say: 

 My royal wish 

 Is ev'ry dish 

 Be tasted first by me." 

 "Here's where I smile," 

 Said the Crocodile, 

 And he climbed an axle-tree. 



 The soup was brought, 

 And quick as thought, 

 The Lion ate it all.



 "You can't beat that," 

 Exclaimed the Cat, 

 "For monumental gall." 

 "The soup," all cried. 

 "Gone," Leo replied, 

 "'Twas just a bit too thick." 

 "When we get through," 

 Remarked the Gnu, 

 "I'll hit him with a brick." 



 The Tiger stepped, 

 Or, rather, crept, 

 Up where the Lion sat. 

 "O, mighty boss 

 I'm at a loss 

 To know where I am at. 

 I came to-night 

 With appetite 

 To drink and also eat; 

 As a Tiger grand, 

 I now demand, 

 I get there with both feet." 



 The Lion got 

 All-fired hot 

 And in a passion flew. 

 "Get out," he cried, 

 "And save your hide, 

 You most offensive You ." 

 "I'm not afraid," 

 The Tiger said, 

 "I know what I'm about." 

 But the Lion's paw 

 Reached the Tiger's jaw, 

 And he was good and out.





 The salt-sea smell 

 Of Mackerel, 

 Upon the air arose; 

 Each hungry guest 

 Great joy expressed, 

 And "sniff!" went every nose. 

 With glutton look 

 The Lion took 

 The spiced and sav'ry dish. 

 Without a pause 

 He worked his jaws, 

 And gobbled all the fish. 



 Then ate the roast, 

 The quail on toast, 

 The pork, both fat and lean; 

 The jam and lamb, 

 The potted ham, 

 And drank the kerosene. 

 He raised his voice: 

 "Come, all rejoice, 

 You've seen your monarch dine." 

 "Never again," 

 Clucked the Hen, 

 And all sang Old Lang Syne .
