CROISILLES By Alfred De Musset
    

      I
    

      At the beginning of the reign of Louis XV., a young man named Croisilles,
      son of a goldsmith, was returning from Paris to Havre, his native town. He
      had been intrusted by his father with the transaction of some business,
      and his trip to the great city having turned out satisfactorily, the joy
      of bringing good news caused him to walk the sixty leagues more gaily and
      briskly than was his wont; for, though he had a rather large sum of money
      in his pocket, he travelled on foot for pleasure. He was a good-tempered
      fellow, and not without wit, but so very thoughtless and flighty that
      people looked upon him as being rather weak-minded. His doublet buttoned
      awry, his periwig flying to the wind, his hat under his arm, he followed
      the banks of the Seine, at times finding enjoyment in his own thoughts and
      again indulging in snatches of song; up at daybreak, supping at wayside
      inns, and always charmed with this stroll of his through one of the most
      beautiful regions of France. Plundering the apple-trees of Normandy on his
      way, he puzzled his brain to find rhymes (for all these rattlepates are
      more or less poets), and tried hard to turn out a madrigal for a certain
      fair damsel of his native place. She was no less than a daughter of a
      fermier-gÃ©nÃ©ral, Mademoiselle Godeau, the pearl of Havre, a rich heiress,
      and much courted. Croisilles was not received at M. Godeau’s
      otherwise than in a casual sort of way, that is to say, he had sometimes
      himself taken there articles of jewelry purchased at his father’s.
      M. Godeau, whose somewhat vulgar surname ill-fitted his immense fortune,
      avenged himself by his arrogance for the stigma of his birth, and showed
      himself on all occasions enormously and pitilessly rich. He certainly was
      not the man to allow the son of a goldsmith to enter his drawing-room;
      but, as Mademoiselle Godeau had the most beautiful eyes in the world, and
      Croisilles was not ill-favored, and as nothing can prevent a fine fellow
      from falling in love with a pretty girl, Croisilles adored Mademoiselle
      Godeau, who did not seem vexed thereat. Thus was he thinking of her as he
      turned his steps toward Havre; and, as he had never reflected seriously
      upon anything, instead of thinking of the invincible obstacles which
      separated him from his lady-love, he busied himself only with finding a
      rhyme for the Christian name she bore. Mademoiselle Godeau was called
      Julie, and the rhyme was found easily enough. So Croisilles, having
      reached Honfleur, embarked with a satisfied heart, his money and his
      madrigal in his pocket, and as soon as he jumped ashore ran to the
      paternal house.
    

      He found the shop closed, and knocked again and again, not without
      astonishment and apprehension, for it was not a holiday; but nobody came.
      He called his father, but in vain. He went to a neighbor’s to ask
      what had happened; instead of replying, the neighbor turned away, as
      though not wishing to recognize him. Croisilles repeated his questions; he
      learned that his father, his affairs having long been in an embarrassed
      condition, had just become bankrupt, and had fled to America, abandoning
      to his creditors all that he possessed.
    

      Not realizing as yet the extent of his misfortune, Croisilles felt
      overwhelmed by the thought that he might never again see his father. It
      seemed to him incredible that he should be thus suddenly abandoned; he
      tried to force an entrance into the store; but was given to understand
      that the official seals had been affixed; so he sat down on a stone, and
      giving way to his grief, began to weep piteously, deaf to the consolations
      of those around him, never ceasing to call his father’s name, though
      he knew him to be already far away. At last he rose, ashamed at seeing a
      crowd about him, and, in the most profound despair, turned his steps
      towards the harbor.
    

      On reaching the pier, he walked straight before him like a man in a
      trance, who knows neither where he is going nor what is to become of him.
      He saw himself irretrievably lost, possessing no longer a shelter, no
      means of rescue and, of course, no longer any friends. Alone, wandering on
      the sea-shore, he felt tempted to drown himself, then and there. Just at
      the moment when, yielding to this thought, he was advancing to the edge of
      a high cliff, an old servant named Jean, who had served his family for a
      number of years, arrived on the scene.
    

      “Ah! my poor Jean!” he exclaimed, “you know all that has
      happened since I went away. Is it possible that my father could leave us
      without warning, without farewell?”
    

      “He is gone,” answered Jean, “but indeed not without
      saying good-bye to you.”
    

      At the same time he drew from his pocket a letter, which he gave to his
      young master. Croisilles recognized the handwriting of his father, and,
      before opening the letter, kissed it rapturously; but it contained only a
      few words. Instead of feeling his trouble softened, it seemed to the young
      man still harder to bear. Honorable until then, and known as such, the old
      gentleman, ruined by an unforeseen disaster (the bankruptcy of a partner),
      had left for his son nothing but a few commonplace words of consolation,
      and no hope, except, perhaps, that vague hope without aim or reason which
      constitutes, it is said, the last possession one loses.
    

      “Jean, my friend, you carried me in your arms,” said
      Croisilles, when he had read the letter, “and you certainly are
      to-day the only being who loves me at all; it is a very sweet thing to me,
      but a very sad one for you; for, as sure as my father embarked there, I
      will throw myself into the same sea which is bearing him away; not before
      you nor at once, but some day I will do it, for I am lost.”
    

      “What can you do?” replied Jean, not seeming to have
      understood, but holding fast to the skirt of Croisilles’ coat;
      “What can you do, my dear master? Your father was deceived; he was
      expecting money which did not come, and it was no small amount either.
      Could he stay here? I have seen him, sir, as he made his fortune, during
      the thirty years that I served him. I have seen him working, attending to
      his business, the crown-pieces coming in one by one. He was an honorable
      man, and skilful; they took a cruel advantage of him. Within the last few
      days, I was still there, and as fast as the crowns came in, I saw them go
      out of the shop again. Your father paid all he could, for a whole day,
      and, when his desk was empty, he could not help telling me, pointing to a
      drawer where but six francs remained: ‘There were a hundred thousand
      francs there this morning!’ That does not look like a rascally
      failure, sir? There is nothing in it that can dishonor you.”
    

      “I have no more doubt of my father’s integrity,”
      answered Croisilles, “than I have of his misfortune. Neither do I
      doubt his affection. But I wish I could have kissed him, for what is to
      become of me? I am not accustomed to poverty, I have not the necessary
      cleverness to build up my fortune. And, if I had it, my father is gone. It
      took him thirty years, how long would it take me to repair this disaster?
      Much longer. And will he be living then? Certainly not; he will die over
      there, and I cannot even go and find him; I can join him only by dying.”
    

      Utterly distressed as Croisilles was, he possessed much religious feeling.
      Although his despondency made him wish for death, he hesitated to take his
      life. At the first words of this interview, he had taken hold of old Jean’s
      arm, and thus both returned to the town. When they had entered the streets
      and the sea was no longer so near:
    

      “It seems to me, sir,” said Jean, “that a good man has a
      right to live and that a misfortune proves nothing. Since your father has
      not killed himself, thank God, how can you think of dying? Since there is
      no dishonor in his case, and all the town knows it is so, what would they
      think of you? That you felt unable to endure poverty. It would be neither
      brave nor Christian; for, at the very worst, what is there to frighten
      you? There are plenty of people born poor, and who have never had either
      mother or father to help them on. I know that we are not all alike, but,
      after all, nothing is impossible to God. What would you do in such a case?
      Your father was not born rich, far from it,—meaning no offence—and
      that is perhaps what consoles him now. If you had been here, this last
      month, it would have given you courage. Yes, sir, a man may be ruined,
      nobody is secure from bankruptcy; but your father, I make bold to say, has
      borne himself through it all like a man, though he did leave us so
      hastily. But what could he do? It is not every day that a vessel starts
      for America. I accompanied him to the wharf, and if you had seen how sad
      he was! How he charged me to take care of you; to send him news from you!—Sir,
      it is a right poor idea you have, that throwing the helve after the
      hatchet. Every one has his time of trial in this world, and I was a
      soldier before I was a servant. I suffered severely at the time, but I was
      young; I was of your age, sir, and it seemed to me that Providence could
      not have spoken His last word to a young man of twenty-five. Why do you
      wish to prevent the kind God from repairing the evil that has befallen
      you? Give Him time, and all will come right. If I might advise you, I
      would say, just wait two or three years, and I will answer for it, you
      will come out all right. It is always easy to go out of this world. Why
      will you seize an unlucky moment?”
    

      While Jean was thus exerting himself to persuade his master, the latter
      walked in silence, and, as those who suffer often do, was looking this way
      and that as though seeking for something which might bind him to life. As
      chance would have it, at this juncture, Mademoiselle Godeau, the daughter
      of the fermier-gÃ©nÃ©ral, happened to pass with her governess. The mansion
      in which she lived was not far distant; Croisilles saw her enter it. This
      meeting produced on him more effect than all the reasonings in the world.
      I have said that he was rather erratic, and nearly always yielded to the
      first impulse. Without hesitating an instant, and without explanation, he
      suddenly left the arm of his old servant, and crossing the street, knocked
      at Monsieur Godeau’s door.
    

      II
    

      When we try to picture to ourselves, nowadays, what was called a “financier”
      in times gone by, we invariably imagine enormous corpulence, short legs, a
      gigantic wig, and a broad face with a triple chin,—and it is not
      without reason that we have become accustomed to form such a picture of
      such a personage. Everyone knows to what great abuses the royal
      tax-farming led, and it seems as though there were a law of nature which
      renders fatter than the rest of mankind those who fatten, not only upon
      their own laziness, but also upon the work of others.
    

      Monsieur Godeau, among financiers, was one of the most classical to be
      found,—that is to say, one of the fattest. At the present time he
      had the gout, which was nearly as fashionable in his day as the nervous
      headache is in ours. Stretched upon a lounge, his eyes half-closed, he was
      coddling himself in the coziest corner of a dainty boudoir. The
      panel-mirrors which surrounded him, majestically duplicated on every side
      his enormous person; bags filled with gold covered the table; around him,
      the furniture, the wainscot, the doors, the locks, the mantel-piece, the
      ceiling were gilded; so was his coat. I do not know but that his brain was
      gilded too. He was calculating the issue of a little business affair which
      could not fail to bring him a few thousand louis; and was even deigning to
      smile over it to himself when Croisilles was announced. The young man
      entered with an humble, but resolute air, and with every outward
      manifestation of that inward tumult with which we find no difficulty in
      crediting a man who is longing to drown himself. Monsieur Godeau was a
      little surprised at this unexpected visit; then he thought his daughter
      had been buying some trifle, and was confirmed in that thought by seeing
      her appear almost at the same time with the young man. He made a sign to
      Croisilles not to sit down but to speak. The young lady seated herself on
      a sofa, and Croisilles, remaining standing, expressed himself in these
      terms:
    

      “Sir, my father has failed. The bankruptcy of a partner has forced
      him to suspend his payments and unable to witness his own shame he has
      fled to America, after having paid his last sou to his creditors. I was
      absent when all this happened; I have just come back and have known of
      these events only two hours. I am absolutely without resources, and
      determined to die. It is very probable that, on leaving your house, I
      shall throw myself into the water. In all probability, I would already
      have done so, if I had not chanced to meet, at the very moment, this young
      lady, your daughter. I love her, from the very depths of my heart; for two
      years I have been in love with her, and my silence, until now, proves
      better than anything else the respect I feel for her; but to-day, in
      declaring my passion to you, I fulfill an imperative duty, and I would
      think I was offending God, if, before giving myself over to death, I did
      not come to ask you Mademoiselle Julie in marriage. I have not the
      slightest hope that you will grant this request; but I have to make it,
      nevertheless, for I am a good Christian, sir, and when a good Christian
      sees himself come to such a point of misery that he can no longer suffer
      life, he must at least, to extenuate his crime, exhaust all the chances
      which remain to him before taking the final and fatal step.”
    

      At the beginning of this speech, Monsieur Godeau had supposed that the
      young man came to borrow money, and so he prudently threw his handkerchief
      over the bags that were lying around him, preparing in advance a refusal,
      and a polite one, for he always felt some good-will toward the father of
      Croisilles. But when he had heard the young man to the end, and understood
      the purport of his visit, he never doubted one moment that the poor fellow
      had gone completely mad. He was at first tempted to ring the bell and have
      him put out; but, noticing his firm demeanor, his determined look, the
      fermier-gÃ©nÃ©ral took pity on so inoffensive a case of insanity. He merely
      told his daughter to retire, so that she might be no longer exposed to
      hearing such improprieties.
    

      While Croisilles was speaking, Mademoiselle Godeau had blushed as a peach
      in the month of August. At her father’s bidding, she retired, the
      young man making her a profound bow, which she did not seem to notice.
      Left alone with Croisilles, Monsieur Godeau coughed, rose, then dropped
      again upon the cushions, and, trying to assume a paternal air, delivered
      himself to the following effect:
    

      “My boy,” said he, “I am willing to believe that you are
      not poking fun at me, but you have really lost your head. I not only
      excuse this proceeding, but I consent not to punish you for it. I am sorry
      that your poor devil of a father has become bankrupt and has skipped. It
      is indeed very sad, and I quite understand that such a misfortune should
      affect your brain. Besides, I wish to do something for you; so take this
      stool and sit down there.”
    

      “It is useless, sir,” answered Croisilles. “If you
      refuse me, as I see you do, I have nothing left but to take my leave. I
      wish you every good fortune.”
    

      “And where are you going?”
    

      “To write to my father and say good-bye to him.”
    

      “Eh! the devil! Any one would swear you were speaking the truth. I’ll
      be damned if I don’t think you are going to drown yourself.”
    

      “Yes, sir; at least I think so, if my courage does not forsake me.”
    

      “That’s a bright idea! Fie on you! How can you be such a fool?
      Sit down, sir, I tell you, and listen to me.”
    

      Monsieur Godeau had just made a very wise reflection, which was that it is
      never agreeable to have it said that a man, whoever he may be, threw
      himself into the water on leaving your house. He therefore coughed once
      more, took his snuff-box, cast a careless glance upon his shirt-frill, and
      continued:
    

      “It is evident that you are nothing but a simpleton, a fool, a
      regular baby. You do not know what you are saying. You are ruined, that’s
      what has happened to you. But, my dear friend, all that is not enough; one
      must reflect upon the things of this world. If you came to ask me—well,
      good advice, for instance,—I might give it to you; but what is it
      you are after? You are in love with my daughter?”
    

      “Yes, sir, and I repeat to you, that I am far from supposing that
      you can give her to me in marriage; but as there is nothing in the world
      but that, which could prevent me from dying, if you believe in God, as I
      do not doubt you do, you will understand the reason that brings me here.”
    

      “Whether I believe in God or not, is no business of yours. I do not
      intend to be questioned. Answer me first: where have you seen my daughter?”
    

      “In my father’s shop, and in this house, when I brought
      jewelry for Mademoiselle Julie.”
    

      “Who told you her name was Julie? What are we coming to, great
      heavens! But be her name Julie or Javotte, do you know what is wanted in
      any one who aspires to the hand of the daughter of a fermier-gÃ©nÃ©ral?”
    

      “No, I am completely ignorant of it, unless it is to be as rich as
      she.”
    

      “Something more is necessary, my boy; you must have a name.”
    

      “Well! my name is Croisilles.”
    

      “Your name is Croisilles, poor wretch! Do you call that a name?”
    

      “Upon my soul and conscience, sir, it seems to me to be as good a
      name as Godeau.”
    

      “You are very impertinent, sir, and you shall rue it.”
    

      “Indeed, sir, do not be angry; I had not the least idea of offending
      you. If you see in what I said anything to wound you, and wish to punish
      me for it, there is no need to get angry. Have I not told you that on
      leaving here I am going straight to drown myself?”
    

      Although M. Godeau had promised himself to send Croisilles away as gently
      as possible, in order to avoid all scandal, his prudence could not resist
      the vexation of his wounded pride. The interview to which he had to resign
      himself was monstrous enough in itself; it may be imagined, then, what he
      felt at hearing himself spoken to in such terms.
    

      “Listen,” he said, almost beside himself, and determined to
      close the matter at any cost. “You are not such a fool that you
      cannot understand a word of common sense. Are you rich? No. Are you noble?
      Still less so. What is this frenzy that brings you here? You come to worry
      me; you think you are doing something clever; you know perfectly well that
      it is useless; you wish to make me responsible for your death. Have you
      any right to complain of me? Do I owe a son to your father? Is it my fault
      that you have come to this? Mon Dieu! When a man is going to drown
      himself, he keeps quiet about it—”
    

      “That is what I am going to do now. I am your very humble servant.”
    

      “One moment! It shall not be said that you had recourse to me in
      vain. There, my boy, here are three louis d’or: go and have dinner
      in the kitchen, and let me hear no more about you.”
    

      “Much obliged; I am not hungry, and I have no use for your money.”
    

      So Croisilles left the room, and the financier, having set his conscience
      at rest by the offer he had just made, settled himself more comfortably in
      his chair, and resumed his meditations.
    

      Mademoiselle Godeau, during this time, was not so far away as one might
      suppose; she had, it is true, withdrawn in obedience to her father; but,
      instead of going to her room, she had remained listening behind the door.
      If the extravagance of Croisilles seemed incredible to her, still she
      found nothing to offend her in it; for love, since the world has existed,
      has never passed as an insult. On the other hand, as it was not possible
      to doubt the despair of the young man, Mademoiselle Godeau found herself a
      victim, at one and the same time, to the two sentiments most dangerous to
      women—compassion and curiosity. When she saw the interview at an
      end, and Croisilles ready to come out, she rapidly crossed the
      drawing-room where she stood, not wishing to be surprised eavesdropping,
      and hurried towards her apartment; but she almost immediately retraced her
      steps. The idea that perhaps Croisilles was really going to put an end to
      his life troubled her in spite of herself. Scarcely aware of what she was
      doing, she walked to meet him; the drawing-room was large, and the two
      young people came slowly towards each other. Croisilles was as pale as
      death, and Mademoiselle Godeau vainly sought words to express her
      feelings. In passing beside him, she let fall on the floor a bunch of
      violets which she held in her hand. He at once bent down and picked up the
      bouquet in order to give it back to her, but instead of taking it, she
      passed on without uttering a word, and entered her father’s room.
      Croisilles, alone again, put the flowers in his breast, and left the house
      with a troubled heart, not knowing what to think of his adventure.
    

      III
    

      Scarcely had he taken a few steps in the street, when he saw his faithful
      friend Jean running towards him with a joyful face.
    

      “What has happened?” he asked; “have you news to tell
      me?”
    

      “Yes,” replied Jean; “I have to tell you that the seals
      have been officially broken and that you can enter your home. All your
      father’s debts being paid, you remain the owner of the house. It is
      true that all the money and all the jewels have been taken away; but at
      least the house belongs to you, and you have not lost everything. I have
      been running about for an hour, not knowing what had become of you, and I
      hope, my dear master, that you will now be wise enough to take a
      reasonable course.”
    

      “What course do you wish me to take?”
    

      “Sell this house, sir, it is all your fortune. It will bring you
      about thirty thousand francs. With that at any rate you will not die of
      hunger; and what is to prevent you from buying a little stock in trade,
      and starting business for yourself? You would surely prosper.”
    

      “We shall see about this,” answered Croisilles, as he hurried
      to the street where his home was. He was eager to see the paternal roof
      again. But when he arrived there so sad a spectacle met his gaze, that he
      had scarcely the courage to enter. The shop was in utter disorder, the
      rooms deserted, his father’s alcove empty. Everything presented to
      his eyes the wretchedness of utter ruin. Not a chair remained; all the
      drawers had been ransacked, the till broken open, the chest taken away;
      nothing had escaped the greedy search of creditors and lawyers; who, after
      having pillaged the house, had gone, leaving the doors open, as though to
      testify to all passers-by how neatly their work was done.
    

      “This, then,” exclaimed Croisilles, “is all that remains
      after thirty years of work and a respectable life,—and all through
      the failure to have ready, on a given day, money enough to honor a
      signature imprudently given!”
    

      While the young man walked up and down given over to the saddest thoughts,
      Jean seemed very much embarrassed. He supposed that his master was without
      ready money, and that he might perhaps not even have dined. He was
      therefore trying to think of some way to question him on the subject, and
      to offer him, in case of need, some part of his savings. After having
      tortured his mind for a quarter of an hour to try and hit upon some way of
      leading up to the subject, he could find nothing better than to come up to
      Croisilles, and ask him, in a kindly voice:
    

      “Sir, do you still like roast partridges?”
    

      The poor man uttered this question in a tone at once so comical and so
      touching, that Croisilles, in spite of his sadness, could not refrain from
      laughing.
    

      “And why do you ask me that?” said he.
    

      “My wife,” replied Jean, “is cooking me some for dinner,
      sir, and if by chance you still liked them—”
    

      Croisilles had completely forgotten till now the money which he was
      bringing back to his father. Jean’s proposal reminded him that his
      pockets were full of gold.
    

      “I thank you with all my heart,” said he to the old man,
      “and I accept your dinner with pleasure; but, if you are anxious
      about my fortune, be reassured. I have more money than I need to have a
      good supper this evening, which you, in your turn, will share with me.”
    

      Saying this, he laid upon the mantel four well-filled purses, which he
      emptied, each containing fifty louis.
    

      “Although this sum does not belong to me,” he added, “I
      can use it for a day or two. To whom must I go to have it forwarded to my
      father?”
    

      “Sir,” replied Jean, eagerly, “your father especially
      charged me to tell you that this money belongs to you, and, if I did not
      speak of it before, it was because I did not know how your affairs in
      Paris had turned out. Where he has gone your father will want for nothing;
      he will lodge with one of your correspondents, who will receive him most
      gladly; he has moreover taken with him enough for his immediate needs, for
      he was quite sure of still leaving behind more than was necessary to pay
      all his just debts. All that he has left, sir, is yours; he says so
      himself in his letter, and I am especially charged to repeat it to you.
      That gold is, therefore, legitimately your property, as this house in
      which we are now. I can repeat to you the very words your father said to
      me on embarking: âMay my son forgive me for leaving him; may he remember
      that I am still in the world only to love me, and let him use what remains
      after my debts are paid as though it were his inheritance.’ Those,
      sir, are his own expressions; so put this back in your pocket, and, since
      you accept my dinner, pray let us go home.”
    

      The honest joy which shone in Jean’s eyes, left no doubt in the mind
      of Croisilles. The words of his father had moved him to such a point that
      he could not restrain his tears; on the other hand, at such a moment, four
      thousand francs were no bagatelle. As to the house, it was not an
      available resource, for one could realize on it only by selling it, and
      that was both difficult and slow. All this, however, could not but make a
      considerable change in the situation the young man found himself in; so he
      felt suddenly moved—shaken in his dismal resolution, and, so to
      speak, both sad and, at the same time, relieved of much of his distress.
      After having closed the shutters of the shop, he left the house with Jean,
      and as he once more crossed the town, could not help thinking how small a
      thing our affections are, since they sometimes serve to make us find an
      unforeseen joy in the faintest ray of hope. It was with this thought that
      he sat down to dinner beside his old servant, who did not fail, during the
      repast, to make every effort to cheer him.
    

      Heedless people have a happy fault. They are easily cast down, but they
      have not even the trouble to console themselves, so changeable is their
      mind. It would be a mistake to think them, on that account, insensible or
      selfish; on the contrary they perhaps feel more keenly than others and are
      but too prone to blow their brains out in a moment of despair; but, this
      moment once passed, if they are still alive, they must dine, they must
      eat, they must drink, as usual; only to melt into tears again at bed-time.
      Joy and pain do not glide over them but pierce them through like arrows.
      Kind, hot-headed natures which know how to suffer, but not how to lie,
      through which one can clearly read,—not fragile and empty like
      glass, but solid and transparent like rock crystal.
    

      After having clinked glasses with Jean, Croisilles, instead of drowning
      himself, went to the play. Standing at the back of the pit, he drew from
      his bosom Mademoiselle Godeau’s bouquet, and, as he breathed the
      perfume in deep meditation, he began to think in a calmer spirit about his
      adventure of the morning. As soon as he had pondered over it for awhile,
      he saw clearly the truth; that is to say, that the young lady, in leaving
      the bouquet in his hands, and in refusing to take it back, had wished to
      give him a mark of interest; for otherwise this refusal and this silence
      could only have been marks of contempt, and such a supposition was not
      possible. Croisilles, therefore, judged that Mademoiselle Godeau’s
      heart was of a softer grain than her father’s and he remembered
      distinctly that the young lady’s face, when she crossed the
      drawing-room, had expressed an emotion the more true that it seemed
      involuntary. But was this emotion one of love, or only of sympathy? Or was
      it perhaps something of still less importance,—mere commonplace
      pity? Had Mademoiselle Godeau feared to see him die—him, Croisilles—or
      merely to be the cause of the death of a man, no matter what man? Although
      withered and almost leafless, the bouquet still retained so exquisite an
      odor and so brave a look, that in breathing it and looking at it,
      Croisilles could not help hoping. It was a thin garland of roses round a
      bunch of violets. What mysterious depths of sentiment an Oriental might
      have read in these flowers, by interpreting their language! But after all,
      he need not be an Oriental in this case. The flowers which fall from the
      breast of a pretty woman, in Europe, as in the East, are never mute; were
      they but to tell what they have seen while reposing in that lovely bosom,
      it would be enough for a lover, and this, in fact, they do. Perfumes have
      more than one resemblance to love, and there are even people who think
      love to be but a sort of perfume; it is true the flowers which exhale it
      are the most beautiful in creation.
    

      While Croisilles mused thus, paying very little attention to the tragedy
      that was being acted at the time, Mademoiselle Godeau herself appeared in
      a box opposite.
    

      The idea did not occur to the young man that, if she should notice him,
      she might think it very strange to find the would-be suicide there after
      what had transpired in the morning. He, on the contrary, bent all his
      efforts towards getting nearer to her; but he could not succeed. A
      fifth-rate actress from Paris had come to play MÃ©rope, and the crowd was
      so dense that one could not move. For lack of anything better, Croisilles
      had to content himself with fixing his gaze upon his lady-love, not
      lifting his eyes from her for a moment. He noticed that she seemed
      pre-occupied and moody, and that she spoke to every one with a sort of
      repugnance. Her box was surrounded, as may be imagined, by all the fops of
      the neighborhood, each of whom passed several times before her in the
      gallery, totally unable to enter the box, of which her father filled more
      than three-fourths. Croisilles noticed further that she was not using her
      opera-glasses, nor was she listening to the play. Her elbows resting on
      the balustrade, her chin in her hand, with her far-away look, she seemed,
      in all her sumptuous apparel, like some statue of Venus disguised en
      marquise. The display of her dress and her hair, her rouge, beneath which
      one could guess her paleness, all the splendor of her toilet, did but the
      more distinctly bring out the immobility of her countenance. Never had
      Croisilles seen her so beautiful. Having found means, between the acts, to
      escape from the crush, he hurried off to look at her from the passage
      leading to her box, and, strange to say, scarcely had he reached it, when
      Mademoiselle Godeau, who had not stirred for the last hour, turned round.
      She started slightly as she noticed him and only cast a glance at him;
      then she resumed her former attitude. Whether that glance expressed
      surprise, anxiety, pleasure or love; whether it meant “What, not
      dead!” or “God be praised! There you are, living!”—I
      do not pretend to explain. Be that as it may; at that glance, Croisilles
      inwardly swore to himself to die or gain her love.
    

      IV
    

      Of all the obstacles which hinder the smooth course of love, the greatest
      is, without doubt, what is called false shame, which is indeed a very
      potent obstacle.
    

      Croisilles was not troubled with this unhappy failing, which both pride
      and timidity combine to produce; he was not one of those who, for whole
      months, hover round the woman they love, like a cat round a caged bird. As
      soon as he had given up the idea of drowning himself, he thought only of
      letting his dear Julie know that he lived solely for her. But how could he
      tell her so? Should he present himself a second time at the mansion of the
      fermier-gÃ©nÃ©ral, it was but too certain that M. Godeau would have him
      ejected.
    

      Julie, when she happened to take a walk, never went without her maid; it
      was therefore useless to undertake to follow her. To pass the nights under
      the windows of one’s beloved is a folly dear to lovers, but, in the
      present case, it would certainly prove vain. I said before that Croisilles
      was very religious; it therefore never entered his mind to seek to meet
      his lady-love at church. As the best way, though the most dangerous, is to
      write to people when one cannot speak to them in person, he decided on the
      very next day to write to the young lady.
    

      His letter possessed, naturally, neither order nor reason. It read
      somewhat as follows:
    

      “Mademoiselle,—Tell me exactly, I beg of you, what fortune one
      must possess to be able to pretend to your hand. I am asking you a strange
      question; but I love you so desperately, that it is impossible for me not
      to ask it, and you are the only person in the world to whom I can address
      it. It seemed to me, last evening, that you looked at me at the play. I
      had wished to die; would to God I were indeed dead, if I am mistaken, and
      if that look was not meant for me. Tell me if Fate can be so cruel as to
      let a man deceive himself in a manner at once so sad and so sweet. I
      believe that you commanded me to live. You are rich, beautiful. I know it.
      Your father is arrogant and miserly, and you have a right to be proud; but
      I love you, and the rest is a dream. Fix your charming eyes on me; think
      of what love can do, when I who suffer so cruelly, who must stand in fear
      of every thing, feel, nevertheless, an inexpressible joy in writing you
      this mad letter, which will perhaps bring down your anger upon me. But
      think also, mademoiselle that you are a little to blame for this, my
      folly. Why did you drop that bouquet? Put yourself for an instant, if
      possible, in my place; I dare think that you love me, and I dare ask you
      to tell me so. Forgive me, I beseech you. I would give my life’s
      blood to be sure of not offending you, and to see you listening to my love
      with that angel smile which belongs only to you.
    

      “Whatever you may do, your image remains mine; you can remove it
      only by tearing out my heart. As long as your look lives in my
      remembrance, as long as the bouquet keeps a trace of its perfume, as long
      as a word will tell of love, I will cherish hope.”
    

      Having sealed his letter, Croisilles went out and walked up and down the
      street opposite the Godeau mansion, waiting for a servant to come out.
      Chance, which always serves mysterious loves, when it can do so without
      compromising itself, willed it that Mademoiselle Julie’s maid should
      have arranged to purchase a cap on that day. She was going to the milliner’s
      when Croisilles accosted her, slipped a louis into her hand, and asked her
      to take charge of his letter.
    

      The bargain was soon struck; the servant took the money to pay for her cap
      and promised to do the errand out of gratitude. Croisilles, full of joy,
      went home and sat at his door awaiting an answer.
    

      Before speaking of this answer, a word must be said about Mademoiselle
      Godeau. She was not quite free from the vanity of her father, but her good
      nature was ever uppermost. She was, in the full meaning of the term, a
      spoilt child. She habitually spoke very little, and never was she seen
      with a needle in her hand; she spent her days at her toilet, and her
      evenings on the sofa, not seeming to hear the conversation going on around
      her. As regards her dress, she was prodigiously coquettish, and her own
      face was surely what she thought most of on earth. A wrinkle in her
      collarette, an ink-spot on her finger, would have distressed her; and,
      when her dress pleased her, nothing can describe the last look which she
      cast at her mirror before leaving the room. She showed neither taste nor
      aversion for the pleasures in which young ladies usually delight. She went
      to balls willingly enough, and renounced going to them without a show of
      temper, sometimes without motive.
    

      The play wearied her, and she was in the constant habit of falling asleep
      there. When her father, who worshipped her, proposed to make her some
      present of her own choice, she took an hour to decide, not being able to
      think of anything she cared for. When M. Godeau gave a reception or a
      dinner, it often happened that Julie would not appear in the drawing-room,
      and at such times she passed the evening alone in her own room, in full
      dress, walking up and down, her fan in her hand. If a compliment was
      addressed to her, she turned away her head, and if any one attempted to
      pay court to her, she responded only by a look at once so dazzling and so
      serious as to disconcert even the boldest. Never had a sally made her
      laugh; never had an air in an opera, a flight of tragedy, moved her;
      indeed, never had her heart given a sign of life; and, on seeing her pass
      in all the splendor of her nonchalant loveliness one might have taken her
      for a beautiful somnambulist, walking through the world as in a trance.
    

      So much indifference and coquetry did not seem easy to understand. Some
      said she loved nothing, others that she loved nothing but herself. A
      single word, however, suffices to explain her character,—she was
      waiting. From the age of fourteen she had heard it ceaselessly repeated
      that nothing was so charming as she. She was convinced of this, and that
      was why she paid so much attention to dress. In failing to do honor to her
      own person, she would have thought herself guilty of sacrilege. She
      walked, in her beauty, so to speak, like a child in its holiday dress; but
      she was very far from thinking that her beauty was to remain useless.
    

      Beneath her apparent unconcern she had a will, secret, inflexible, and the
      more potent the better it was concealed. The coquetry of ordinary women,
      which spends itself in ogling, in simpering, and in smiling, seemed to her
      a childish, vain, almost contemptible way of fighting with shadows. She
      felt herself in possession of a treasure, and she disdained to stake it
      piece by piece; she needed an adversary worthy of herself; but, too
      accustomed to see her wishes anticipated, she did not seek that adversary;
      it may even be said that she felt astonished at his failing to present
      himself.
    

      For the four or five years that she had been out in society and had
      conscientiously displayed her flowers, her furbelows, and her beautiful
      shoulders, it seemed to her inconceivable that she had not yet inspired
      some great passion.
    

      Had she said what was really behind her thoughts, she certainly would have
      replied to her many flatterers: “Well! if it is true that I am so
      beautiful, why do you not blow your brains out for me?” An answer
      which many other young girls might make, and which more than one who says
      nothing hides away in a corner of her heart, not far perhaps from the tip
      of her tongue.
    

      What is there, indeed, in the world, more tantalizing for a woman than to
      be young, rich, beautiful, to look at herself in her mirror and see
      herself charmingly dressed, worthy in every way to please, fully disposed
      to allow herself to be loved, and to have to say to herself: “I am
      admired, I am praised, all the world thinks me charming, but nobody loves
      me. My gown is by the best maker, my laces are superb, my coiffure is
      irreproachable, my face the most beautiful on earth, my figure slender, my
      foot prettily turned, and all this helps me to nothing but to go and yawn
      in the corner of some drawing-room! If a young man speaks to me he treats
      me as a child; if I am asked in marriage, it is for my dowry; if somebody
      presses my hand in a dance, it is sure to be some provincial fop; as soon
      as I appear anywhere, I excite a murmur of admiration; but nobody speaks
      low, in my ear, a word that makes my heart beat. I hear impertinent men
      praising me in loud tones, a couple of feet away, and never a look of
      humbly sincere adoration meets mine. Still I have an ardent soul full of
      life, and I am not, by any means, only a pretty doll to be shown about, to
      be made to dance at a ball, to be dressed by a maid in the morning and
      undressed at night—beginning the whole thing over again the next
      day.”
    

      That is what Mademoiselle Godeau had many times said to herself; and there
      were hours when that thought inspired her with so gloomy a feeling that
      she remained mute and almost motionless for a whole day. When Croisilles
      wrote her, she was in just such a fit of ill-humor. She had just been
      taking her chocolate and was deep in meditation, stretched upon a lounge,
      when her maid entered and handed her the letter with a mysterious air. She
      looked at the address, and not recognizing the handwriting, fell again to
      musing.
    

      The maid then saw herself forced to explain what it was, which she did
      with a rather disconcerted air, not being at all sure how the young lady
      would take the matter. Mademoiselle Godeau listened without moving, then
      opened the letter, and cast only a glance at it; she at once asked for a
      sheet of paper, and nonchalantly wrote these few words:
    

      “No, sir, I assure you I am not proud. If you had only a hundred
      thousand crowns, I would willingly marry you.”
    

      Such was the reply which the maid at once took to Croisilles, who gave her
      another louis for her trouble.
    

      V
    

      A hundred thousand crowns are not found “in a donkey’s
      hoof-print,” and if Croisilles had been suspicious he might have
      thought in reading Mademoiselle Godeau’s letter that she was either
      crazy or laughing at him. He thought neither, for he only saw in it that
      his darling Julie loved him, and that he must have a hundred thousand
      crowns, and he dreamed from that moment of nothing but trying to secure
      them.
    

      He possessed two hundred louis in cash, plus a house which, as I have
      said, might be worth about thirty thousand francs. What was to be done?
      How was he to go about transfiguring these thirty-four thousand francs, at
      a jump, into three hundred thousand. The first idea which came into the
      mind of the young man was to find some way of staking his whole fortune on
      the toss-up of a coin, but for that he must sell the house. Croisilles
      therefore began by putting a notice upon the door, stating that his house
      was for sale; then, while dreaming what he would do with the money that he
      would get for it, he awaited a purchaser.
    

      A week went by, then another; not a single purchaser applied. More and
      more distressed, Croisilles spent these days with Jean, and despair was
      taking possession of him once more, when a Jewish broker rang at the door.
    

      “This house is for sale, sir, is it not? Are you the owner of it?”
    

      “Yes, sir.”
    

      “And how much is it worth?”
    

      “Thirty thousand francs, I believe; at least I have heard my father
      say so.”
    

      The Jew visited all the rooms, went upstairs and down into the cellar,
      knocking on the walls, counting the steps of the staircase, turning the
      doors on their hinges and the keys in their locks, opening and closing the
      windows; then, at last, after having thoroughly examined everything,
      without saying a word and without making the slightest proposal, he bowed
      to Croisilles and retired.
    

      Croisilles, who for a whole hour had followed him with a palpitating
      heart, as may be imagined, was not a little disappointed at this silent
      retreat. He thought that perhaps the Jew had wished to give himself time
      to reflect and that he would return presently. He waited a week for him,
      not daring to go out for fear of missing his visit, and looking out of the
      windows from morning till night. But it was in vain; the Jew did not
      reappear. Jean, true to his unpleasant rÃ´le of adviser, brought moral
      pressure to bear to dissuade his master from selling his house in so hasty
      a manner and for so extravagant a purpose. Dying of impatience, ennui, and
      love, Croisilles one morning took his two hundred louis and went out,
      determined to tempt fortune with this sum, since he could not have more.
    

      The gaming-houses at that time were not public, and that refinement of
      civilization which enables the first comer to ruin himself at all hours,
      as soon as the wish enters his mind, had not yet been invented.
    

      Scarcely was Croisilles in the street before he stopped, not knowing where
      to go to stake his money. He looked at the houses of the neighborhood, and
      eyed them, one after the other, striving to discover suspicious
      appearances that might point out to him the object of his search. A
      good-looking young man, splendidly dressed, happened to pass. Judging from
      his mien, he was certainly a young man of gentle blood and ample leisure,
      so Croisilles politely accosted him.
    

      “Sir,” he said, “I beg your pardon for the liberty I
      take. I have two hundred louis in my pocket and I am dying either to lose
      them or win more. Could you not point out to me some respectable place
      where such things are done?”
    

      At this rather strange speech the young man burst out laughing.
    

      “Upon my word, sir!” answered he, “if you are seeking
      any such wicked place you have but to follow me, for that is just where I
      am going.”
    

      Croisilles followed him, and a few steps farther they both entered a house
      of very attractive appearance, where they were received hospitably by an
      old gentleman of the highest breeding.
    

      Several young men were already seated round a green cloth. Croisilles
      modestly took a place there, and in less than an hour his two hundred
      louis were gone.
    

      He came out as sad as a lover can be who thinks himself beloved. He had
      not enough to dine with, but that did not cause him any anxiety.
    

      “What can I do now,” he asked himself, “to get money? To
      whom shall I address myself in this town? Who will lend me even a hundred
      louis on this house that I can not sell?”
    

      While he was in this quandary, he met his Jewish broker. He did not
      hesitate to address him, and, featherhead as he was, did not fail to tell
      him the plight he was in.
    

      The Jew did not much want to buy the house; he had come to see it only
      through curiosity, or, to speak more exactly, for the satisfaction of his
      own conscience, as a passing dog goes into a kitchen, the door of which
      stands open, to see if there is anything to steal. But when he saw
      Croisilles so despondent, so sad, so bereft of all resources, he could not
      resist the temptation to put himself to some inconvenience, even, in order
      to pay for the house. He therefore offered him about one-fourth of its
      value. Croisilles fell upon his neck, called him his friend and saviour,
      blindly signed a bargain that would have made one’s hair stand on
      end, and, on the very next day, the possessor of four hundred new louis,
      he once more turned his steps toward the gambling-house where he had been
      so politely and speedily ruined the night before.
    

      On his way, he passed by the wharf. A vessel was about leaving; the wind
      was gentle, the ocean tranquil. On all sides, merchants, sailors, officers
      in uniform were coming and going. Porters were carrying enormous bales of
      merchandise. Passengers and their friends were exchanging farewells, small
      boats were rowing about in all directions; on every face could be read
      fear, impatience, or hope; and, amidst all the agitation which surrounded
      it, the majestic vessel swayed gently to and fro under the wind that
      swelled her proud sails.
    

      “What a grand thing it is,” thought Croisilles, “to risk
      all one possesses and go beyond the sea, in perilous search of fortune!
      How it fills me with emotion to look at this vessel setting out on her
      voyage, loaded with so much wealth, with the welfare of so many families!
      What joy to see her come back again, bringing twice as much as was
      intrusted to her, returning so much prouder and richer than she went away!
      Why am I not one of those merchants? Why could I not stake my four hundred
      louis in this way? This immense sea! What a green cloth, on which to
      boldly tempt fortune! Why should I not myself buy a few bales of cloth or
      silk? What is to prevent my doing so, since I have gold? Why should this
      captain refuse to take charge of my merchandise? And who knows? Instead of
      going and throwing away this—my little all—in a
      gambling-house, I might double it, I might triple it, perhaps, by honest
      industry. If Julie truly loves me, she will wait a few years, she will
      remain true to me until I am able to marry her. Commerce sometimes yields
      greater profits than one thinks; examples are wanting in this world of
      wealth gained with astonishing rapidity in this way on the changing waves—why
      should Providence not bless an endeavor made for a purpose so laudable, so
      worthy of His assistance? Among these merchants who have accumulated so
      much and who send their vessels to the ends of the world, more than one
      has begun with a smaller sum than I have now. They have prospered with the
      help of God; why should I not prosper in my turn? It seems to me as though
      a good wind were filling these sails, and this vessel inspires confidence.
      Come! the die is cast; I will speak to the captain, who seems to be a good
      fellow; I will then write to Julie, and set out to become a clever and
      successful trader.”
    

      The greatest danger incurred by those who are habitually but half crazy,
      is that of becoming, at times, altogether so.
    

      The poor fellow, without further deliberation, put his whim into
      execution. To find goods to buy, when one has money and knows nothing
      about the goods, is the easiest thing in the world.
    

      The captain, to oblige Croisilles, took him to one of his friends, a
      manufacturer, who sold him as much cloth and silk as he could pay for. The
      whole of it, loaded upon a cart, was promptly taken on board. Croisilles,
      delighted and full of hope, had himself written in large letters his name
      upon the bales. He watched them being put on board with inexpressible joy;
      the hour of departure soon came, and the vessel weighed anchor.
    

      VI
    

      I need not say that in this transaction, Croisilles had kept no money in
      hand. His house was sold; and there remained to him, for his sole fortune,
      the clothes he had on his back;—no home, and not a son. With the
      best will possible, Jean could not suppose that his master was reduced to
      such an extremity; Croisilles was not too proud, but too thoughtless to
      tell him of it. So he determined to sleep under the starry vault, and as
      for his meals, he made the following calculation; he presumed that the
      vessel which bore his fortune would be six months before coming back to
      Havre; Croisilles, therefore, not without regret, sold a gold watch his
      father had given him, and which he had fortunately kept; he got thirty-six
      livres for it. That was sufficient to live on for about six months, at the
      rate of four sous a day. He did not doubt that it would be enough, and,
      reassured for the present, he wrote to Mademoiselle Godeau to inform her
      of what he had done. He was very careful in his letter not to speak of his
      distress; he announced to her, on the contrary, that he had undertaken a
      magnificent commercial enterprise, of the speedy and fortunate issue of
      which there could be no doubt; he explained to her that La Fleurette, a
      merchant-vessel of one hundred and fifty tons, was carrying to the Baltic
      his cloths and his silks, and implored her to remain faithful to him for a
      year, reserving to himself the right of asking, later on, for a further
      delay, while, for his part, he swore eternal love to her.
    

      When Mademoiselle Godeau received this letter she was sitting before the
      fire, and had in her hand, using it as a screen, one of those bulletins
      which are printed in seaports, announcing the arrival and departure of
      vessels, and which also report disasters at sea. It had never occurred to
      her, as one can well imagine, to take an interest in this sort of thing;
      she had in fact never glanced at any of these sheets.
    

      The perusal of Croisilles’ letter prompted her to read the bulletin
      she had been holding in her hand; the first word that caught her eye was
      no other than the name of La Fleurette.
    

      The vessel had been wrecked on the coast of France, on the very night
      following its departure. The crew had barely escaped, but all the cargo
      was lost.
    

      Mademoiselle Godeau, at this news, no longer remembered that Croisilles
      had made to her an avowal of his poverty; she was as heartbroken as though
      a million had been at stake.
    

      In an instant, the horrors of the tempest, the fury of the winds, the
      cries of the drowning, the ruin of the man who loved her, presented
      themselves to her mind like a scene in a romance. The bulletin and the
      letter fell from her hands. She rose in great agitation, and, with heaving
      breast and eyes brimming with tears, paced up and down, determined to act,
      and asking herself how she should act.
    

      There is one thing that must be said in justice to love; it is that the
      stronger, the clearer, the simpler the considerations opposed to it, in a
      word, the less common sense there is in the matter, the wilder does the
      passion become and the more does the lover love. It is one of the most
      beautiful things under heaven, this irrationality of the heart. We should
      not be worth much without it. After having walked about the room (without
      forgetting either her dear fan or the passing glance at the mirror), Julie
      allowed herself to sink once more upon her lounge. Whoever had seen her at
      this moment would have looked upon a lovely sight; her eyes sparkled, her
      cheeks were on fire; she sighed deeply, and murmured in a delicious
      transport of joy and pain:
    

      “Poor fellow! He has ruined himself for me!”
    

      Independently of the fortune which she could expect from her father,
      Mademoiselle Godeau had in her own right the property her mother had left
      her. She had never thought of it.
    

      At this moment, for the first time in her life, she remembered that she
      could dispose of five hundred thousand francs. This thought brought a
      smile to her lips; a project, strange, bold, wholly feminine, almost as
      mad as Croisilles himself, entered her head;—she weighed the idea in
      her mind for some time, then decided to act upon it at once.
    

      She began by inquiring whether Croisilles had any relatives or friends;
      the maid was sent out in all directions to find out.
    

      Having made minute inquiries in all quarters, she discovered, on the
      fourth floor of an old rickety house, a half-crippled aunt, who never
      stirred from her arm-chair, and had not been out for four or five years.
      This poor woman, very old, seemed to have been left in the world expressly
      as a specimen of hungry misery. Blind, gouty, almost deaf, she lived alone
      in a garret; but a gayety, stronger than misfortune and illness, sustained
      her at eighty years of age, and made her still love life. Her neighbors
      never passed her door without going in to see her, and the antiquated
      tunes she hummed enlivened all the girls of the neighborhood. She
      possessed a little annuity which sufficed to maintain her; as long as day
      lasted, she knitted. She did not know what had happened since the death of
      Louis XIV.
    

      It was to this worthy person that Julie had herself privately conducted.
      She donned for the occasion all her finery; feathers, laces, ribbons,
      diamonds, nothing was spared. She wanted to be fascinating; but the real
      secret of her beauty, in this case, was the whim that was carrying her
      away. She went up the steep, dark staircase which led to the good lady’s
      chamber, and, after the most graceful bow, spoke somewhat as follows:
    

      “You have, madame, a nephew, called Croisilles, who loves me and has
      asked for my hand; I love him too and wish to marry him; but my father,
      Monsieur Godeau, fermier-gÃ©nÃ©ral of this town, refuses his consent,
      because your nephew is not rich. I would not, for the world, give occasion
      to scandal, nor cause trouble to anybody; I would therefore never think of
      disposing of myself without the consent of my family. I come to ask you a
      favor, which I beseech you to grant me. You must come yourself and propose
      this marriage to my father. I have, thank God, a little fortune which is
      quite at your disposal; you may take possession, whenever you see fit, of
      five hundred thousand francs at my notary’s. You will say that this
      sum belongs to your nephew, which in fact it does. It is not a present
      that I am making him, it is a debt which I am paying, for I am the cause
      of the ruin of Croisilles, and it is but just that I should repair it. My
      father will not easily give in; you will be obliged to insist and you must
      have a little courage; I, for my part, will not fail. As nobody on earth
      excepting myself has any right to the sum of which I am speaking to you,
      nobody will ever know in what way this amount will have passed into your
      hands. You are not very rich yourself, I know, and you may fear that
      people will be astonished to see you thus endowing your nephew; but
      remember that my father does not know you, that you show yourself very
      little in town, and that, consequently it will be easy for you to pretend
      that you have just arrived from some journey. This step will doubtless be
      some exertion to you; you will have to leave your arm-chair and take a
      little trouble; but you will make two people happy, madame, and if you
      have ever known love, I hope you will not refuse me.”
    

      The old lady, during this discourse, had been in turn surprised, anxious,
      touched, and delighted. The last words persuaded her.
    

      “Yes, my child,” she repeated several times, “I know
      what it is,—I know what it is.”
    

      As she said this she made an effort to rise; her feeble limbs could barely
      support her; Julie quickly advanced and put out her hand to help her; by
      an almost involuntary movement they found themselves, in an instant, in
      each other’s arms.
    

      A treaty was at once concluded; a warm kiss sealed it in advance, and the
      necessary and confidential consultation followed without further trouble.
    

      All the explanations having been made, the good lady drew from her
      wardrobe a venerable gown of taffeta, which had been her wedding-dress.
      This antique piece of property was not less than fifty years old; but not
      a spot, not a grain of dust had disfigured it; Julie was in ecstasies over
      it. A coach was sent for, the handsomest in the town. The good lady
      prepared the speech she was going to make to Monsieur Godeau; Julie tried
      to teach her how she was to touch the heart of her father, and did not
      hesitate to confess that love of rank was his vulnerable point.
    

      “If you could imagine,” said she, “a means of flattering
      this weakness, you will have won our cause.”
    

      The good lady pondered deeply, finished her toilet without Another word,
      clasped the hands of her future niece, and entered the carriage.
    

      She soon arrived at the Godeau mansion; there, she braced herself up so
      gallantly for her entrance that she seemed ten years younger. She
      majestically crossed the drawing-room where Julie’s bouquet had
      fallen, and when the door of the boudoir opened, said in a firm voice to
      the lackey who preceded her:
    

      “Announce the dowager Baroness de Croisilles.”
    

      These words settled the happiness of the two lovers. Monsieur Godeau was
      bewildered by them. Although five hundred thousand francs seemed little to
      him, he consented to everything, in order to make his daughter a baroness,
      and such she became;—who would dare contest her title? For my part,
      I think she had thoroughly earned it.
