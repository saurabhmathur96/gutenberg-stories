'Gracious, Polly, I must
have that trout.' She almost riz right up, 'I knew you wa'n't sayin'
your catechism hearty. Is this the way you answer the question about
keepin' the Lord's day? I'm ashamed, Deacon Marble,' says she. 'You'd
better change your road, and go to meetin' on the road over the hill. If
I was a deacon, I wouldn't let a fish's tail whisk the whole catechism
out of my head'; and I had to go to meetin' on the hill road all the
rest of the summer."

  ENOUGH  BY TOM MASSON

  I shot a rocket in the air, 

 It fell to earth, I knew not where 

 Until next day, with rage profound, 

 The man it fell on came around. 

 In less time than it takes to tell, 

 He showed me where that rocket fell; 

 And now I do not greatly care 

 To shoot more rockets in the air.
