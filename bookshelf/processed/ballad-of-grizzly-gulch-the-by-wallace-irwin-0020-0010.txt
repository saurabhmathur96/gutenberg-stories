THE BALLAD OF GRIZZLY GULCH  BY WALLACE IRWIN

  The rocks are rough, the trail is tough, 

 The forest lies before, 

 As madly, madly to the hunt 

 Rides good King Theodore 

 With woodsmen, plainsmen, journalists 

 And kodaks thirty-four. 



 The bob-cats howl, the panthers growl, 

 "He sure is after us!" 

 As by his side lopes Bill, the Guide, 

 A wicked-looking cuss— 

 "Chee-chee!" the little birds exclaim, 

 "Ain't Teddy stren-oo-uss!" 



 Though dour the climb with slip and slime, 

 King Ted he doesn't care, 

 Till, cracking peanuts on a rock, 

 Behold, a Grizzly Bear! 

 King Theodore he shows his teeth, 

 But he never turns a hair. 



 "Come hither, Court Photographer," 

 The genial monarch saith, 

 "Be quick to snap your picture-trap 

 As I do yon Bear to death." 

 "Dee-lighted!" cries the smiling Bear, 

 As he waits and holds his breath. 

  Then speaks the Court Biographer, 

 And a handy guy is he, 

 "First let me wind my biograph, 

 That the deed recorded be." 

 "A square deal!" saith the patient Bear, 

 With ready repartee. 



 And now doth mighty Theodore 

 For slaughter raise his gun; 

 A flash, a bang, an ursine roar— 

 The dready deed is done! 

 And now the kodaks thirty-four 

 In chorus click as one. 



 The big brown bruin stricken falls 

 And in his juices lies; 

 His blood is spent, yet deep content 

 Beams from his limpid eyes. 

 "Congratulations, dear old pal!" 

 He murmurs as he dies. 



 From Cripple Creek and Soda Springs, 

 Gun Gulch and Gunnison, 

 A-foot, a-sock, the people flock 

 To see that deed of gun; 

 And parents bring huge families 

 To show what they have done. 



 In the damp corse stands Theodore 

 And takes a hand of each, 

 As loud and long the happy throng 

 Cries, "Speech!" again and "Speech!" 

 Which pleaseth well King Theodore, 

 Whose practice is to preach.





 "Good friends," he says, "lead outdoor lives 

 And Fame you yet may see— 

 Just look at Lincoln, Washington, 

 And great Napoleon B.; 

 And after that take off your hats 

 And you may look at me!" 



 But as he speaks, a Messenger 

 Cries, "Sire, a telegraft!" 

 The king up takes the wireless screed 

 Which he opens fore and aft, 

 And reads: "The Venezuelan stew 

 Is boiling over. TAFT." 



 Then straight the good King Theodore 

 In anger drops his gun 

 And turns his flashing spectacles 

 Toward high-domed Washington. 

 "O tush!" he saith beneath his breath, 

 "A man can't have no fun!" 



 Then comes a disappointed wail 

 From every rock and tree. 

 "Good-by, good-by!" the grizzlies cry 

 And wring their handkerchee. 

 And a sad bob-cat exclaims, "O drat! 

 He never shot at me!" 



 So backward, backward from the hunt 

 The monarch lopes once more. 

 The Constitution rides behind 

 And the Big Stick rides before 

 (Which was a rule of precedent 

 In the reign of Theodore).
