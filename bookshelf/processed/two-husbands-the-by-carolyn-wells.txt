THE TWO HUSBANDS
BY CAROLYN WELLS
Once on a Time there were Two Men, each of whom married the Woman of his
Choice. One Man devoted all his Energies to Getting Rich.
He was so absorbed in Acquiring Wealth that he Worked Night and Day to
Accomplish his End.
By this Means he lost his Health, he became a Nervous Wreck, and was so
Irritable and Irascible that his Wife Ceased to live with him and
Returned to her Parents' House.
The Other Man made no Efforts to Earn Money, and after he had Spent his
own and his Wife's Fortunes, Poverty Stared them in the Face.
Although his Wife had loved him Fondly, she could not Continue her
affection toward One who could not Support her, so she left him and
Returned to her Childhood's Home.
MORALS:
This Fable teaches that the Love of Money is the Root of All Evil, and
that When Poverty Comes In At the Door, Loves Flies Out Of the Window.
