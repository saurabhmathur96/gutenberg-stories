WHEN THE FROST IS ON THE PUNKIN

 BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY

  When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock, 

 And you hear the kyouck and gobble of the struttin' turkey-cock, 

 And the clackin' of the guineys, and the cluckin' of the hens, 

 And the rooster's hallelooyer as he tiptoes on the fence, 

 Oh, it's then's the time a feller is a feelin' at his best, 

 With the risin' sun to greet him from a night of gracious rest, 

 As he leaves the house bareheaded and goes out to feed the stock, 

 When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock. 



 There's sompin kind o' hearty-like about the atmosphere 

 When the heat of summer's over and the coolin' fall is here. 

 Of course we miss the flowers, and the blossoms on the trees, 

 And the mumble of the hummin'-birds and the buzzin' of the bees; 

 But the air's so appetizin', and the landscape through the haze 

 Of a crisp and sunny morning of the early autumn days 

 Is a picture that no painter has the colorin' to mock, 

 When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock.





 The husky, rusty rustle of the tassels of the corn, 

 And the raspin' of the tangled leaves as golden as the morn; 

 The stubble in the furries—kind o' lonesome like, but still 

 A preachin' sermons to us of the barns they growed to fill; 

 The straw-stack in the medder, and the reaper in the shed, 

 The hosses in their stalls below, the clover overhead,— 

 Oh, it sets my heart a clickin' like the tickin' of a clock, 

 When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock.
