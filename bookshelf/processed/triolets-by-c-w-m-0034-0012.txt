TRIOLETS

 BY C.W.M.

  She threw me a kiss, 

 But why did she throw it? 

 What grieves me is thisâ€” 

 She threw me a kiss; 

 Ah, what chances we miss 

 If we only could know it! 

 She threw me a kiss 

 But why did she throw it! 



 Any girl might have known 

 When I stood there so near! 

 And we two all alone 

 Any girl might have known 

 That she needn't have thrown! 

 But then girls are so queer! 

 Any girl might have known, 

 When I stood there so near!
