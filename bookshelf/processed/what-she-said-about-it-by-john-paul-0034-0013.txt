WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT IT

 BY JOHN PAUL

  Lyrics to Inez and Jane, 

 Dolores and Ethel and May; 

 Señoritas distant as Spain, 

 And damsels just over the way! 



 It is not that I'm jealous, nor that, 

 Of either Dolores or Jane, 

 Of some girl in an opposite flat, 

 Or in one of his castles in Spain, 



 But it is that salable prose 

 Put aside for this profitless strain, 

 I sit the day darning his hose— 

 And he sings of Dolores and Jane. 



 Though the winged-horse must caracole free— 

 With the pretty, when "spurning the plain," 

 Should the team-work fall wholly on me 

 While he soars with Dolores and Jane? 



 I am neither Dolores nor Jane, 

 But to lighten a little my life 

 Might the Poet not spare me a strain— 

 Although I am only his wife!
