    <h2>
      A LODGING FOR THE NIGHT, By Robert Louis Stevenson
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was late in November, 1456. The snow fell over Paris with rigorous,
      relentless persistence; sometimes the wind made a sally and scattered it
      in flying vortices; sometimes there was a lull, and flake after flake
      descended out of the black night air, silent, circuitous, interminable. To
      poor people, looking up under moist eyebrows, it seemed a wonder where it
      all came from. Master Francis Villon had propounded an alternative that
      afternoon, at a tavern window: was it only pagan Jupiter plucking geese
      upon Olympus? or were the holy angels moulting? He was only a poor Master
      of Arts, he went on; and as the question somewhat touched upon divinity,
      he durst not venture to conclude. A silly old priest from Montargis, who
      was among the company, treated the young rascal to a bottle of wine in
      honour of the jest and grimaces with which it was accompanied, and swore
      on his own white beard that he had been just such another irreverent dog
      when he was Villon&rsquo;s age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air was raw and pointed, but not far below freezing; and the flakes
      were large, damp, and adhesive. The whole city was sheeted up. An army
      might have marched from end to end and not a footfall given the alarm. If
      there were any belated birds in heaven, they saw the island like a large
      white patch, and the bridges like slim white spars on the black ground of
      the river. High up overhead the snow settled among the tracery of the
      cathedral towers. Many a niche was drifted full; many a statue wore a long
      white bonnet on its grotesque or sainted head. The gargoyles had been
      transformed into great false noses, drooping toward the point. The
      crockets were like upright pillows swollen on one side. In the intervals
      of the wind there was a dull sound dripping about the precincts of the
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cemetery of St. John had taken its own share of the snow. All the
      graves were decently covered; tall white housetops stood around in grave
      array; worthy burghers were long ago in bed, be-nightcapped like their
      domiciles; there was no light in all the neighbourhood but a little peep
      from a lamp that hung swinging in the church choir, and tossed the shadows
      to and fro in time to its oscillations. The clock was hard on ten when the
      patrol went by with halberds and a lantern, beating their hands; and they
      saw nothing suspicious about the cemetery of St. John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet there was a small house, backed up against the cemetery wall, which
      was still awake, and awake to evil purpose, in that snoring district.
      There was not much to betray it from without; only a stream of warm vapour
      from the chimney-top, a patch where the snow melted on the roof, and a few
      half-obliterated footprints at the door. But within, behind the shuttered
      windows, Master Francis Villon, the poet, and some of the thievish crew
      with whom he consorted, were keeping the night alive and passing round the
      bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great pile of living embers diffused a strong and ruddy glow from the
      arched chimney. Before this straddled Dom Nicolas, the Picardy monk, with
      his skirts picked up and his fat legs bared to the comfortable warmth. His
      dilated shadow cut the room in half; and the firelight only escaped on
      either side of his broad person, and in a little pool between his
      outspread feet. His face had the beery, bruised appearance of the
      continual drinker&rsquo;s; it was covered with a network of congested veins,
      purple in ordinary circumstances, but now pale violet, for even with his
      back to the fire the cold pinched him on the other side. His cowl had half
      fallen back, and made a strange excrescence on either side of his
      bull-neck. So he straddled, grumbling, and cut the room in half with the
      shadow of his portly frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the right, Villon and Guy Tabary were huddled together over a scrap of
      parchment; Villon making a ballade which he was to call the &ldquo;Ballade of
      Roast Fish,&rdquo; and Tabary sputtering admiration at his shoulder. The poet
      was a rag of a man, dark, little, and lean, with hollow cheeks and thin
      black locks. He carried his four and twenty years with feverish animation.
      Greed had made folds about his eyes, evil smiles had puckered his mouth.
      The wolf and pig struggled together in his face. It was an eloquent,
      sharp, ugly, earthly countenance. His hands were small and prehensile,
      with fingers knotted like a cord; and they were continually flickering in
      front of him in violent and expressive pantomime. As for Tabary, a broad,
      complacent, admiring imbecility breathed from his squash nose and
      slobbering lips; he had become a thief, just as he might have become the
      most decent of burgesses, by the imperious chance that rules the lives of
      human geese and human donkeys.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the monk&rsquo;s other hand, Montigny and Thevenin Pensete played a game of
      chance. About the first there clung some flavour of good birth and
      training, as about a fallen angel; something long, lithe, and courtly in
      the person; something aquiline and darkling in the face. Thevenin, poor
      soul, was in great feather; he had done a good stroke of knavery that
      afternoon in the Faubourg St. Jacques, and all night he had been gaining
      from Montigny. A flat smile illuminated his face; his bald head shone
      rosily in a garland of red curls; his little protuberant stomach shook
      with silent chucklings as he swept in his gains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubles or quits?&rdquo; said Thevenin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montigny nodded grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some may prefer to dine in state,&rdquo; wrote Villon, &ldquo;on bread and cheese on
      silver plate. Or, or&mdash;help me out, Guido!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tabary giggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or parsley on a golden dish,&rdquo; scribbled the poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind was freshening without; it drove the snow before it, and
      sometimes raised its voice in a victorious whoop, and made sepulchral
      grumblings in the chimney. The cold was growing sharper as the night went
      on. Villon, protruding his lips, imitated the gust with something between
      a whistle and a groan. It was an eerie, uncomfortable talent of the
      poet&rsquo;s, much detested by the Picardy monk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you hear it rattle in the gibbet?&rdquo; said Villon. &ldquo;They are all
      dancing the devil&rsquo;s jig on nothing, up there. You may dance, my gallants;
      you&rsquo;ll be none the warmer. Whew, what a gust! Down went somebody just now!
      A medlar the fewer on the three-legged medlar-tree! I say, Dom Nicolas,
      it&rsquo;ll be cold to-night on the St. Denis Road?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dom Nicholas winked both his big eyes, and seemed to choke upon his Adam&rsquo;s
      apple. Montfaucon, the great, grisly Paris gibbet, stood hard by the St.
      Denis Road, and the pleasantry touched him on the raw. As for Tabary, he
      laughed immoderately over the medlars; he had never heard anything more
      light-hearted; and he held his sides and crowed. Villon fetched him a
      fillip on the nose, which turned his mirth into an attack of coughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, stop that row,&rdquo; said Villon, &ldquo;and think of rhymes to &lsquo;fish&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubles or quits? Said Montigny, doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; quoth Thevenin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any more in that bottle?&rdquo; asked the monk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open another,&rdquo; said Villon. &ldquo;How do you ever hope to fill that big
      hogshead, your body, with little things like bottles? And how do you
      expect to get to heaven? How many angels, do you fancy, can be spared to
      carry up a single monk from Picardy? Or do you think yourself another
      Elias&mdash;and they&rsquo;ll send the coach for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Hominibus</i> impossible,&rdquo; replied the monk, as he filled his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tabary was in ecstasies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Villon filliped his nose again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laugh at my jokes, if you like,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Villon made a face at him. &ldquo;Think of rhymes to &lsquo;fish,&rsquo; &ldquo; he said. &ldquo;What
      have you to do with Latin? You&rsquo;ll wish you knew none of it at the great
      assizes, when the devil calls for Guido Tabary, <i>clericus</i>&mdash;the
      devil with the humpback and red-hot fingernails. Talking of the devil,&rdquo; he
      added, in a whisper, &ldquo;look at Montigny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All three peered covertly at the gamester. He did not seem to be enjoying
      his luck. His mouth was a little to a side; one nostril nearly shut, and
      the other much inflated. The black dog was on his back, as people say, in
      terrifying nursery metaphor; and he breathed hard under the gruesome
      burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks as if he could knife him,&rdquo; whispered Tabary, with round eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monk shuddered, and turned his face and spread his open hands to the
      red embers. It was the cold that thus affected Dom Nicolas, and not any
      excess of moral sensibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come now,&rdquo; said Villon&mdash;&ldquo;about this ballade. How does it run so
      far?&rdquo; And beating time with his hand, he read it aloud to Tabary.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were interrupted at the fourth rhyme by a brief and fatal movement
      among the gamesters. The round was completed, and Thevenin was just
      opening his mouth to claim another victory, when Montigny leaped up, swift
      as an adder, and stabbed him to the heart. The blow took effect before he
      had time to utter a cry, before he had time to move. A tremor or two
      convulsed his frame; his hands opened and shut, his heels rattled on the
      floor; then his head rolled backward over one shoulder, with eyes wide
      open; and Thevenin Pensete&rsquo;s spirit had returned to Him who made it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one sprang to his feet; but the business was over in two twos. The
      four living fellows looked at each other in rather a ghastly fashion, the
      dead man contemplating a corner of the roof with a singular and ugly leer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; said Tabary, and he began to pray in Latin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Villon broke out into hysterical laughter. He came a step forward and
      ducked a ridiculous bow at Thevenin, and laughed still louder. Then he sat
      down suddenly, all of a heap, upon a stool, and continued laughing
      bitterly, as though he would shake himself to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montigny recovered his composure first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what he has about him,&rdquo; he remarked; and he picked the dead
      man&rsquo;s pockets with a practised hand, and divided the money into four equal
      portions on the table. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s for you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monk received his share with a deep sigh, and a single stealthy glance
      at the dead Thevenin, who was beginning to sink into himself and topple
      sideways off the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all in for it,&rdquo; cried Villon, swallowing his mirth. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hanging
      job for every man Jack of us that&rsquo;s here&mdash;not to speak of those who
      aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He made a shocking gesture in the air with his raised right hand,
      and put out his tongue and threw his head on one side, so as to
      counterfeit the appearance of one who has been hanged. Then he pocketed
      his share of the spoil, and executed a shuffle with his feet as if to
      restore the circulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tabary was the last to help himself; he made a dash at the money, and
      retired to the other end of the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montigny stuck Thevenin upright in the chair, and drew out the dagger,
      which was followed by a jet of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fellows had better be moving,&rdquo; he said, as he wiped the blade on his
      victim&rsquo;s doublet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we had,&rdquo; returned Villon, with a gulp. &ldquo;Damn his fat head!&rdquo; he
      broke out. &ldquo;It sticks in my throat like phlegm. What right has a man to
      have red hair when he is dead?&rdquo; And he fell all of a heap again upon the
      stool, and fairly covered his face with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montigny and Dom Nicolas laughed aloud, even Tabary feebly chiming in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cry-baby!&rdquo; said the monk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always said he was a woman,&rdquo; added Montigny, with a sneer. &ldquo;Sit up,
      can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he went on, giving another shake to the murdered body. &ldquo;Tread
      out that fire, Nick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Nick was better employed; he was quietly taking Villon&rsquo;s purse, as the
      poet sat, limp and trembling, on the stool where he had been making a
      ballade not three minutes before. Montigny and Tabary dumbly demanded a
      share of the booty, which the monk silently promised as he passed the
      little bag into the bosom of his gown. In many ways an artistic nature
      unfits a man for practical existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had the theft been accomplished than Villon shook himself,
      jumped to his feet, and began helping to scatter and extinguish the
      embers. Meanwhile Montigny opened the door and cautiously peered into the
      street. The coast was clear; there was no meddlesome patrol in sight.
      Still it was judged wiser to slip out severally; and as Villon was himself
      in a hurry to escape from the neighbourhood of the dead Thevenin, and the
      rest were in a still greater hurry to get rid of him before he should
      discover the loss of his money, he was the first by general consent to
      issue forth into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind had triumphed and swept all the clouds from heaven. Only a few
      vapours, as thin as moonlight, fleeted rapidly across the stars. It was
      bitter cold; and, by a common optical effect, things seemed almost more
      definite than in the broadest daylight. The sleeping city was absolutely
      still; a company of white hoods, a field full of little alps, below the
      twinkling stars. Villon cursed his fortune. Would it were still snowing!
      Now, wherever he went, he left an indelible trail behind him on the
      glittering streets; wherever he went, he was still tethered to the house
      by the cemetery of St. John; wherever he went, he must weave, with his own
      plodding feet, the rope that bound him to the crime and would bind him to
      the gallows. The leer of the dead man came back to him with new
      significance. He snapped his fingers as if to pluck up his own spirits,
      and, choosing a street at random, stepped boldly forward in the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two things preoccupied him as he went: the aspect of the gallows at
      Montfaucon in this bright, windy phase of the night&rsquo;s existence, for one;
      and for another, the look of the dead man with his bald head and garland
      of red curls. Both struck cold upon his heart, and he kept quickening his
      pace as if he could escape from unpleasant thoughts by mere fleetness of
      foot. Sometimes he looked back over his shoulder with a sudden nervous
      jerk; but he was the only moving thing in the white streets, except when
      the wind swooped round a corner and threw up the snow, which was beginning
      to freeze, in spouts of glittering dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he saw, a long way before him, a black clump and a couple of
      lanterns. The clump was in motion, and the lanterns swung as though
      carried by men walking. It was a patrol. And though it was merely crossing
      his line of march he judged it wiser to get out of eyeshot as speedily as
      he could. He was not in the humour to be challenged, and he was conscious
      of making a very conspicuous mark upon the snow. Just on his left hand
      there stood a great hotel, with some turrets and a large porch before the
      door; it was half ruinous, he remembered, and had long stood empty; and so
      he made three steps of it, and jumped into the shelter of the porch. It
      was pretty dark inside, after the glimmer of the snowy streets, and he was
      groping forward with outspread hands, when he stumbled over some substance
      which offered an indescribable mixture of resistances, hard and soft, firm
      and loose. His heart gave a leap, and he sprang two steps back and stared
      dreadfully at the obstacle. Then he gave a little laugh of relief. It was
      only a woman, and she dead. He knelt beside her to make sure upon this
      latter point. She was freezing cold, and rigid like a stick. A little
      ragged finery fluttered in the wind about her hair, and her cheeks had
      been heavily rouged that same afternoon. Her pockets were quite empty; but
      in her stocking, underneath the garter, Villon found two of the small
      coins that went by the name of whites. It was little enough, but it was
      always something; and the poet was moved with a deep sense of pathos that
      she should have died before she had spent her money. That seemed to him a
      dark and pitiable mystery; and he looked from the coins in his hand to the
      dead woman, and back again to the coins, shaking his head over the riddle
      of man&rsquo;s life. Henry V. of England, dying at Vincennes just after he had
      conquered France, and this poor jade cut off by a cold draught in a great
      man&rsquo;s doorway before she had time to spend her couple of whites&mdash;it
      seemed a cruel way to carry on the world. Two whites would have taken such
      a little while to squander; and yet it would have been one more good taste
      in the mouth, one more smack of the lips, before the devil got the soul,
      and the body was left to birds and vermin. He would like to use all his
      tallow before the light was blown out and the lantern broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these thoughts were passing through his mind, he was feeling, half
      mechanically, for his purse. Suddenly his heart stopped beating; a feeling
      of cold scales passed up the back of his legs, and a cold blow seemed to
      fall upon his scalp. He stood petrified for a moment; then he felt again
      with one feverish movement; then his loss burst upon him, and he was
      covered at once with perspiration. To spendthrifts money is so living and
      actual&mdash;it is such a thin veil between them and their pleasures!
      There is only one limit to their fortune&mdash;that of time; and a
      spendthrift with only a few crowns is the Emperor of Rome until they are
      spent. For such a person to lose his money is to suffer the most shocking
      reverse, and fall from heaven to hell, from all to nothing, in a breath.
      And all the more if he has put his head in the halter for it; if he may be
      hanged to-morrow for that same purse, so dearly earned, so foolishly
      departed! Villon stood and cursed; he threw the two whites into the
      street; he shook his fist at heaven; he stamped, and was not horrified to
      find himself trampling the poor corpse. Then he began rapidly to retrace
      his steps toward the house beside the cemetery. He had forgotten all fear
      of the patrol, which was long gone by at any rate, and had no idea but
      that of his lost purse. It was in vain that he looked right and left upon
      the snow; nothing was to be seen. He had not dropped it in the streets.
      Had it fallen in the house? He would have liked dearly to go in and see;
      but the idea of the grisly occupant unmanned him. And he saw besides, as
      he drew near, that their efforts to put out the fire had been
      unsuccessful; on the contrary, it had broken into a blaze, and a changeful
      light played in the chinks of door and window, and revived his terror for
      the authorities and Paris gibbet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to the hotel with the porch, and groped about upon the snow
      for the money he had thrown away in his childish passion. But he could
      only find one white; the other had probably struck sideways and sunk
      deeply in. With a single white in his pocket, all his projects for a
      rousing night in some wild tavern vanished utterly away. And it was not
      only pleasure that fled laughing from his grasp; positive discomfort,
      positive pain, attacked him as he stood ruefully before the porch. His
      perspiration had dried upon him; and although the wind had now fallen, a
      binding frost was setting in stronger with every hour, and he felt
      benumbed and sick at heart. What was to be done? Late as was the hour,
      improbable as was his success, he would try the house of his adopted
      father, the chaplain of St. Benoit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran all the way, and knocked timidly. There was no answer. He knocked
      again and again, taking heart with every stroke; and at last steps were
      heard approaching from within. A barred wicket fell open in the
      iron-studded door, and emitted a gush of yellow light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold up your face to the wicket,&rdquo; said the chaplain from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only me,&rdquo; whimpered Villon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s only you, is it?&rdquo; returned the chaplain; and he cursed him with
      foul, unpriestly oaths for disturbing him at such an hour, and bade him be
      off to hell, where he came from.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My hands are blue to the wrist,&rdquo; pleaded Villon; &ldquo;my feet are dead and
      full of twinges; my nose aches with the sharp air; the cold lies at my
      heart. I may be dead before morning. Only this once, father, and, before
      God, I will never ask again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have come earlier,&rdquo; said the ecclesiastic, coolly. &ldquo;Young men
      require a lesson now and then.&rdquo; He shut the wicket and retired
      deliberately into the interior of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Villon was beside himself; he beat upon the door with his hands and feet,
      and shouted hoarsely after the chaplain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wormy old fox!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;If I had my hand under your twist, I would
      send you flying headlong into the bottomless pit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A door shut in the interior, faintly audible to the poet down long
      passages. He passed his hand over his mouth with an oath. And then the
      humour of the situation struck him, and he laughed and looked lightly up
      to heaven, where the stars seemed to be winking over his discomfiture.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was to be done? It looked very like a night in the frosty streets.
      The idea of the dead woman popped into his imagination, and gave him a
      hearty fright; what had happened to her in the early night might very well
      happen to him before morning. And he so young! And with such immense
      possibilities of disorderly amusement before him! He felt quite pathetic
      over the notion of his own fate, as if it had been some one else&rsquo;s, and
      made a little imaginative vignette of the scene in the morning when they
      should find his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed all his chances under review, turning the white between his
      thumb and forefinger. Unfortunately he was on bad terms with some old
      friends who would once have taken pity on him in such a plight. He had
      lampooned them in verses; he had beaten and cheated them; and yet now,
      when he was in so close a pinch, he thought there was at least one who
      might perhaps relent. It was a chance. It was worth trying at least, and
      he would go and see.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way, two little accidents happened to him which coloured his
      musings in a very different manner. For, first, he fell in with the track
      of a patrol, and walked in it for some hundred yards, although it lay out
      of his direction. And this spirited him up; at least he had confused his
      trail; for he was still possessed with the idea of people tracking him all
      about Paris over the snow, and collaring him next morning before he was
      awake. The other matter affected him quite differently. He passed a
      street-corner where, not so long before, a woman and her child had been
      devoured by wolves. This was just the kind of weather, he reflected, when
      wolves might take it into their heads to enter Paris again; and a lone man
      in these deserted streets would run the chance of something worse than a
      mere scare. He stopped and looked upon the place with an unpleasant
      interest&mdash;it was a centre where several lanes intersected each other;
      and he looked down them all, one after another, and held his breath to
      listen, lest he should detect some galloping black things on the snow or
      hear the sound of howling between him and the river. He remembered his
      mother telling him the story and pointing out the spot, while he was yet a
      child. His mother! If he only knew where she lived, he might make sure at
      least of shelter. He determined he would inquire upon the morrow; nay, he
      would go and see her, too, poor old girl! So thinking, he arrived at his
      destination&mdash;his last hope for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was quite dark, like its neighbours; and yet after a few taps he
      heard a movement overhead, a door opening, and a cautious voice asking who
      was there. The poet named himself in a loud whisper, and waited, not
      without some trepidation, the result. Nor had he to wait long. A window
      was suddenly opened, and a pailful of slops splashed down upon the
      door-step. Villon had not been unprepared for something of the sort, and
      had put himself as much in shelter as the nature of the porch admitted;
      but for all that he was deplorably drenched below the waist. His hose
      began to freeze almost at once. Death from cold and exposure stared him in
      the face; he remembered he was of phthisical tendency, and began coughing
      tentatively. But the gravity of the danger steadied his nerves. He stopped
      a few hundred yards from the door where he had been so rudely used, and
      reflected with his finger to his nose. He could only see one way of
      getting a lodging, and that was to take it. He had noticed a house not far
      away, which looked as if it might be easily broken into; and thither he
      betook himself promptly, entertaining himself on the way with the idea of
      a room still hot, with a table still loaded with the remains of supper,
      where he might pass the rest of the black hours, and whence he should
      issue, on the morrow, with an armful of valuable plate. He even considered
      on what viands and what wines he should prefer; and as he was calling the
      roll of his favourite dainties, roast fish presented itself to his mind
      with an odd mixture of amusement and horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never finish that ballade,&rdquo; he thought to himself; and then, with
      another shudder at the recollection, &ldquo;Oh, damn his fat head!&rdquo; he repeated,
      fervently, and spat upon the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house in question looked dark at first sight; but as Villon made a
      preliminary inspection in search of the handiest point of attack, a little
      twinkle of light caught his eye from behind a curtained window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;People awake! Some student or some saint,
      confound the crew! Can&rsquo;t they get drunk and lie in bed snoring like their
      neighbours? What&rsquo;s the good of curfew, and poor devils of bell-ringers
      jumping at a rope&rsquo;s end in bell-towers? What&rsquo;s the use of day, if people
      sit up all night? The gripes to them!&rdquo; He grinned as he saw where his
      logic was leading him. &ldquo;Every man to his business, after all,&rdquo; added he,
      &ldquo;and if they&rsquo;re awake, by the Lord, I may come by a supper honestly for
      once, and cheat the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went boldly to the door and knocked with an assured hand. On both
      previous occasions he had knocked timidly and with some dread of
      attracting notice; but now when he had just discarded the thought of a
      burglarious entry, knocking at a door seemed a mighty simple and innocent
      proceeding. The sound of his blows echoed through the house with thin,
      phantasmal reverberations, as though it were quite empty; but these had
      scarcely died away before a measured tread drew near, a couple of bolts
      were withdrawn, and one wing was opened broadly, as though no guile or
      fear of guile were known to those within. A tall figure of a man, muscular
      and spare, but a little bent, confronted Villon. The head was massive in
      bulk, but finely sculptured; the nose blunt at the bottom, but refining
      upward to where it joined a pair of strong and honest eyebrows; the mouth
      and eyes surrounded with delicate markings; and the whole face based upon
      a thick white beard, boldly and squarely trimmed. Seen as it was by the
      light of a flickering hand-lamp, it looked perhaps nobler than it had a
      right to do; but it was a fine face, honourable rather than intelligent,
      strong, simple, and righteous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knock late, sir,&rdquo; said the old man, in resonant, courteous tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Villon cringed, and brought up many servile words of apology; at a crisis
      of this sort, the beggar was uppermost in him, and the man of genius hid
      his head with confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are cold,&rdquo; repeated the old man, &ldquo;and hungry? Well, step in.&rdquo; And he
      ordered him into the house with a noble enough gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some great seigneur,&rdquo; thought Villon, as his host, setting down the lamp
      on the flagged pavement of the entry, shot the bolts once more into their
      places.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will pardon me if I go in front,&rdquo; he said, when this was done; and he
      preceded the poet upstairs into a large apartment, warmed with a pan of
      charcoal and lit by a great lamp hanging from the roof. It was very bare
      of furniture; only some gold plate on a sideboard, some folios, and a
      stand of armour between the windows. Some smart tapestry hung upon the
      walls, representing the crucifixion of our Lord in one piece, and in
      another a scene of shepherds and shepherdesses by a running stream. Over
      the chimney was a shield of arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you seat yourself,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;and forgive me if I leave
      you? I am alone in my house to-night, and if you are to eat I must forage
      for you myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was his host gone than Villon leaped from the chair on which he
      had just seated himself, and began examining the room with the stealth and
      passion of a cat. He weighed the gold flagons in his hand, opened all the
      folios, and investigated the arms upon the shield, and the stuff with
      which the seats were lined. He raised the window curtains, and saw that
      the windows were set with rich stained glass in figures, so far as he
      could see, of martial import. Then he stood in the middle of the room,
      drew a long breath, and retaining it with puffed cheeks, looked round and
      round him, turning on his heels, as if to impress every feature of the
      apartment on his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven pieces of plate,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If there had been ten, I would have
      risked it. A fine house, and a fine old master, so help me all the
      saints!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And just then, hearing the old man&rsquo;s tread returning along the corridor,
      he stole back to his chair, and began humbly toasting his wet legs before
      the charcoal pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      His entertainer had a plate of meat in one hand and a jug of wine in the
      other. He set down the plate upon the table, motioning Villon to draw in
      his chair, and going to the sideboard, brought back two goblets, which he
      filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I drink your better fortune,&rdquo; he said gravely, touching Villon&rsquo;s cup with
      his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To our better acquaintance,&rdquo; said the poet, growing bold. A mere man of
      the people would have been awed by the courtesy of the old seigneur, but
      Villon was hardened in that matter; he had made mirth for great lords
      before now, and found them as black rascals as himself. And so he devoted
      himself to the viands with a ravenous gusto, while the old man, leaning
      backward, watched him with steady, curious eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have blood on your shoulder, my man,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montigny must have laid his wet right hand upon him as he left the house.
      He cursed Montigny in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was none of my shedding,&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not supposed so,&rdquo; returned his host, quietly. &ldquo;A brawl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, something of that sort,&rdquo; Villon admitted, with a quaver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps a fellow murdered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, not murdered,&rdquo; said the poet, more and more confused. &ldquo;It was all
      fair play&mdash;murdered by accident. I had no hand in it, God strike me
      dead!&rdquo; he added, fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One rogue the fewer, I dare say,&rdquo; observed the master of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may dare to say that,&rdquo; agreed Villon, infinitely relieved. &ldquo;As big a
      rogue as there is between here and Jerusalem. He turned up his toes like a
      lamb. But it was a nasty thing to look at. I dare say you&rsquo;ve seen dead men
      in your time, my lord?&rdquo; he added, glancing at the armour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;I have followed the wars, as you imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Villon laid down his knife and fork, which he had just taken up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were any of them bald?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, and with hair as white as mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should mind the white so much,&rdquo; said Villon. &ldquo;His was
      red.&rdquo; And he had a return of his shuddering and tendency to laughter,
      which he drowned with a great draught of wine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little put out when
      I think of it,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I knew him&mdash;damn him! And then the cold
      gives a man fancies&mdash;or the fancies give a man cold, I don&rsquo;t know
      which.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any money?&rdquo; asked the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have one white,&rdquo; returned the poet, laughing. &ldquo;I got it out of a dead
      jade&rsquo;s stocking in a porch. She was as dead as Caesar, poor wench, and as
      cold as a church, with bits of ribbon sticking in her hair. This is a hard
      winter for wolves and wenches and poor rogues like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;am Enguerrand de la Feuillee, seigneur de
      Brisetout, bailie du Patatrac. Who and what may you be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Villon rose and made a suitable reverence. &ldquo;I am called Francis Villon,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;a poor Master of Arts of this university. I know some Latin, and
      a deal of vice. I can make Chansons, ballades, lais, virelais, and
      roundels, and I am very fond of wine. I was born in a garret, and I shall
      not improbably die upon the gallows. I may add, my lord, that from this
      night forward I am your lordship&rsquo;s very obsequious servant to command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No servant of mine,&rdquo; said the knight. &ldquo;My guest for this evening, and no
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very grateful guest,&rdquo; said Villon, politely, and he drank in dumb show
      to his entertainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are shrewd,&rdquo; began the old man, tapping his forehead, &ldquo;very shrewd;
      you have learning; you are a clerk; and yet you take a small piece of
      money off a dead woman in the street. Is it not a kind of theft?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a kind of theft much practised in the wars, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wars are the field of honour,&rdquo; returned the old man, proudly. &ldquo;There
      a man plays his life upon the cast; he fights in the name of his lord the
      king, his Lord God, and all their lordships the holy saints and angels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it,&rdquo; said Villon, &ldquo;that I were really a thief, should I not play my
      life also, and against heavier odds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For gain, but not for honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gain?&rdquo; repeated Villon, with a shrug. &ldquo;Gain! The poor fellow wants
      supper, and takes it. So does the soldier in a campaign. Why, what are all
      these requisitions we hear so much about? If they are not gain to those
      who take them, they are loss enough to the others. The men-at-arms drink
      by a good fire, while the burgher bites his nails to buy them wine and
      wood. I have seen a good many ploughmen swinging on trees about the
      country; ay, I have seen thirty on one elm, and a very poor figure they
      made; and when I asked some one how all these came to be hanged, I was
      told it was because they could not scrape together enough crowns to
      satisfy the men-at-arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These things are a necessity of war, which the low-born must endure with
      constancy. It is true that some captains drive overhard; there are spirits
      in every rank not easily moved by pity; and indeed many follow arms who
      are no better than brigands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the poet, &ldquo;you cannot separate the soldier from the
      brigand; and what is a thief but an isolated brigand with circumspect
      manners? I steal a couple of mutton-chops, without so much as disturbing
      people&rsquo;s sleep; the farmer grumbles a bit, but sups none the less
      wholesomely on what remains. You come up blowing gloriously on a trumpet,
      take away the whole sheep, and beat the farmer pitifully into the bargain.
      I have no trumpet; I am only Tom, Dick, or Harry; I am a rogue and a dog,
      and hanging&rsquo;s too good for me&mdash;with all my heart; but just ask the
      farmer which of us he prefers, just find out which of us he lies awake to
      curse on cold nights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at us two,&rdquo; said his lordship. &ldquo;I am old, strong, and honoured. If I
      were turned from my house to-morrow, hundreds would be proud to shelter
      me. Poor people would go out and pass the night in the streets with their
      children, if I merely hinted that I wished to be alone. And I find you up,
      wandering homeless, and picking farthings off dead women by the wayside! I
      fear no man and nothing; I have seen you tremble and lose countenance at a
      word. I wait God&rsquo;s summons contentedly in my own house, or, if it please
      the king to call me out again, upon the field of battle. You look for the
      gallows; a rough, swift death, without hope or honour. Is there no
      difference between these two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as to the moon,&rdquo; Villon acquiesced. &ldquo;But if I had been born lord
      of Brisetout, and you had been the poor scholar Francis, would the
      difference have been any the less? Should not I have been warming my knees
      at this charcoal pan, and would not you have been groping for farthings in
      the snow? Should not I have been the soldier, and you the thief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thief?&rdquo; cried the old man. &ldquo;I a thief! If you understood your words,
      you would repent them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Villon turned out his hands with a gesture of inimitable impudence. &ldquo;If
      your lordship had done me the honour to follow my argument!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do you too much honour in submitting to your presence,&rdquo; said the
      knight. &ldquo;Learn to curb your tongue when you speak with old and honourable
      men, or some one hastier than I may reprove you in a sharper fashion.&rdquo; And
      he rose and paced the lower end of the apartment, struggling with anger
      and antipathy. Villon surreptitiously refilled his cup, and settled
      himself more comfortably in the chair, crossing his knees and leaning his
      head upon one hand and the elbow against the back of the chair. He was now
      replete and warm; and he was in no wise frightened for his host, having
      gauged him as justly as was possible between two such different
      characters. The night was far spent, and in a very comfortable fashion
      after all; and he felt morally certain of a safe departure on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me one thing,&rdquo; said the old man, pausing in his walk. &ldquo;Are you
      really a thief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I claim the sacred rights of hospitality,&rdquo; returned the poet. &ldquo;My lord, I
      am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very young,&rdquo; the knight continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should never have been so old,&rdquo; replied Villon, showing his fingers,
      &ldquo;if I had not helped myself with these ten talents. They have been my
      nursing mothers and my nursing fathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may still repent and change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repent daily,&rdquo; said the poet. &ldquo;There are few people more given to
      repentance than poor Francis. As for change, let somebody change my
      circumstances. A man must continue to eat, if it were only that he may
      continue to repent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The change must begin in the heart,&rdquo; returned the old man, solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear lord,&rdquo; answered Villon, &ldquo;do you really fancy that I steal for
      pleasure? I hate stealing, like any other piece of work or of danger. My
      teeth chatter when I see a gallows. But I must eat, I must drink; I must
      mix in society of some sort. What the devil! Man is not a solitary animal&mdash;<i>cui
      Deus foeminam tradit</i>. Make me king&rsquo;s pantler, make me Abbot of St.
      Denis, make me bailie of the Patatrac, and then I shall be changed indeed.
      But as long as you leave me the poor scholar Francis Villon, without a
      farthing, why, of course, I remain the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The grace of God is all powerful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be a heretic to question it,&rdquo; said Francis. &ldquo;It has made you
      lord of Brisetout and bailie of the Patatrac; it has given me nothing but
      the quick wits under my hat and these ten toes upon my hands. May I help
      myself to wine? I thank you respectfully. By God&rsquo;s grace, you have a very
      superior vintage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lord of Brisetout walked to and fro with his hands behind his back.
      Perhaps he was not yet quite settled in his mind about the parallel
      between thieves and soldiers; perhaps Villon had interested him by some
      cross-thread of sympathy; perhaps his wits were simply muddled by so much
      unfamiliar reasoning; but whatever the cause, he somehow yearned to
      convert the young man to a better way of thinking, and could not make up
      his mind to drive him forth again into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something more than I can understand in this,&rdquo; he said at
      length. &ldquo;Your mouth is full of subtleties, and the devil has led you very
      far astray; but the devil is only a very weak spirit before God&rsquo;s truth,
      and all his subtleties vanish at a word of true honour, like darkness at
      morning. Listen to me once more. I learned long ago that a gentleman
      should live chivalrously and lovingly to God and the king and his lady;
      and though I have seen many strange things done, I have still striven to
      command my ways upon that rule. It is not only written in all noble
      histories, but in every man&rsquo;s heart, if he will take care to read. You
      speak of food and wine, and I know very well that hunger is a difficult
      trial to endure; but you do not speak of other wants; you say nothing of
      honour, of faith to God and other men, of courtesy, of love without
      reproach. It may be that I am not very wise,&mdash;and yet I think I am,&mdash;but
      you seem to me like one who has lost his way and made a great error in
      life. You are attending to the little wants, and you have totally
      forgotten the great and only real ones, like a man who should be doctoring
      toothache on the judgment day. For such things as honour and love and
      faith are not only nobler than food and drink, but indeed I think we
      desire them more, and suffer more sharply for their absence. I speak to
      you as I think you will most easily understand me. Are you not, while
      careful to fill your belly, disregarding another appetite in your heart,
      which spoils the pleasure of your life and keeps you continually
      wretched?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Villon was sensibly nettled under all this sermonising. &ldquo;You think I have
      no sense of honour!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m poor enough, God knows! It&rsquo;s hard to
      see rich people with their gloves, and you blowing in your hands. An empty
      belly is a bitter thing, although you speak so lightly of it. If you had
      had as many as I, perhaps you would change your tune. Anyway, I&rsquo;m a thief,&mdash;make
      the most of that,&mdash;but I&rsquo;m not a devil from hell, God strike me dead!
      I would have you to know I&rsquo;ve an honour of my own, as good as yours,
      though I don&rsquo;t prate about it all day long, as if it was a God&rsquo;s miracle
      to have any. It seems quite natural to me; I keep it in its box till it&rsquo;s
      wanted. Why, now, look you here, how long have I been in this room with
      you? Did you not tell me you were alone in the house? Look at your gold
      plate! You&rsquo;re strong, if you like, but you&rsquo;re old and unarmed, and I have
      my knife. What did I want but a jerk of the elbow and here would have been
      you with the cold steel in your bowels, and there would have been me,
      linking in the streets, with an armful of golden cups! Did you suppose I
      hadn&rsquo;t wit enough to see that? and I scorned the action. There are your
      damned goblets, as safe as in a church; there are you, with your heart
      ticking as good as new; and here am I, ready to go out again as poor as I
      came in, with my one white that you threw in my teeth! And you think I
      have no sense of honour&mdash;God strike me dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man stretched out his right arm. &ldquo;I will tell you what you are,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;You are a rogue, my man, an impudent and black-hearted rogue and
      vagabond. I have passed an hour with you. Oh, believe me, I feel myself
      disgraced! And you have eaten and drunk at my table. But now I am sick at
      your presence; the day has come, and the night-bird should be off to his
      roost. Will you go before, or after?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which you please,&rdquo; returned the poet, rising. &ldquo;I believe you to be
      strictly honourable.&rdquo; He thoughtfully emptied his cup. &ldquo;I wish I could add
      you were intelligent,&rdquo; he went on, knocking on his head with his knuckles.
      &ldquo;Age! age! the brains stiff and rheumatic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man preceded him from a point of self-respect; Villon followed,
      whistling, with his thumbs in his girdle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God pity you,&rdquo; said the lord of Brisetout at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, papa,&rdquo; returned Villon, with a yawn. &ldquo;Many thanks for the cold
      mutton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door closed behind him. The dawn was breaking over the white roofs. A
      chill, uncomfortable morning ushered in the day. Villon stood and heartily
      stretched himself in the middle of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very dull old gentleman,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I wonder what his goblets may be
      worth?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      A LEAF IN THE STORM, By Ouida
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Berceau de Dieu was a little village in the valley of the Seine. As a
      lark drops its nest among the grasses, so a few peasant people had dropped
      their little farms and cottages amid the great green woods on the winding
      river. It was a pretty place, with one steep, stony street, shady with
      poplars and with elms; quaint houses, about whose thatch a cloud of white
      and gray pigeons fluttered all day long; a little aged chapel with a
      conical red roof; and great barns covered with ivy and thick creepers, red
      and purple, and lichens that were yellow in the sun. All around it were
      the broad, flowering meadows, with the sleek cattle of Normandy fattening
      in them, and the sweet dim forests where the young men and maidens went on
      every holy day and feast-day in the summer-time to seek for wood-anemones,
      and lilies of the pools, and the wild campanula, and the fresh dog-rose,
      and all the boughs and grasses that made their house-doors like garden
      bowers, and seemed to take the cushat&rsquo;s note and the linnet&rsquo;s song into
      their little temple of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Berceau de Dieu was very old indeed. Men said that the hamlet had been
      there in the day of the Virgin of Orleans; and a stone cross of the
      twelfth century still stood by the great pond of water at the bottom of
      the street under the chestnut-tree, where the villagers gathered to gossip
      at sunset when their work was done. It had no city near it, and no town
      nearer than four leagues. It was in the green care of a pastoral district,
      thickly wooded and intersected with orchards. Its produce of wheat and
      oats and cheese and fruit and eggs was more than sufficient for its simple
      prosperity. Its people were hardy, kindly, laborious, happy; living round
      the little gray chapel in amity and good-fellowship. Nothing troubled it.
      War and rumours of war, revolutions and counter-revolutions, empires and
      insurrections, military and political questions&mdash;these all were for
      it things unknown and unheard of, mighty winds that arose and blew and
      swept the lands around it, but never came near enough to harm it, lying
      there, as it did in its loneliness like any lark&rsquo;s nest. Even in the great
      days of the Revolution it had been quiet. It had had a lord whom it loved
      in the old castle on the hill at whose feet it nestled; it had never tried
      to harm him, and it had wept bitterly when he had fallen at Jemmapes, and
      left no heir, and the chateau had crumbled into ivy-hung ruins. The
      thunder-heats of that dread time had scarcely scorched it. It had seen a
      few of its best youth march away to the chant of the Marseillaise to fight
      on the plains of Champagne; and it had been visited by some patriots in <i>bonnets
      rouges</i> and soldiers in blue uniforms, who had given it tricoloured
      cockades and bade it wear them in the holy name of the Republic one and
      indivisible. But it had not known what these meant, and its harvests had
      been reaped without the sound of a shot in its fields or any gleam of
      steel by its innocent hearths; so that the terrors and the tidings of
      those noble and ghastly years had left no impress on its generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine Allix, indeed, the oldest woman among them all, numbering more than
      ninety years, remembered when she was a child hearing her father and his
      neighbours talk in low, awe-stricken tones one bitter wintry night of how
      a king had been slain to save the people; and she remembered likewise&mdash;remembered
      it well, because it had been her betrothal night and the sixteenth
      birthday of her life&mdash;how a horseman had flashed through the startled
      street like a comet, and had called aloud, in a voice of fire, &ldquo;<i>Gloire!
      gloire! gloire!</i>&mdash;Marengo! Marengo! Marengo!&rdquo; and how the village
      had dimly understood that something marvellous for France had happened
      afar off, and how her brothers and her cousins and her betrothed, and she
      with them, had all gone up to the high slope over the river, and had piled
      up a great pyramid of pine wood and straw and dried mosses, and had set
      flame to it, till it had glowed in its scarlet triumph all through that
      wondrous night of the sultry summer of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      These and the like memories she would sometimes relate to the children at
      evening when they gathered round her begging for a story. Otherwise, no
      memories of the Revolution or the Empire disturbed the tranquility of the
      Berceau; and even she, after she had told them, would add, &ldquo;I am not sure
      now what Marengo was. A battle, no doubt, but I am not sure where nor why.
      But we heard later that little Claudis, my aunt&rsquo;s youngest-born, a
      volunteer not nineteen, died at it. If we had known, we should not have
      gone up and lit the bonfire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This woman, who had been born in that time of famine and flame, was the
      happiest creature in the whole hamlet of the Berceau. &ldquo;I am old; yes, I am
      very old,&rdquo; she would say, looking up from her spinning-wheel in her
      house-door, and shading her eyes from the sun, &ldquo;very old&mdash;ninety-two
      last summer. But when one has a roof over one&rsquo;s head, and a pot of soup
      always, and a grandson like mine, and when one has lived all one&rsquo;s life in
      the Berceau de Dieu, then it is well to be so old. Ah, yes, my little
      ones,&mdash;yes, though you doubt it, you little birds that have just
      tried your wings,&mdash;it is well to be so old. One has time to think,
      and thank the good God, which one never seemed to have a minute to do in
      that work, work, work when one was young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reine Allix was a tall and strong woman, very withered and very bent and
      very brown, yet with sweet, dark, flashing eyes that had still light in
      them, and a face that was still noble, though nearly a century had bronzed
      it with its harvest suns and blown on it with its winter winds. She wore
      always the same garb of homely dark-blue serge, always the same tall white
      head-gear, always the same pure silver ear-rings that had been at once an
      heirloom and a nuptial gift. She was always shod in her wooden sabots, and
      she always walked abroad with a staff of ash. She had been born in the
      Berceau de Dieu; had lived there and wedded there; had toiled there all
      her life, and never left it for a greater distance than a league, or for a
      longer time than a day. She loved it with an intense love. The world
      beyond it was nothing to her; she scarcely believed in it as existing. She
      could neither read nor write. She told the truth, reared her offspring in
      honesty, and praised God always&mdash;had praised Him when starving in a
      bitter winter after her husband&rsquo;s death, when there had been no field
      work, and she had had five children to feed and clothe; and praised Him
      now that her sons were all dead before her, and all she had living of her
      blood was her grandson Bernadou.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her life had been a hard one. Her parents had been hideously poor. Her
      marriage had scarcely bettered her condition. She had laboured in the
      fields always, hoeing and weeding and reaping and carrying wood and
      driving mules, and continually rising with the first streak of daybreak.
      She had known fever and famine and all manner of earthly ills. But now in
      her old age she had peace. Two of her dead sons, who had sought their
      fortunes in the other hemisphere, had left her a little money, and she had
      a little cottage and a plot of ground, and a pig, and a small orchard. She
      was well-to-do, and could leave it all to Bernadou; and for ten years she
      had been happy, perfectly happy, in the coolness and the sweetness and the
      old familiar ways and habits of the Berceau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernadou was very good to her. The lad, as she called him, was five and
      twenty years old, tall and straight and clean-limbed, with the blue eyes
      of the North, and a gentle, frank face. He worked early and late in the
      plot of ground that gave him his livelihood. He lived with his
      grandmother, and tended her with a gracious courtesy and veneration that
      never altered. He was not very wise; he also could neither read nor write;
      he believed in his priest and his homestead, and loved the ground that he
      had trodden ever since his first steps from the cradle had been guided by
      Reine Allix. He had never been drawn for the conscription, because he was
      the only support of a woman of ninety; he likewise had never been half a
      dozen kilometres from his birthplace. When he was bidden to vote, and he
      asked what his vote of assent would pledge him to do, they told him, &ldquo;It
      will bind you to honour your grandmother so long as she shall live, and to
      get up with the lark, and to go to mass every Sunday, and to be a loyal
      son to your country. Nothing more.&rdquo; And thereat he had smiled and
      straightened his stalwart frame, and gone right willingly to the
      voting-urn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very stupid in these things; and Reine Allix, though clear-headed
      and shrewd, was hardly more learned in them than he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look you,&rdquo; she had said to him oftentimes, &ldquo;in my babyhood there was the
      old white flag upon the chateau. Well, they pulled that down and put up a
      red one. That toppled and fell, and there was one of three colours. Then
      somebody with a knot of white lilies in his hand came one day and set up
      the old white one afresh; and before the day was done that was down again
      and the tricolour again up where it is. Now, some I know fretted
      themselves greatly because of all these changes of the flags; but as for
      me, I could not see that any one of them mattered: bread was just as dear
      and sleep was just as sweet whichever of the three was uppermost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadou, who had never known but the flag of three colours, believed her,
      as indeed he believed every word that those kindly and resolute old lips
      ever uttered to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never been in a city, and only once, on the day of his first
      communion, in the town four leagues away. He knew nothing more than this
      simple, cleanly, honest life that he led. With what men did outside his
      little world of meadow-land and woodland he had no care nor any concern.
      Once a man had come through the village of the Berceau, a travelling
      hawker of cheap prints,&mdash;a man with a wild eye and a restless brain,&mdash;who
      told Bernadou that he was a downtrodden slave, a clod, a beast like a
      mule, who fetched and carried that the rich might fatten, a dolt, an
      idiot, who cared nothing for the rights of man and the wrongs of the poor.
      Bernadou had listened with a perplexed face; then with a smile, that had
      cleared it like sunlight, he had answered, in his country dialect, &ldquo;I do
      not know of what you speak. Rights? Wrongs? I cannot tell, But I have
      never owned a sou; I have never told a lie; I am strong enough to hold my
      own with any man that flouts me; and I am content where I am. That is
      enough for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The peddler had called him a poor-spirited beast of burden, but had said
      so out of reach of his arm, and by night had slunk away from the Berceau
      de Dieu, and had been no more seen there to vex the quiet contentment of
      its peaceful and peace-loving ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night, indeed, sometimes, the little wine-shop of the village would be
      frequented by some half-dozen of the peasant proprietors of the place, who
      talked communism after their manner, not a very clear one, in excited
      tones and with the feverish glances of conspirators. But it meant little,
      and came to less. The weather and the price of wheat were dearer matters
      to them; and in the end they usually drank their red wine in amity, and
      went up the village street arm in arm, singing patriotic songs until their
      angry wives flung open their lattices and thrust their white head-gear out
      into the moonlight, and called to them shrewishly to get to bed and not
      make fools of themselves in that fashion; which usually silenced and
      sobered them all instantly; so that the revolutions of the Berceau de
      Dieu, if not quenched in a wine-pot, were always smothered in a nightcap,
      and never by any chance disturbed its repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of these noisy patriots Bernadou was never one. He had the instinctive
      conservatism of the French peasant, which is in such direct and tough
      antagonism with the feverish socialism of the French artisan. His love was
      for the soil&mdash;a love deep-rooted as the oaks that grew in it. Of
      Paris he had a dim, vague dread, as of a superb beast continually draining
      and devouring. Of all forms of government he was alike ignorant. So long
      as he tilled his little angle of land in peace, so long as the sun ripened
      his fruits and corn, so long as famine was away from his door and his
      neighbours dwelt in good-fellowship with him, so long he was happy, and
      cared not whether he was thus happy under a monarchy, an empire, or a
      republic. This wisdom, which the peddler called apathy and cursed, the
      young man had imbibed from nature and the teachings of Reine Allix. &ldquo;Look
      at home and mind thy word,&rdquo; she had said always to him. &ldquo;It is labour
      enough for a man to keep his own life clean and his own hands honest. Be
      not thou at any time as they are who are for ever telling the good God how
      He might have made the world on a better plan, while the rats gnaw at
      their hay-stacks and the children cry over an empty platter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he had taken heed to her words, so that in all the country-side there
      was not any lad truer, gentler, braver, or more patient at labour than was
      Bernadou; and though some thought him mild even to foolishness, and meek
      even to stupidity, he was no fool; and he had a certain rough skill at
      music, and a rare gift at the culture of plants, and made his little home
      bright within the winter-time with melody, and in the summer gay without
      as a king&rsquo;s parterre.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, Reine Allix and he had been happy together for a quarter of a
      century under the old gray thatch of the wayside cottage, where it stood
      at the foot of the village street, with its great sycamores spread above
      it. Nor were they less happy when in mid-April, in the six and twentieth
      year of his age, Bernadou had come in with a bunch of primroses in his
      hand, and had bent down to her and saluted her with a respectful
      tenderness, and said softly and a little shyly, &ldquo;<i>Gran&rsquo;mere</i>, would
      it suit you if I were ever&mdash;to marry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reine Allix was silent a minute and more, cherishing the primroses and
      placing them in a little brown cupful of water. Then she looked at him
      steadily with her clear, dark eyes. &ldquo;Who is it, my child?&rdquo; He was always a
      child to her, this last-born of the numerous brood that had once dwelt
      with her under the spreading branches of the sycamores, and had now all
      perished off the face of the earth, leaving himself and her alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernadou&rsquo;s eyes met hers frankly. &ldquo;It is Margot Dal. Does that please you,
      <i>gran&rsquo;mere</i>, or no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It pleases me well,&rdquo; she said, simply. But there was a little quiver
      about her firm-set mouth, and her aged head was bent over the primroses.
      She had foreseen it; she was glad of it; and yet for the instant it was a
      pang to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very thankful,&rdquo; said Bernadou, with a flash of joy on his face. He
      was independent of his grandmother; he could make enough to marry upon by
      his daily toil, and he had a little store of gold and silver in his bank
      in the thatch, put by for a rainy day; but he would have no more thought
      of going against her will than he would have thought of lifting his hand
      against her. In the primitive homesteads of the Berceau de Dieu filial
      reverence was still accounted the first of virtues, yet the simplest and
      the most imperative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go see Margot this evening,&rdquo; said Reine Allix, after a little
      pause. &ldquo;She is a good girl and a brave, and of pure heart and fair name.
      You have chosen well, my grandson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadou stooped his tall, fair, curly head, and she laid her hands on him
      and blessed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, as the sun set, Reine Allix kept her word, and went to the
      young maiden who had allured the eyes and heart of Bernadou. Margot was an
      orphan; she had not a penny to her dower; she had been brought up on
      charity, and she dwelt now in the family of the largest landowner of the
      place, a miller with numerous offspring, and several head of cattle, and
      many stretches of pasture and of orchard. Margot worked for a hard master,
      living indeed as one of the family, but sharply driven all day long at all
      manner of housework and field work. Reine Allix had kept her glance on
      her, through some instinctive sense of the way that Bernadou&rsquo;s thoughts
      were turning, and she had seen much to praise, nothing to chide, in the
      young girl&rsquo;s modest, industrious, cheerful, uncomplaining life. Margot was
      very pretty, too, with the brown oval face and the great black soft eyes
      and the beautiful form of the Southern blood that had run in the veins of
      her father, who had been a sailor of Marseilles, while her mother had been
      a native of the Provencal country. Altogether, Reine Allix knew that her
      beloved one could not have done better or more wisely, if choose at all he
      must. &ldquo;Some people, indeed,&rdquo; she said to herself as she climbed the street
      whose sharp-set flints had been trodden by her wooden shoes for ninety
      years&mdash;&ldquo;Some people would mourn and scold because there is no store
      of linen, no piece of silver plate, no little round sum in money with the
      poor child. But what does it matter? We have enough for three. It is
      wicked indeed for parents to live so that they leave their daughter
      portionless, but it is no fault of the child&rsquo;s. Let them say what they
      like, it is a reason the more that she should want a roof over her head
      and a husband to care for her good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she climbed the steep way and the slanting road round the hill, and
      went in by the door of the mill-house, and found Margot busy in washing
      some spring lettuces and other green things in a bowl of bright water.
      Reine Allix, in the fashion of her country and her breeding, was about to
      confer with the master and mistress ere saying a word to the girl, but
      there was that in Margot&rsquo;s face and in her timid greeting that lured
      speech out of her. She looked long and keenly into the child&rsquo;s downcast
      countenance, then touched her with a tender smile. &ldquo;Petite Margot, the
      birds told me a little secret to-day. Canst guess what it is? Say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margot coloured and then grew pale. True, Bernadou had never really spoken
      to her, but still, when one is seventeen, and has danced a few times with
      the same person, and has plucked the leaves of a daisy away to learn one&rsquo;s
      fortune, spoken words are not very much wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of her the eyes of the old woman moistened and grew dimmer than
      age had made them; she smiled still, but the smile had the sweetness of a
      blessing in it, and no longer the kindly banter of humour. &ldquo;You love him,
      my little one?&rdquo; she said, in a soft, hushed voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, madame!&rdquo; Margot could not say more. She covered her face with her
      hands, and turned to the wall, and wept with a passion of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down in the Berceau there were gossips who would have said, with wise
      shakes of their heads, &ldquo;Tut, tut! how easy it is to make believe in a
      little love when one is a serving-maid, and has not a sou, nor a roof, nor
      a friend in the world, and a comely youth well-to-do is willing to marry
      us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Reine Allix knew better. She had not lived ninety years in the world
      not to be able to discern between true feeling and counterfeit. She was
      touched, and drew the trembling frame of Margot into her arms, and kissed
      her twice on the closed, blue-veined lids of her black eyes. &ldquo;Make him
      happy, only make him happy,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;for I am very old, Margot, and
      he is alone, all alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the child crept to her, sobbing for very rapture that she, friendless,
      homeless, and penniless, should be thus elected for so fair a fate, and
      whispered through her tears, &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reine Allix spoke in all form to the miller and his wife, and with as much
      earnestness in her demand as though she had been seeking the hand of rich
      Yacobe, the tavern-keeper&rsquo;s only daughter. The people assented; they had
      no pretext to oppose; and Reine Allix wrapped her cloak about her and
      descended the hill and the street just as the twilight closed in and the
      little lights began to glimmer through the lattices and the shutters and
      the green mantle of the boughs, while the red fires of the smithy forge
      glowed brightly in the gloom, and a white horse waited to be shod, a boy
      in a blue blouse seated on its back and switching away with a branch of
      budding hazel the first gray gnats of the early year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well done, it is well done,&rdquo; she said to herself, looking at the
      low rosy clouds and the pale gold of the waning sky. &ldquo;A year or two, and I
      shall be in my grave. I shall leave him easier if I know he has some
      creature to care for him, and I shall be quiet in my coffin, knowing that
      his children&rsquo;s children will live on and on and on in the Berceau, and
      sometimes perhaps think a little of me when the nights are long and they
      sit round the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went in out of the dewy air, into the little low, square room of her
      cottage, and went up to Bernadou and laid her hands on his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it well with thee, my grandson, and with thy sons&rsquo; sons after thee,&rdquo;
       she said solemnly. &ldquo;Margot will be thy wife. May thy days and hers be long
      in thy birthplace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A month later they were married. It was then May. The green nest of the
      Berceau seemed to overflow with the singing of birds and the blossoming of
      flowers. The corn-lands promised a rare harvest, and the apple orchards
      were weighed down with their red and white blossoms. The little brown
      streams in the woods brimmed over in the grass, and the air was full of
      sweet mellow sunlight, a cool fragrant breeze, a continual music of
      humming bees and soaring larks and mule-bells ringing on the roads, and
      childish laughter echoing from the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this glad springtime Bernadou and Margot were wedded, going with their
      friends one sunny morning up the winding hill-path to the little gray
      chapel whose walls were hidden in ivy, and whose sorrowful Christ looked
      down through the open porch across the blue and hazy width of the river.
      Georges, the baker, whose fiddle made merry melody at all the village
      dances, played before them tunefully; little children, with their hands
      full of wood-flowers, ran before them; his old blind poodle smelt its way
      faithfully by their footsteps; their priest led the way upward with the
      cross held erect against the light; Reine Allix walked beside them, nearly
      as firmly as she had trodden the same road seventy years before in her own
      bridal hour. In the hollow below lay the Berceau de Dieu, with its red
      gables and its thatched roofs hidden beneath leaves, and its peaceful
      pastures smiling under the serene blue skies of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were happy&mdash;ah, heaven, so happy!&mdash;and all their little
      world rejoiced with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came home and their neighbours entered with them, and ate and drank,
      and gave them good wishes and gay songs, and the old priest blessed them
      with a father&rsquo;s tenderness upon their threshold; and the fiddle of Georges
      sent gladdest dance-music flying through the open casements, across the
      road, up the hill, far away to the clouds and the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night, when the guests had departed and all was quite still within and
      without, Reine Allix sat alone at her window in the roof, thinking of
      their future and of her past, and watching the stars come out, one by
      another, above the woods. From her lattice in the eaves she saw straight
      up the village street; saw the dwellings of her lifelong neighbours, the
      slopes of the rich fields, the gleam of the broad gray water, the
      whiteness of the crucifix against the darkened skies. She saw it all&mdash;all
      so familiar, with that intimate association only possible to the peasant
      who has dwelt on one spot from birth to age. In that faint light, in those
      deep shadows, she could trace all the scene as though the brightness of
      the moon shone on it; it was all, in its homeliness and simplicity,
      intensely dear to her. In the playtime of her childhood, in the courtship
      of her youth, in the joys and woes of her wifehood and widowhood, the
      bitter pains and sweet ecstasies of her maternity, the hunger and
      privation of struggling desolate years, the contentment and serenity of
      old age&mdash;in all these her eyes had rested only on this small, quaint,
      leafy street, with its dwellings close and low, like bee-hives in a
      garden, and its pasture-lands and corn-lands, wood-girt and water-fed,
      stretching as far as the sight could reach. Every inch of its soil, every
      turn of its paths, was hallowed to her with innumerable memories; all her
      beloved dead were garnered there where the white Christ watched them; when
      her time should come, she thought, she would rest with them nothing loath.
      As she looked, the tears of thanksgiving rolled down her withered cheeks,
      and she bent her feeble limbs and knelt down in the moonlight, praising
      God that He had given her to live and die in this cherished home, and
      beseeching Him for her children that they likewise might dwell in honesty,
      and with length of days abide beneath that roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God is good,&rdquo; she murmured, as she stretched herself to sleep beneath the
      eaves,&mdash;&ldquo;God is good. Maybe, when He takes me to Himself, if I be
      worthy, He will tell His holy saints to give me a little corner in His
      kingdom, that He shall fashion for me in the likeness of the Berceau.&rdquo; For
      it seemed to her that, than the Berceau, heaven itself could hold no
      sweeter or fairer nook of Paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The year rolled on, and the cottage under the sycamores was but the
      happier for its new inmate. Bernadou was serious of temper, though so
      gentle, and the arch, gay humour of his young wife was like perpetual
      sunlight in the house. Margot, too, was so docile, so eager, so bright,
      and so imbued with devotional reverence for her husband and his home, that
      Reine Allix day by day blessed the fate that had brought to her this
      fatherless and penniless child. Bernadou himself spoke little; words were
      not in his way; but his blue, frank eyes shone with an unclouded radiance
      that never changed, and his voice, when he did speak, had a mellow
      softness in it that made his slightest speech to the two women with him
      tender as a caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art a happy woman, my sister,&rdquo; said the priest, who was well-nigh as
      old as herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine Allix bowed her head and made the sign of the cross. &ldquo;I am, praise
      be to God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And being happy, she went to the hovel of poor Madelon Dreux, the
      cobbler&rsquo;s widow, and nursed her and her children through a malignant
      fever, sitting early and late, and leaving her own peaceful hearth for the
      desolate hut with the delirious ravings and heartrending moans of the
      fever-stricken. &ldquo;How ought one to dare to be happy if one is not of use?&rdquo;
       she would say to those who sought to dissuade her from running such peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madelon Dreux and her family recovered, owing to her their lives; and she
      was happier than before, thinking of them when she sat on the settle
      before the wood fire roasting chestnuts and spinning flax on the wheel,
      and ever and again watching the flame reflected on the fair head of
      Bernadou or in the dark, smiling eyes of Margot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another spring passed and another year went by, and the little home under
      the sycamores was still no less honest in its labours or bright in its
      rest. It was one among a million of such homes in France, where a sunny
      temper made mirth with a meal of herbs, and filial love touched to poetry
      the prose of daily household tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A child was born to Margot in the springtime with the violets and daisies,
      and Reine Allix was proud of the fourth generation, and, as she caressed
      the boy&rsquo;s healthy, fair limbs, thought that God was indeed good to her,
      and that her race would live long in the place of her birth. The child
      resembled Bernadou, and had his clear, candid eyes. It soon learned to
      know the voice of &ldquo;<i>gran&rsquo;mere</i>,&rdquo; and would turn from its young
      mother&rsquo;s bosom to stretch its arms to Reine Allix. It grew fair and
      strong, and all the ensuing winter passed its hours curled like a dormouse
      or playing like a puppy at her feet in the chimney-corner. Another spring
      and summer came, and the boy was more than a year old, with curls of gold,
      and cheeks like apples, and a mouth that always smiled. He could talk a
      little, and tumbled like a young rabbit among the flowering grasses. Reine
      Allix watched him, and her eyes filled. &ldquo;God is too good,&rdquo; she thought.
      She feared that she should scarce be so willing to go to her last sleep
      under the trees on the hillside as she used to be. She could not help a
      desire to see this child, this second Bernadou, grow up to youth and
      manhood; and of this she knew it was wild to dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was ripe midsummer. The fields were all russet and amber with an
      abundance of corn. The little gardens had seldom yielded so rich a
      produce. The cattle and the flocks were in excellent health. There had
      never been a season of greater promise and prosperity for the little
      traffic that the village and its farms drove in sending milk and sheep and
      vegetable wealth to that great city which was to it as a dim, wonderful,
      mystic name without meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening in this gracious and golden time the people sat out as usual
      when the day was done, talking from door to door, the old women knitting
      or spinning, the younger ones mending their husbands&rsquo; or brothers&rsquo; blouses
      or the little blue shirts of their infants, the children playing with the
      dogs on the sward that edged the stones of the street, and above all the
      great calm heavens and the glow of the sun that had set.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine Allix, like the others, sat before the door, for once doing nothing,
      but with folded hands and bended head dreamily taking pleasure in the
      coolness that had come with evening, and the smell of the limes that were
      in blossom, and the blithe chatter of Margot with the neighbours. Bernadou
      was close beside them, watering and weeding those flowers that were at
      once his pride and his recreation, making the face of his dwelling bright
      and the air around it full of fragrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little street was quiet in the evening light, only the laughter of the
      children and the gay gossip of their mothers breaking the pleasant
      stillness; it had been thus at evening with the Berceau centuries before
      their time; they thought that it would thus likewise be when the centuries
      should have seen the youngest-born there in his grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly came along the road between the trees an old man and a mule; it
      was Mathurin, the miller, who had been that day to a little town four
      leagues off, which was the trade-mart and the corn-exchange of the
      district. He paused before the cottage of Reine Allix; he was dusty,
      travel-stained, and sad. Margot ceased laughing among her flowers as she
      saw her old master. None of them knew why, yet the sight of him made the
      air seem cold and the night seem near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is terrible news,&rdquo; he said, drawing a sheet of printed words from
      his coat-pocket&mdash;&ldquo;terrible news! We are to go to war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;War!&rdquo; The whole village clustered round him. They had heard of war,
      far-off wars in Africa and Mexico, and some of their sons had been taken
      off like young wheat mown before its time; but it still remained to them a
      thing remote, impersonal, inconceivable, with which they had nothing to
      do, nor ever would have anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read!&rdquo; said the old man, stretching out his sheet. The only one there who
      could do so, Picot, the tailor, took it and spelled the news out to their
      wondering ears. It was the declaration of France against Prussia.
    </p>
    <p>
      There arose a great wail from the mothers whose sons were conscripts. The
      rest asked in trembling, &ldquo;Will it touch us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Us!&rdquo; echoed Picot, the tailor, in contempt. &ldquo;How should it touch us? Our
      braves will be in Berlin with another fortnight. The paper says so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The people were silent; they were not sure what he meant by Berlin, and
      they were afraid to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy! my boy!&rdquo; wailed one woman, smiting her breast. Her son was in the
      army.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marengo!&rdquo; murmured Reine Allix, thinking of that far-off time in her dim
      youth when the horseman had flown through the dusky street and the bonfire
      had blazed on the highest hill above the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bread will be dear,&rdquo; muttered Mathurin, the miller, going onward with his
      foot-weary mule. Bernadou stood silent, with his roses dry and thirsty
      round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why art thou sad?&rdquo; whispered Margot, with wistful eyes. &ldquo;Thou art exempt
      from war service, my love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadou shook his head. &ldquo;The poor will suffer somehow,&rdquo; was all he
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet to him, as to all the Berceau, the news was not very terrible, because
      it was so vague and distant&mdash;an evil so far off and shapeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Picot, the tailor, who alone could read, ran from house to house,
      from group to group, breathless, gay, and triumphant, telling them all
      that in two weeks more their brethren would sup in the king&rsquo;s palace at
      Berlin; and the people believed and laughed and chattered, and, standing
      outside their doors in the cool nights, thought that some good had come to
      them and theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Reine Allix looked up to the hill above the river and murmured, &ldquo;When
      we lit the bonfire there, Claudis lay dead;&rdquo; and Bernadou, standing musing
      among his roses, said, with a smile that was very grave, &ldquo;Margot, see
      here! When Picot shouted, &lsquo;<i>A Berlin!</i>&rsquo; he trod on my Gloire de Dijon
      rose and killed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sultry heats and cloudless nights of the wondrous and awful summer of
      the year 1870 passed by, and to the Berceau de Dieu it was a summer of
      fair promise and noble harvest, and never had the land brought forth in
      richer profusion for man and beast. Some of the youngest and ablest-bodied
      labourers were indeed drawn away to join those swift trains that hurried
      thousands and tens of thousands to the frontier by the Rhine. But most of
      the male population were married, and were the fathers of young children;
      and the village was only moved to a thrill of love and of honest pride to
      think how its young Louis and Jean and Andre and Valentin were gone full
      of high hope and high spirit, to come back, maybe,&mdash;who could say
      not?&mdash;with epaulets and ribbons of honour. Why they were gone they
      knew not very clearly, but their superiors affirmed that they were gone to
      make greater the greatness of France; and the folk of the Berceau believed
      it, having in a corner of their quiet hearts a certain vague, dormant, yet
      deep-rooted love, on which was written the name of their country.
    </p>
    <p>
      News came slowly and seldom to the Berceau. Unless some one of the men
      rode his mule to the little town, which was but very rarely, or unless
      some peddler came through the village with a news-sheet or so in his pack
      or rumours and tidings on his lips, nothing that was done beyond its
      fields and woods came to it. And the truth of what it heard it had no
      means of measuring or sifting. It believed what it was told, without
      questioning; and as it reaped the harvests in the rich hot sun of August,
      its peasants laboured cheerily in the simple and firm belief that mighty
      things were being done for them and theirs in the far eastern provinces by
      their great army, and that Louis and Jean and Andre and Valentin and the
      rest&mdash;though indeed no tidings had been heard of them&mdash;were safe
      and well and glorious somewhere, away where the sun rose, in the sacked
      palaces of the German king. Reine Allix alone of them was serious and
      sorrowful, she whose memories stretched back over the wide space of near a
      century.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why art thou anxious, <i>gran&rsquo;mere</i>?&rdquo; they said to her. &ldquo;There is no
      cause. Our army is victorious everywhere; and they say our lads will send
      us all the Prussians&rsquo; corn and cattle, so that the very beggars will have
      their stomachs full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Reine Allix shook her head, sitting knitting in the sun. &ldquo;My children,
      I remember the days of my youth. Our army was victorious then; at least,
      they said so. Well, all I know is that little Claudis and the boys with
      him never came back; and as for bread, you could not get it for love or
      money, and the people lay dead of famine out on the public roads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is so long ago, <i>gran&rsquo;mere</i>!&rdquo; they urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine Allix nodded. &ldquo;Yes, it is long ago, my dears. But I do not think
      that things change very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were silent out of respect for her, but among themselves they said,
      &ldquo;She is very old. Nothing is as it was in her time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One evening, when the sun was setting red over the reapen fields, two
      riders on trembling and sinking horses went through the village using whip
      and spur, and scarcely drew rein as they shouted to the cottagers to know
      whether they had seen go by a man running for his life. The people replied
      that they had seen nothing of the kind, and the horsemen pressed on,
      jamming their spurs into their poor beasts&rsquo; steaming flanks. &ldquo;If you see
      him, catch and hang him,&rdquo; they shouted, as they scoured away; &ldquo;he is a
      Prussian spy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Prussian!&rdquo; the villagers echoed, with a stupid stare&mdash;&ldquo;a Prussian
      in France!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of the riders looked over his shoulder for a moment. &ldquo;You fools! do
      you not know? We are beaten,&mdash;beaten everywhere,&mdash;and the
      Prussian pigs march on Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The spy was not seen in the Berceau, but the news brought by his pursuers
      scared sleep from the eyes of every grown man that night in the little
      village. &ldquo;It is the accursed Empire!&rdquo; screamed the patriots of the
      wine-shop. But the rest of the people were too terrified and down-stricken
      to take heed of empires or patriots; they only thought of Louis and Jean
      and Andre and Valentin; and they collected round Reine Allix, who said to
      them, &ldquo;My children, for love of money all our fairest fruits and flowers&mdash;yea,
      even to the best blossoms of our maidenhood&mdash;were sent to be bought
      and sold in Paris. We sinned therein, and this is the will of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was all for a time that they heard. It was a place lowly and obscure
      enough to be left in peace. The law pounced down on it once or twice and
      carried off a few more of its men for army service, and arms were sent to
      it from its neighbouring town, and an old soldier of the First Empire
      tried to instruct its remaining sons in their use. But he had no apt pupil
      except Bernadou, who soon learned to handle a musket with skill and with
      precision, and who carried his straight form gallantly and well, though
      his words were seldom heard and his eyes were always sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not be called till the last, Bernadou,&rdquo; said the old soldier;
      &ldquo;you are married, and maintain your grandam and wife and child. But a
      strong, muscular, well-built youth like you should not wait to be called;
      you should volunteer to serve France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will serve France when my time comes,&rdquo; said Bernadou, simply, in
      answer. But he would not leave his fields barren, and his orchard uncared
      for, and his wife to sicken and starve, and his grandmother to perish
      alone in her ninety-third year. They jeered and flouted and upbraided him,
      those patriots who screamed against the fallen Empire in the wine-shop;
      but he looked them straight in the eyes, and held his peace, and did his
      daily work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he is called, he will not be found wanting,&rdquo; said Reine Allix, who
      knew him better than did even the young wife whom he loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernadou clung to his home with a dogged devotion. He would not go from it
      to fight unless compelled, but for it he would have fought like a lion.
      His love for his country was only an indefinite, shadowy existence that
      was not clear to him; he could not save a land that he had never seen, a
      capital that was only to him as an empty name; nor could he comprehend the
      danger that his nation ran, nor could he desire to go forth and spend his
      life-blood in defence of things unknown to him. He was only a peasant, and
      he could not read nor greatly understand. But affection for his birthplace
      was a passion with him, mute indeed, but deep-seated as an oak. For his
      birthplace he would have struggled as a man can only struggle when supreme
      love as well as duty nerves his arm. Neither he nor Reine Allix could see
      that a man&rsquo;s duty might lie from home, but in that home both were alike
      ready to dare anything and to suffer everything. It was a narrow form of
      patriotism, yet it had nobleness, endurance, and patience in it; in song
      it has been oftentimes deified as heroism, but in modern warfare it is
      punished as the blackest crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Bernadou tarried in his cottage till he should be called, keeping watch
      by night over the safety of his village, and by day doing all he could to
      aid the deserted wives and mothers of the place by the tilling of their
      ground for them and the tending of such poor cattle as were left in their
      desolate fields. He and Margot and Reine Allix, between them, fed many
      mouths that would otherwise have been closed in death by famine, and
      denied themselves all except the barest and most meagre subsistence, that
      they might give away the little they possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all this while the war went on, but seemed far from them, so seldom
      did any tidings of it pierce the seclusion in which they dwelt. By-and-by,
      as the autumn went on, they learned a little more. Fugitives coming to the
      smithy for a horse&rsquo;s shoe; women fleeing to their old village homes from
      their base, gay life in the city; mandates from the government of defence
      sent to every hamlet in the country; stray news-sheets brought in by
      carriers or hawkers and hucksters&mdash;all these by degrees told them of
      the peril of their country, vaguely indeed, and seldom truthfully, but so
      that by mutilated rumours they came at last to know the awful facts of the
      fate of Sedan, the fall of the Empire, the siege of Paris. It did not
      alter their daily lives; it was still too far off and too impalpable. But
      a foreboding, a dread, an unspeakable woe settled down on them. Already
      their lands and cattle had been harassed to yield provision for the army
      and large towns; already their best horses had been taken for the
      siege-trains and the forage-waggons; already their ploughshares were
      perforce idle, and their children cried because of the scarcity of
      nourishment; already the iron of war had entered their souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little street at evening was mournful and very silent; the few who
      talked spoke in whispers, lest a spy should hear them, and the young ones
      had no strength to play&mdash;they wanted food.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as it was in my youth,&rdquo; said Reine Allix, eating her piece of black
      bread and putting aside the better food prepared for her, that she might
      save it, unseen, for the &ldquo;child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was horrible to her and to all of them to live in that continual terror
      of an unknown foe, that perpetual expectation of some ghastly, shapeless
      misery. They were quiet,&mdash;so quiet!&mdash;but by all they heard they
      knew that any night, as they went to their beds, the thunder of cannon
      might awaken them; any morning, as they looked on their beloved fields,
      they knew that ere sunset the flames of war might have devoured them. They
      knew so little too; all they were told was so indefinite and garbled that
      sometimes they thought the whole was some horrid dream&mdash;thought so,
      at least, until they looked at their empty stables, their untilled land,
      their children who cried from hunger, their mothers who wept for the
      conscripts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as yet it was not so very much worse than it had been in times of bad
      harvest and of dire distress; and the storm which raged over the land had
      as yet spared this little green nest among the woods on the Seine.
    </p>
    <p>
      November came. &ldquo;It is a cold night, Bernadou; put on some more wood,&rdquo; said
      Reine Allix. Fuel at the least was plentiful in that district, and
      Bernadou obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat at the table, working at a new churn for his wife; he had some
      skill at turnery and at invention in such matters. The child slept soundly
      in its cradle by the hearth, smiling while it dreamed. Margot spun at her
      wheel. Reine Allix sat by the fire, seldom lifting her head from her long
      knitting-needles, except to cast a look on her grandson or at the sleeping
      child. The little wooden shutter of the house was closed. Some winter
      roses bloomed in a pot beneath the little crucifix. Bernadou&rsquo;s flute lay
      on a shelf; he had not had heart enough to play it since the news of the
      war had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a great sobbing cry rose without&mdash;the cry of many voices,
      all raised in woe together. Bernadou rose, took his musket in his hand,
      undid his door, and looked out. All the people were turned out into the
      street, and the women, loudly lamenting, beat their breasts and strained
      their children to their bosoms. There was a sullen red light in the sky to
      the eastward, and on the wind a low, hollow roar stole to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Prussians are on us!&rdquo; answered twenty voices in one accord. &ldquo;That red
      glare is the town burning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they were all still&mdash;a stillness that was more horrible than
      their lamentations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine Allix came and stood by her grandson. &ldquo;If we must die, let us die <i>here</i>,&rdquo;
       she said, in a voice that was low and soft and grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand and kissed it. She was content with his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margot stole forth too, and crouched behind them, holding her child to her
      breast. &ldquo;What can they do to us?&rdquo; she asked, trembling, with the rich
      colours of her face blanched white.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernadou smiled on her. &ldquo;I do not know, my dear. I think even they can
      hardly bring death upon women and children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can, and they will,&rdquo; said a voice from the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      None answered. The street was very quiet in the darkness. Far away in the
      east the red glare glowed. On the wind was still that faint, distant,
      ravening roar, like the roar of famished wolves; it was the roar of fire
      and of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the silence Reine Allix spoke: &ldquo;God is good. Shall we not trust in
      Him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With one great choking sob the people answered; their hearts were
      breaking. All night long they watched in the street&mdash;they who had
      done no more to bring this curse upon them than the flower-roots that
      slept beneath the snow. They dared not go to their beds; they knew not
      when the enemy might be upon them. They dared not flee; even in their own
      woods the foe might lurk for them. One man indeed did cry aloud, &ldquo;Shall we
      stay here in our houses to be smoked out like bees from their hives? Let
      us fly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the calm, firm voice of Reine Allix rebuked him: &ldquo;Let who will, run
      like a hare from the hounds. For me and mine, we abide by our homestead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they were ashamed to be outdone by a woman, and a woman of ninety
      years old, and no man spoke any more of flight. All the night long they
      watched in the cold and the wind, the children shivering beneath their
      mothers&rsquo; skirts, the men sullenly watching the light of the flames in the
      dark, starless sky. All night long they were left alone, though far off
      they heard the dropping shots of scattered firing, and in the leafless
      woods around them the swift flight of woodland beasts startled from their
      sleep, and the hurrying feet of sheep terrified from their folds in the
      outlying fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daybreak came, gray, cheerless, very cold. A dense fog, white and raw,
      hung over the river; in the east, where the sun, they knew, was rising,
      they could only see the livid light of the still towering flames and
      pillars of black smoke against the leaden clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will let them come and go in peace if they will,&rdquo; murmured old
      Mathurin. &ldquo;What can we do? We have no arms, no powder hardly, no soldiers,
      no defence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadou said nothing, but he straightened his tall limbs, and in his
      grave blue eyes a light gleamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine Allix looked at him as she sat in the doorway of her house. &ldquo;Thy
      hands are honest, thy heart pure, thy conscience clear. Be not afraid to
      die if need there be,&rdquo; she said to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked down and smiled on her. Margot clung to him in a passion of
      weeping. He clasped her close and kissed her softly, but the woman who
      read his heart was the woman who had held him at his birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees the women crept timidly back into their houses, hiding their
      eyes so that they should not see that horrid light against the sky, while
      the starving children clung to their breasts or to their skirts, wailing
      aloud in terror. The few men there were left, for the most part of them
      very old or else mere striplings, gathered together in a hurried council.
      Old Mathurin, the miller, and the patriots of the wine-shop were agreed
      that there should be no resistance, whatever might befall them; that it
      would be best to hide such weapons as they had and any provisions that
      still remained to them, and yield up themselves and their homes with
      humble grace to the dire foe. &ldquo;If we do otherwise,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;the
      soldiers will surely slay us, and what can a miserable little hamlet like
      this achieve against cannon and steel and fire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadou alone raised his voice in opposition. His eye kindled, his cheek
      flushed, his words for once sprang from his lips like fire. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he
      said to them, &ldquo;shall we yield up our homes and our wives and our infants
      without a single blow? Shall we be so vile as to truckle to the enemies of
      France and show that we can fear them? It were a shame, a foul shame; we
      were not worthy of the name of men. Let us prove to them that there are
      people in France who are not afraid to die. Let us hold our own so long as
      we can. Our muskets are good, our walls strong, our woods in this weather
      morasses that will suck in and swallow them if only we have tact to drive
      them there. Let us do what we can. The camp of the francs-tireurs is but
      three leagues form us. They will be certain to come to our aid. At any
      rate, let us die bravely. We can do little, that may be; but if every man
      in France does that little that he can, that little will be great enough
      to drive the invaders off the soil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mathurin and the others screamed at him and hooted. &ldquo;You are a fool!&rdquo; they
      shouted. &ldquo;You will be the undoing of us all. Do you not know that one shot
      fired, nay, only one musket found, and the enemy puts a torch to the whole
      place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Bernadou, with a dark radiance in his azure eyes. &ldquo;But then
      it is a choice between disgrace and the flames; let us only take heed to
      be clear of the first&mdash;the last must rage as God wills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But they screamed and mouthed and hissed at him: &ldquo;Oh yes! fine talk, fine
      talk! See your own roof in flames if you will; you shall not ruin ours. Do
      what you will with your own neck; keep it erect or hang by it, as you
      choose. But you have no right to give your neighbours over to death,
      whether they will or no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He strove, he pleaded, he conjured, he struggled with them half the night,
      with the salt tears running down his cheeks, and all his gentle blood
      burning with righteous wrath and loathing shame, stirred for the first
      time in all his life to a rude, simple, passionate eloquence. But they
      were not persuaded. Their few gold pieces hidden in the rafters, their few
      feeble sheep starving in the folds, their own miserable lives, all hungry,
      woe-begone, and spent in daily terrors&mdash;these were still dear to
      them, and they would not imperil them. They called him a madman; they
      denounced him as one who would be their murderer; they threw themselves on
      him and demanded his musket, to bury it with the rest under the altar in
      the old chapel on the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernadou&rsquo;s eyes flashed fire; his breast heaved; his nerves quivered; he
      shook them off and strode a step forward. &ldquo;As you live,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I
      have a mind to fire on you, rather than let you live to shame yourselves
      and me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reine Allix, who stood by him silent all the while, laid her hand on his
      shoulder. &ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; she said in his ear, &ldquo;you are right, and they are
      wrong. Yet let not dissension between brethren open the door for the enemy
      to enter thereby into your homes. Do what you will with your own life,
      Bernadou,&mdash;it is yours,&mdash;but leave them to do as they will with
      theirs. You cannot make sheep into lions, and let not the first blood shed
      here be a brother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadou&rsquo;s head dropped on his breast. &ldquo;Do as you will,&rdquo; he muttered to
      his neighbours. They took his musket from him, and in the darkness of the
      night stole silently up the wooded chapel hill and buried it, with all
      their other arms, under the altar where the white Christ hung. &ldquo;We are
      safe now,&rdquo; said Mathurin, the miller, to the patriots of the tavern. &ldquo;Had
      that madman had his way, he had destroyed us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reine Allix softly led her grandson across his own threshold, and drew his
      head down to hers, and kissed him between the eyes. &ldquo;You did what you
      could, Bernadou,&rdquo; she said to him; &ldquo;let the rest come as it will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she turned from him, and flung her cloak over her head, and sank
      down, weeping bitterly; for she had lived through ninety-three years only
      to see this agony at the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernadou, now that all means of defence was gone from him, and the only
      thing left to him to deal with was his own life, had become quiet and
      silent and passionless, as was his habit. He would have fought like a
      mastiff for his home, but this they had forbidden him to do, and he was
      passive and without hope. He shut to his door, and sat down with his hand
      in that of Reine Allix and his arm around his wife. &ldquo;There is nothing to
      do but to wait,&rdquo; he said, sadly. The day seemed very long in coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      The firing ceased for a while; then its roll commenced afresh, and grew
      nearer to the village. Then again all was still.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon a shepherd staggered into the place, pale, bleeding, bruised,
      covered with mire. The Prussians, he told them, had forced him to be their
      guide, had knotted him tight to a trooper&rsquo;s saddle, and had dragged him
      with them until he was half dead with fatigue and pain. At night he had
      broken from them and had fled. They were close at hand, he said, and had
      burned the town from end to end because a man had fired at them from a
      housetop. That was all he knew. Bernadou, who had gone out to hear his
      news, returned into the house and sat down and hid his face within his
      hands. &ldquo;If I resist you are all lost,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;And yet to yield like
      a cur!&rdquo; It was a piteous question, whether to follow the instinct in him
      and see his birthplace in flames and his family slaughtered for his act,
      or to crush out the manhood in him and live, loathing himself as a coward
      for evermore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine Allix looked at him, and laid her hand on his bowed head, and her
      voice was strong and tender as music: &ldquo;Fret not thyself, my beloved. When
      the moment comes, then do as thine own heart and the whisper of God in it
      bid thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A great sob answered her; it was the first since his earliest infancy that
      she had ever heard from Bernadou.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grew dark. The autumn day died. The sullen clouds dropped scattered
      rain. The red leaves were blown in millions by the wind. The little houses
      on either side the road were dark, for the dwellers in them dared not show
      any light that might be a star to allure to them the footsteps of their
      foes. Bernadou sat with his arms on the table, and his head resting on
      them. Margot nursed her son. Reine Allix prayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly in the street without there was the sound of many feet of horses
      and of men, the shouting of angry voices, the splashing of quick steps in
      the watery ways, the screams of women, the flash of steel through the
      gloom. Bernadou sprang to his feet, his face pale, his blue eyes dark as
      night. &ldquo;They are come!&rdquo; he said, under his breath. It was not fear that he
      felt, nor horror; it was rather a passion of love for his birthplace and
      his nation&mdash;a passion of longing to struggle and to die for both. And
      he had no weapon!
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew his house-door open with a steady hand, and stood on his own
      threshold and faced these his enemies. The street was full of them, some
      mounted, some on foot; crowds of them swarmed in the woods and on the
      roads. They had settled on the village as vultures on a dead lamb&rsquo;s body.
      It was a little, lowly place; it might well have been left in peace. It
      had had no more share in the war than a child still unborn, but it came in
      the victors&rsquo; way, and their mailed heel crushed it as they passed. They
      had heard that arms were hidden and francs-tireurs sheltered there, and
      they had swooped down on it and held it hard and fast. Some were told off
      to search the chapel; some to ransack the dwellings; some to seize such
      food and bring such cattle as there might be left; some to seek out the
      devious paths that crossed and recrossed the fields; and yet there
      remained in the little street hundreds of armed men, force enough to awe a
      citadel or storm a breach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people did not attempt to resist. They stood passive, dry-eyed in
      misery, looking on while the little treasures of their household lives
      were swept away for ever, and ignorant what fate by fire or iron might be
      their portion ere the night was done. They saw the corn that was their
      winter store to save their offspring from famine poured out like
      ditch-water. They saw oats and wheat flung down to be trodden into a
      slough of mud and filth. They saw the walnut presses in their kitchens
      broken open, and their old heirlooms of silver, centuries old, borne away
      as booty. They saw the oak cupboards in their wives&rsquo; bed-chambers
      ransacked, and the homespun linen and the quaint bits of plate that had
      formed their nuptial dowers cast aside in derision or trampled into a
      battered heap. They saw the pet lamb of their infants, the silver
      ear-rings of their brides, the brave tankards they had drunk their
      marriage wine in, the tame bird that flew to their whistle, all seized for
      food or seized for spoil. They saw all this, and had to stand by with mute
      tongues and passive hands, lest any glance of wrath or gesture of revenge
      should bring the leaden bullet in their children&rsquo;s throats or the yellow
      flame amid their homesteads. Greater agony the world cannot hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the porch of the cottage, by the sycamores, one group stood and
      looked, silent and very still: Bernadou, erect, pale, calm, with a fierce
      scorn burning in his eyes; Margot, quiet because he wished her so, holding
      to her the rosy and golden beauty of her son; Reine Allix, with a patient
      horror on her face, her figure drawn to its full height, and her hands
      holding to her breast the crucifix. They stood thus, waiting they knew not
      what, only resolute to show no cowardice and meet no shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind them was the dull, waning glow of the wood fire on the hearth which
      had been the centre of all their hopes and joys; before them the dim, dark
      country, and the woe-stricken faces of their neighbours, and the moving
      soldiery with their torches, and the quivering forms of the half-dying
      horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a voice arose from the armed mass: &ldquo;Bring me the peasant hither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadou was seized by several hands and forced and dragged from his door
      out to the place where the leader of the uhlans sat on a white charger
      that shook and snorted blood in its exhaustion. Bernadou cast off the
      alien grasp that held him, and stood erect before his foes. He was no
      longer pale, and his eyes were clear and steadfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look less a fool than the rest,&rdquo; said the Prussian commander. &ldquo;You
      know this country well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; The country in whose fields and woodlands he had wandered from his
      infancy, and whose every meadow-path and wayside tree and flower-sown
      brook he knew by heart as a lover knows the lines of his mistress&rsquo;s face!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have arms here?&rdquo; pursued the German.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had had my way, you would not need ask. You would have felt them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prussian looked at him keenly, doing homage to the boldness of the
      answer. &ldquo;Will you confess where they are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the penalty for concealment of arms is death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made it so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have, and Prussian will is French law. You are a bold man; you merit
      death. But still, you know the country well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadou smiled, as a mother might smile were any foolish enough to ask
      her if she remembered the look her dead child&rsquo;s face had worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you know it well,&rdquo; pursued the Prussian, &ldquo;I will give you a chance.
      Lay hold of my stirrup-leather and be lashed to it, and show me straight
      as the crow flies to where the weapons are hidden. If you do, I will leave
      you your life. If you do not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I do not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadou was silent; his eyes glanced through the mass of soldiers to the
      little cottage under the trees opposite. The two there were straining to
      behold him, but the soldiers pushed them back, so that in the flare of the
      torches they could not see, nor in the tumult hear. He thanked God for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your choice?&rdquo; asked the uhlan, impatiently, after a moment&rsquo;s pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernadou&rsquo;s lips were white, but they did not tremble as he answered, &ldquo;I am
      no traitor.&rdquo; And his eyes, as he spoke, went softly to the little porch
      where the light glowed from that hearth beside which he would never again
      sit with the creatures he loved around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The German looked at him. &ldquo;Is that a boast, or a fact?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no traitor,&rdquo; Bernadou answered, simply, once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prussian gave a sign to his troopers. There was the sharp report of a
      double shot, and Bernadou fell dead. One bullet had pierced his brain, the
      other was bedded in his lungs. The soldiers kicked aside the warm and
      quivering body. It was only a peasant killed!
    </p>
    <p>
      With a shriek that rose above the roar of the wind, and cut like steel to
      every human heart that beat there, Reine Allix forced her way through the
      throng, and fell on her knees beside him, and caught him in her arms, and
      laid his head upon her breast, where he had used to sleep his softest
      sleep in infancy and childhood. &ldquo;It is God&rsquo;s will! it is God&rsquo;s will!&rdquo; she
      muttered; and then she laughed&mdash;a laugh so terrible that the blood of
      the boldest there ran cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margot followed her and looked, and stood dry-eyed and silent; then flung
      herself and the child she carried in her arms beneath the hoof of the
      white charger. &ldquo;End your work!&rdquo; she shrieked to them. &ldquo;You have killed him&mdash;kill
      us. Have you not mercy enough for that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horse, terrified and snorting blood, plunged and trampled the ground;
      his fore foot struck the child&rsquo;s golden head and stamped its face out of
      all human likeness. Some peasants pulled Margot from the lashing hoofs;
      she was quite dead, though neither wound nor bruise was on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine Allix neither looked nor paused. With all her strength she had begun
      to drag the body of Bernadou across the threshold of his house. &ldquo;He shall
      lie at home, he shall lie at home,&rdquo; she muttered. She would not believe
      that already he was dead. With all the force of her earliest womanhood she
      lifted him, and half drew, half bore him into the house that he had loved,
      and laid him down upon the hearth, and knelt by him, caressing him as
      though he were once more a child, and saying softly, &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;&mdash;for her
      mind was gone, and she fancied that he only slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without, the tumult of the soldiery increased. They found the arms hidden
      under the altar on the hill; they seized five peasants to slay them for
      the dire offence. The men struggled, and would not go as the sheep to the
      shambles. They were shot down in the street, before the eyes of their
      children. Then the order was given to fire the place in punishment, and
      leave it to its fate. The torches were flung with a laugh on the dry
      thatched roofs; brands snatched from the house fires on the hearths were
      tossed among the dwelling-houses and the barns. The straw and timber
      flared alight like tow.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old man, her nearest neighbour, rushed to the cottage of Reine Allix
      and seized her by the arm. &ldquo;They fire the Berceau,&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;Quick!
      quick! or you will be burned alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reine Allix looked up with a smile. &ldquo;Be quiet! Do you not see! He sleeps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man shook her, implored her, strove to drag her away; in
      desperation pointed to the roof above, which was already in flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reine Allix looked. At that sight her mind cleared, and regained
      consciousness; she remembered all, she understood all; she knew that he
      was dead. &ldquo;Go in peace and save yourself,&rdquo; she said, in the old, sweet,
      strong tone of an earlier day. &ldquo;As for me, I am very old. I and my dead
      will stay together at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man fled, and left her to her choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great curled flames and the livid vapours closed around her; she never
      moved. The death was fierce, but swift, and even in death she and the one
      whom she had loved and reared were not divided. The end soon came. From
      hill to hill the Berceau de Dieu broke into flames. The village was a lake
      of fire, into which the statue of the Christ, burning and reeling, fell.
      Some few peasants, with their wives and children, fled to the woods, and
      there escaped one torture to perish more slowly of cold and famine. All
      other things perished. The rapid stream of the flame licked up all there
      was in its path. The bare trees raised their leafless branches, on fire at
      a thousand points. The stores of corn and fruit were lapped by millions of
      crimson tongues. The pigeons flew screaming from their roosts, and sank
      into the smoke. The dogs were suffocated on the thresholds they had
      guarded all their lives. The sheep ran bleating with the wool burning on
      their living bodies. The little caged birds fluttered helpless, and then
      dropped, scorched to cinders. The aged and the sick were stifled in their
      beds. All things perished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Berceau de Dieu was as one vast furnace, in which every living
      creature was caught and consumed and changed to ashes. The tide of war has
      rolled on, and left it a blackened waste, a smoking ruin, wherein not so
      much as a mouse may creep or a bird may nestle. It is gone, and its place
      can know it nevermore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevermore. But who is there to care? It was but as a leaf which the great
      storm swept away as it passed.

    <h2>
      PROLOGUE TO THE FIRST STORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before I begin, by the aid of my wife&rsquo;s patient attention and ready pen,
      to relate any of the stories which I have heard at various times from
      persons whose likenesses I have been employed to take, it will not be
      amiss if I try to secure the reader&rsquo;s interest in the following pages by
      briefly explaining how I became possessed of the narrative matter which
      they contain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of myself I have nothing to say, but that I have followed the profession
      of a travelling portrait-painter for the last fifteen years. The pursuit
      of my calling has not only led me all through England, but has taken me
      twice to Scotland and once to Ireland. In moving from district to
      district, I am never guided beforehand by any settled plan. Sometimes the
      letters of recommendation which I get from persons who are satisfied with
      the work I have done for them determine the direction in which I travel.
      Sometimes I hear of a new neighbourhood in which there is no resident
      artist of ability, and remove thither on speculation. Sometimes my friends
      among the picture-dealers say a good word on my behalf to their rich
      customers, and so pave the way for me in the large towns. Sometimes my
      prosperous and famous brother artists, hearing of small commissions which
      it is not worth their while to accept, mention my name, and procure me
      introductions to pleasant country houses. Thus I get on, now in one way
      and now in another, not winning a reputation or making a fortune, but
      happier, perhaps, on the whole, than many men who have got both the one
      and the other. So, at least, I try to think now, though I started in my
      youth with as high an ambition as the best of them. Thank God, it is not
      my business here to speak of past times and their disappointments. A
      twinge of the old hopeless heartache comes over me sometimes still, when I
      think of my student days.
    </p>
    <p>
      One peculiarity of my present way of life is, that it brings me into
      contact with all sorts of characters. I almost feel, by this time, as if I
      had painted every civilised variety of the human race. Upon the whole, my
      experience of the world, rough as it has been, has not taught me to think
      unkindly of my fellow-creatures. I have certainly received such treatment
      at the hands of some of my sitters as I could not describe without
      saddening and shocking any kind-hearted reader; but, taking one year and
      one place with another, I have cause to remember with gratitude and
      respect, sometimes even with friendship and affection, a very large
      proportion of the numerous persons who have employed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the results of my experience are curious in a moral point of view.
      For example, I have found women almost uniformly less delicate in asking
      me about my terms, and less generous in remunerating me for my services,
      than men. On the other hand, men, within my knowledge, are decidedly
      vainer of their personal attractions, and more vexatiously anxious to have
      them done full justice to on canvas, than women. Taking both sexes
      together, I have found young people, for the most part, more gentle, more
      reasonable, and more considerate than old. And, summing up, in a general
      way, my experience of different ranks (which extends, let me premise, all
      the way down from peers to publicans), I have met with most of my formal
      and ungracious receptions among rich people of uncertain social standing;
      the highest classes and the lowest among my employers almost always
      contrive&mdash;in widely different ways, of course&mdash;to make me feel
      at home as soon as I enter their houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one great obstacle that I have to contend against in the practice of
      my profession is not, as some persons may imagine, the difficulty of
      making my sitters keep their heads still while I paint them, but the
      difficulty of getting them to preserve the natural look and the every-day
      peculiarities of dress and manner. People will assume an expression, will
      brush up their hair, will correct any little characteristic carelessness
      in their apparel&mdash;will, in short, when they want to have their
      likenesses taken, look as if they were sitting for their pictures. If I
      paint them under these artificial circumstances, I fail, of course, to
      present them in their habitual aspect; and my portrait, as a necessary
      consequence, disappoints everybody, the sitter always included. When we
      wish to judge of a man&rsquo;s character by his handwriting, we want his
      customary scrawl dashed off with his common workaday pen, not his best
      small text traced laboriously with the finest procurable crow-quill point.
      So it is with portrait-painting, which is, after all, nothing but a right
      reading of the externals of character recognisably presented to the view
      of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Experience, after repeated trials, has proved to me that the only way of
      getting sitters who persist in assuming a set look to resume their
      habitual expression is to lead them into talking about some subject in
      which they are greatly interested. If I can only beguile them into
      speaking earnestly, no matter on what topic, I am sure of recovering their
      natural expression; sure of seeing all the little precious every-day
      peculiarities of the man or woman peep out, one after another, quite
      unawares. The long maundering stories about nothing, the wearisome
      recitals of petty grievances, the local anecdotes unrelieved by the
      faintest suspicion of anything like general interest, which I have been
      condemned to hear, as a consequence of thawing the ice off the features of
      formal sitters by the method just described, would fill hundreds of
      volumes and promote the repose of thousands of readers. On the other hand,
      if I have suffered under the tediousness of the many, I have not been
      without my compensating gains from the wisdom and experience of the few.
      To some of my sitters I have been indebted for information which has
      enlarged my mind, to some for advice which has lightened my heart, to some
      for narratives of strange adventure which riveted my attention at the
      time, which have served to interest and amuse my fireside circle for many
      years past, and which are now, I would fain hope, destined to make kind
      friends for me among a wider audience than any that I have yet addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Singularly enough, almost all the best stories that I have heard from my
      sitters have been told by accident. I only remember two cases in which a
      story was volunteered to me; and, although I have often tried the
      experiment, I cannot call to mind even a single instance in which leading
      questions (as lawyers call them) on my part, addressed to a sitter, ever
      produced any result worth recording. Over and over again I have been
      disastrously successful in encouraging dull people to weary me. But the
      clever people who have something interesting to say seem, so far as I have
      observed them, to acknowledge no other stimulant than chance. For every
      story, excepting one, I have been indebted, in the first instance, to the
      capricious influence of the same chance. Something my sitter has seen
      about me, something I have remarked in my sitter, or in the room in which
      I take the likeness, or in the neighbourhood through which I pass on my
      way to work, has suggested the necessary association, or has started the
      right train of recollections, and then the story appeared to begin of its
      own accord. Occasionally the most casual notice, on my part, of some very
      unpromising object has smoothed the way for the relation of a long and
      interesting narrative. I first heard one of the most dramatic stories
      merely through being carelessly inquisitive to know the history of a
      stuffed poodle-dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is thus not without reason that I lay some stress on the desirableness
      of prefacing the following narrative by a brief account of the curious
      manner in which I became possessed of it. As to my capacity for repeating
      the story correctly, I can answer for it that my memory may be trusted. I
      may claim it as a merit, because it is, after all, a mechanical one, that
      I forget nothing, and that I can call long-past conversations and events
      as readily to my recollection as if they had happened but a few weeks ago.
      Of two things at least I feel tolerably certain before-hand, in meditating
      over its contents: first, that I can repeat correctly all that I have
      heard; and, secondly, that I have never missed anything worth hearing when
      my sitters were addressing me on an interesting subject. Although I cannot
      take the lead in talking while I am engaged in painting, I can listen
      while others speak, and work all the better for it.

      So much in the way of general preface to the pages for which I am about to
      ask the reader&rsquo;s attention. Let me now advance to particulars, and
      describe how I came to hear the story. I begin with it because it is the
      story that I have oftenest &ldquo;rehearsed,&rdquo; to borrow a phrase from the stage.
      Wherever I go, I am sooner or later sure to tell it. Only last night I was
      persuaded into repeating it once more by the inhabitants of the farm-house
      in which I am now staying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not many years ago, on returning from a short holiday visit to a friend
      settled in Paris, I found professional letters awaiting me at my agent&rsquo;s
      in London, which required my immediate presence in Liverpool. Without
      stopping to unpack, I proceeded by the first conveyance to my new
      destination; and, calling at the picture-dealer&rsquo;s shop where
      portrait-painting engagements were received for me, found to my great
      satisfaction that I had remunerative employment in prospect, in and about
      Liverpool, for at least two months to come. I was putting up my letters in
      high spirits, and was just leaving the picture-dealer&rsquo;s shop to look out
      for comfortable lodgings, when I was met at the door by the landlord of
      one of the largest hotels in Liverpool&mdash;an old acquaintance whom I
      had known as manager of a tavern in London in my student days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Kerby!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in great astonishment. &ldquo;What an unexpected
      meeting! the last man in the world whom I expected to see, and yet the
      very man whose services I want to make use of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! more work for me?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Are all the people in Liverpool going
      to have their portraits painted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only know of one,&rdquo; replied the landlord, &ldquo;a gentleman staying at my
      hotel, who wants a chalk drawing done of him. I was on my way here to
      inquire for any artist whom our picture-dealing friend could recommend.
      How glad I am that I met you before I had committed myself to employing a
      stranger!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this likeness wanted at once?&rdquo; I asked, thinking of the number of
      engagements that I had already got in my pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately&mdash;to-day&mdash;this very hour, if possible,&rdquo; said the
      landlord. &ldquo;Mr. Faulkner, the gentleman I am speaking of, was to have
      sailed yesterday for the Brazils from this place; but the wind shifted
      last night to the wrong quarter, and he came ashore again this morning. He
      may, of course, be detained here for some time; but he may also be called
      on board ship at half an hour&rsquo;s notice, if the wind shifts back again in
      the right direction. This uncertainty makes it a matter of importance that
      the likeness should be begun immediately. Undertake it if you possibly
      can, for Mr. Faulkner is a liberal gentleman, who is sure to give you your
      own terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I reflected for a minute or two. The portrait was only wanted in chalk,
      and would not take long; besides, I might finish it in the evening, if my
      other engagements pressed hard upon me in the daytime. Why not leave my
      luggage at the picture-dealer&rsquo;s, put off looking for lodgings till night,
      and secure the new commission boldly by going back at once with the
      landlord to the hotel? I decided on following this course almost as soon
      as the idea occurred to me; put my chalks in my pocket, and a sheet of
      drawing-paper in the first of my portfolios that came to hand; and so
      presented myself before Mr. Faulkner, ready to take his likeness,
      literally at five minutes&rsquo; notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found him a very pleasant, intelligent man, young and handsome. He had
      been a great traveller, had visited all the wonders of the East, and was
      now about to explore the wilds of the vast South American continent. Thus
      much he told me good-humouredly and unconstrainedly while I was preparing
      my drawing materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I had put him in the right light and position, and had seated
      myself opposite to him, he changed the subject of conversation, and asked
      me, a little confusedly as I thought, if it was not a customary practice
      among portrait-painters to gloss over the faults in their sitters&rsquo; faces,
      and to make as much as possible of any good points which their features
      might possess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;You have described the whole art and mystery of
      successful portrait-painting in a few words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I beg, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you will depart from the usual practice
      in my case, and draw me with all my defects, exactly as I am? The fact
      is,&rdquo; he went on, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;the likeness you are now
      preparing to take is intended for my mother; my roving disposition makes
      me a great anxiety to her, and she parted from me this last time very
      sadly and unwillingly. I don&rsquo;t know how the idea came into my head, but it
      struck me this morning that I could not better employ the time while I was
      delayed here on shore than by getting my likeness done to send to her as a
      keepsake. She has no portrait of me since I was a child, and she is sure
      to value a drawing of me more than anything else I could send to her. I
      only trouble you with this explanation to prove that I am really sincere
      in my wish to be drawn unflatteringly, exactly as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Secretly respecting and admiring him for what he had just said, I promised
      that his directions should be implicitly followed, and began to work
      immediately. Before I had pursued my occupation for ten minutes, the
      conversation began to flag, and the usual obstacle to my success with a
      sitter gradually set itself up between us. Quite unconsciously, of course,
      Mr. Faulkner stiffened his neck, shut his mouth, and contracted his
      eyebrows&mdash;evidently under the impression that he was facilitating the
      process of taking his portrait by making his face as like a lifeless mask
      as possible. All traces of his natural animated expression were fast
      disappearing, and he was beginning to change into a heavy and rather
      melancholy-looking man.
    </p>
    <p>
      This complete alteration was of no great consequence so long as I was only
      engaged in drawing the outline of his face and the general form of his
      features. I accordingly worked on doggedly for more than an hour; then
      left off to point my chalks again, and to give my sitter a few minutes&rsquo; 
      rest. Thus far the likeness had not suffered through Mr. Faulkner&rsquo;s
      unfortunate notion of the right way of sitting for his portrait; but the
      time of difficulty, as I well knew, was to come. It was impossible for me
      to think of putting any expression into the drawing unless I could
      contrive some means, when he resumed his chair, of making him look like
      himself again. &ldquo;I will talk to him about foreign parts,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;and
      try if I can&rsquo;t make him forget that he is sitting for his picture in that
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While I was pointing my chalks, Mr. Faulkner was walking up and down the
      room. He chanced to see the portfolio I had brought with me leaning
      against the wall, and asked if there were any sketches in it. I told him
      there were a few which I had made during my recent stay in Paris. &ldquo;In
      Paris?&rdquo; he repeated, with a look of interest; &ldquo;may I see them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave him the permission he asked as a matter of course. Sitting down, he
      took the portfolio on his knee, and began to look through it. He turned
      over the first five sketches rapidly enough; but when he came to the sixth
      I saw his face flush directly, and observed that he took the drawing out
      of the portfolio, carried it to the window, and remained silently absorbed
      in the contemplation of it for full five minutes. After that he turned
      round to me, and asked very anxiously if I had any objection to parting
      with that sketch.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the least interesting drawing of the collection&mdash;merely a view
      in one of the streets running by the backs of the houses in the Palais
      Royal. Some four or five of these houses were comprised in the view, which
      was of no particular use to me in any way, and which was too valueless, as
      a work of art, for me to think of selling it. I begged his acceptance of
      it at once. He thanked me quite warmly; and then, seeing that I looked a
      little surprised at the odd selection he had made from my sketches,
      laughingly asked me if I could guess why he had been so anxious to become
      possessed of the view which I had given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;there is some remarkable historical association
      connected with that street at the back of the Palais Royal, of which I am
      ignorant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Faulkner; &ldquo;at least none that <i>I</i> know of. The only
      association connected with the place in <i>my</i> mind is a purely
      personal association. Look at this house in your drawing&mdash;the house
      with the water-pipe running down it from top to bottom. I once passed a
      night there&mdash;a night I shall never forget to the day of my death. I
      have had some awkward travelling adventures in my time; but <i>that</i>
      adventure! Well, never mind, suppose we begin the sitting. I make but a
      bad return for your kindness in giving me the sketch by thus wasting your
      time in mere talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! come!&rdquo; thought I, as he went back to the sitter&rsquo;s chair, &ldquo;I shall
      see your natural expression on your face if I can only get you to talk
      about that adventure.&rdquo; It was easy enough to lead him in the right
      direction. At the first hint from me, he returned to the subject of the
      house in the back street. Without, I hope, showing any undue curiosity, I
      contrived to let him see that I felt a deep interest in everything he now
      said. After two or three preliminary hesitations, he at last, to my great
      joy, fairly started on the narrative of his adventure. In the interest of
      his subject he soon completely forgot that he was sitting for his
      portrait,&mdash;the very expression that I wanted came over his face,&mdash;and
      my drawing proceeded toward completion, in the right direction, and to the
      best purpose. At every fresh touch I felt more and more certain that I was
      now getting the better of my grand difficulty; and I enjoyed the
      additional gratification of having my work lightened by the recital of a
      true story, which possessed, in my estimation, all the excitement of the
      most exciting romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, as I recollect it, is how Mr. Faulkner told me his adventure.

    <h2>
      THE TRAVELLER&rsquo;S STORY OF A TERRIBLY STRANGE BED
    </h2>
    <p>
      Shortly after my education at college was finished, I happened to be
      staying at Paris with an English friend. We were both young men then, and
      lived, I am afraid, rather a wild life, in the delightful city of our
      sojourn. One night we were idling about the neighbourhood of the Palais
      Royal, doubtful to what amusement we should next betake ourselves. My
      friend proposed a visit to Frascati&rsquo;s; but his suggestion was not to my
      taste. I knew Frascati&rsquo;s, as the French saying is, by heart; had lost and
      won plenty of five-franc pieces there, merely for amusement&rsquo;s sake, until
      it was amusement no longer, and was thoroughly tired, in fact, of all the
      ghastly respectabilities of such a social anomaly as a respectable
      gambling-house. &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said I to my friend, &ldquo;let us go
      somewhere where we can see a little genuine, blackguard, poverty-stricken
      gaming with no false gingerbread glitter thrown over it all. Let us get
      away from fashionable Frascati&rsquo;s, to a house where they don&rsquo;t mind letting
      in a man with a ragged coat, or a man with no coat, ragged or otherwise.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said my friend, &ldquo;we needn&rsquo;t go out of the Palais Royal to
      find the sort of company you want. Here&rsquo;s the place just before us; as
      blackguard a place, by all report, as you could possibly wish to see.&rdquo; In
      another minute we arrived at the door and entered the house, the back of
      which you have drawn in your sketch.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got upstairs, and had left our hats and sticks with the
      doorkeeper, we were admitted into the chief gambling-room. We did not find
      many people assembled there. But, few as the men were who looked up at us
      on our entrance, they were all types&mdash;lamentably true types&mdash;of
      their respective classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had come to see blackguards; but these men were something worse. There
      is a comic side, more or less appreciable, in all blackguardism&mdash;here
      there was nothing but tragedy&mdash;mute, weird tragedy. The quiet in the
      room was horrible. The thin, haggard, long-haired young man, whose sunken
      eyes fiercely watched the turning up of the cards, never spoke; the
      flabby, fat-faced, pimply player, who pricked his piece of pasteboard
      perseveringly, to register how often black won, and how often red&mdash;never
      spoke; the dirty, wrinkled old man, with the vulture eyes and the darned
      great-coat, who had lost his last sou, and still looked on desperately,
      after he could play no longer&mdash;never spoke. Even the voice of the
      croupier sounded as if it were strangely dulled and thickened in the
      atmosphere of the room. I had entered the place to laugh, but the
      spectacle before me was something to weep over. I soon found it necessary
      to take refuge in excitement from the depression of spirits which was fast
      stealing on me. Unfortunately I sought the nearest excitement, by going to
      the table and beginning to play. Still more unfortunately, as the event
      will show, I won&mdash;won prodigiously; won incredibly; won at such a
      rate that the regular players at the table crowded round me; and staring
      at my stakes with hungry, superstitious eyes, whispered to one another
      that the English stranger was going to break the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game was Rouge et Noir. I had played at it in every city in Europe,
      without, however, the care or the wish to study the Theory of Chances&mdash;that
      philosopher&rsquo;s stone of all gamblers! And a gambler, in the strict sense of
      the word, I had never been. I was heart-whole from the corroding passion
      for play. My gaming was a mere idle amusement. I never resorted to it by
      necessity, because I never knew what it was to want money. I never
      practised it so incessantly as to lose more than I could afford, or to
      gain more than I could coolly pocket without being thrown off my balance
      by my good luck. In short, I had hitherto frequented gambling-tables&mdash;just
      as I frequented ball-rooms and opera-houses&mdash;because they amused me,
      and because I had nothing better to do with my leisure hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on this occasion it was very different&mdash;now, for the first time
      in my life, I felt what the passion for play really was. My success first
      bewildered, and then, in the most literal meaning of the word, intoxicated
      me. Incredible as it may appear, it is nevertheless true, that I only lost
      when I attempted to estimate chances, and played according to previous
      calculation. If I left everything to luck, and staked without any care or
      consideration, I was sure to win&mdash;to win in the face of every
      recognized probability in favour of the bank. At first some of the men
      present ventured their money safely enough on my colour; but I speedily
      increased my stakes to sums which they dared not risk. One after another
      they left off playing, and breathlessly looked on at my game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, time after time, I staked higher and higher, and still won. The
      excitement in the room rose to fever pitch. The silence was interrupted by
      a deep-muttered chorus of oaths and exclamations in different languages,
      every time the gold was shovelled across to my side of the table&mdash;even
      the imperturbable croupier dashed his rake on the floor in a (French) fury
      of astonishment at my success. But one man present preserved his
      self-possession, and that man was my friend. He came to my side, and
      whispering in English, begged me to leave the place, satisfied with what I
      had already gained. I must do him the justice to say that he repeated his
      warnings and entreaties several times, and only left me and went away
      after I had rejected his advice (I was to all intents and purposes
      gambling drunk) in terms which rendered it impossible for him to address
      me again that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after he had gone, a hoarse voice behind me cried: &ldquo;Permit me, my
      dear sir&mdash;permit me to restore to their proper place two napoleons
      which you have dropped. Wonderful luck, sir! I pledge you my word of
      honour, as an old soldier, in the course of my long experience in this
      sort of thing, I never saw such luck as yours&mdash;never! Go on, sir&mdash;<i>Sacre
      mille bombes!</i> Go on boldly, and break the bank!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned round and saw, nodding and smiling at me with inveterate
      civility, a tall man, dressed in a frogged and braided surtout. If I had
      been in my senses, I should have considered him, personally, as being
      rather a suspicious specimen of an old soldier. He had goggling bloodshot
      eyes, mangy moustaches, and a broken nose. His voice betrayed a
      barrack-room intonation of the worst order, and he had the dirtiest pair
      of hands I ever saw&mdash;even in France. These little personal
      peculiarities exercised, however, no repelling influence on me. In the mad
      excitement, the reckless triumph of that moment, I was ready to
      &ldquo;fraternize&rdquo; with anybody who encouraged me in my game. I accepted the old
      soldier&rsquo;s offered pinch of snuff; clapped him on the back, and swore he
      was the honestest fellow in the world&mdash;the most glorious relic of the
      Grand Army that I had ever met with. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; cried my military friend,
      snapping his fingers in ecstasy&mdash;&ldquo;Go on, and win! Break the bank&mdash;<i>Mille
      tonnerres!</i> my gallant English comrade, break the bank!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I <i>did</i> go on&mdash;went on at such a rate, that in another
      quarter of an hour the croupier called out, &ldquo;Gentlemen, the bank has
      discontinued for to-night.&rdquo; All the notes, and all the gold in that &ldquo;bank&rdquo;
       now lay in a heap under my hands; the whole floating capital of the
      gambling-house was waiting to pour into my pockets!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tie up the money in your pocket-handkerchief, my worthy sir,&rdquo; said the
      old soldier, as I wildly plunged my hands into my heap of gold. &ldquo;Tie it
      up, as we used to tie up a bit of dinner in the Grand Army; your winnings
      are too heavy for any breeches-pockets that ever were sewed. There! that&rsquo;s
      it&mdash;shovel them in, notes and all! <i>Credie!</i> what luck! Stop!
      another napoleon on the floor! Ah! <i>sacre petit polisson de Napoleon!</i>
      have I found thee at last? Now then, sir&mdash;two tight double knots each
      way with your honourable permission, and the money&rsquo;s safe. Feel it! feel
      it, fortunate sir! hard and round as a cannon-ball&mdash;<i>Ah, bah!</i>
      if they had only fired such cannon-balls at us at Austerlitz&mdash;<i>nom
      d&rsquo;une pipe!</i> if they only had! And now, as an ancient grenadier, as an
      ex-brave of the French army, what remains for me to do? I ask what? Simply
      this: to entreat my valued English friend to drink a bottle of champagne
      with me, and toast the goddess Fortune in foaming goblets before we part!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent ex-brave! Convivial ancient grenadier! Champagne by all means!
      An English cheer for an old soldier! Hurrah! hurrah! Another English cheer
      for the goddess Fortune! Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo! the Englishman; the amiable, gracious Englishman, in whose veins
      circulates the vivacious blood of France! Another glass? <i>Ah, bah!</i>&mdash;the
      bottle is empty! Never mind! <i>Vive le vin!</i> I, the old soldier, order
      another bottle, and half a pound of bonbons with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, ex-brave; never&mdash;ancient grenadier! <i>Your</i> bottle last
      time; my bottle this. Behold it! Toast away! The French Army! the great
      Napoleon! the present company! the croupier! the honest croupier&rsquo;s wife
      and daughters&mdash;if he has any! the Ladies generally! everybody in the
      world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the time the second bottle of champagne was emptied, I felt as if I had
      been drinking liquid fire&mdash;my brain seemed all aflame. No excess in
      wine had ever had this effect on me before in my life. Was it the result
      of a stimulant acting upon my system when I was in a highly excited state?
      Was my stomach in a particularly disordered condition? Or was the
      champagne amazingly strong?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ex-brave of the French Army!&rdquo; cried I, in a mad state of exhilaration, &ldquo;I
      am on fire! how are you? You have set me on fire. Do you hear, my hero of
      Austerlitz? Let us have a third bottle of champagne to put the flame out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old soldier wagged his head, rolled his goggle-eyes, until I expected
      to see them slip out of their sockets; placed his dirty forefinger by the
      side of his broken nose; solemnly ejaculated &ldquo;Coffee!&rdquo; and immediately ran
      off into an inner room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word pronounced by the eccentric veteran seemed to have a magical
      effect on the rest of the company present. With one accord they all rose
      to depart. Probably they had expected to profit by my intoxication; but
      finding that my new friend was benevolently bent on preventing me from
      getting dead drunk, had now abandoned all hope of thriving pleasantly on
      my winnings. Whatever their motive might be, at any rate they went away in
      a body. When the old soldier returned, and sat down again opposite to me
      at the table, we had the room to ourselves. I could see the croupier, in a
      sort of vestibule which opened out of it, eating his supper in solitude.
      The silence was now deeper than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden change, too, had come over the &ldquo;ex-brave&rdquo;. He assumed a
      portentously solemn look; and when he spoke to me again, his speech was
      ornamented by no oaths, enforced by no finger-snapping, enlivened by no
      apostrophes or exclamations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, my dear sir,&rdquo; said he, in mysteriously confidential tones&mdash;&ldquo;listen
      to an old soldier&rsquo;s advice. I have been to the mistress of the house (a
      very charming woman, with a genius for cookery!) to impress on her the
      necessity of making us some particularly strong and good coffee. You must
      drink this coffee in order to get rid of your little amiable exaltation of
      spirits before you think of going home&mdash;you <i>must</i>, my good and
      gracious friend! With all that money to take home to-night, it is a sacred
      duty to yourself to have your wits about you. You are known to be a winner
      to an enormous extent by several gentlemen present to-night, who, in a
      certain point of view, are very worthy and excellent fellows; but they are
      mortal men, my dear sir, and they have their amiable weaknesses. Need I
      say more? Ah, no, no! you understand me! Now, this is what you must do&mdash;send
      for a cabriolet when you feel quite well again&mdash;draw up all the
      windows when you get into it&mdash;and tell the driver to take you home
      only through the large and well-lighted thoroughfares. Do this; and you
      and your money will be safe. Do this; and to-morrow you will thank an old
      soldier for giving you a word of honest advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just as the ex-brave ended his oration in very lachrymose tones, the
      coffee came in, ready poured out in two cups. My attentive friend handed
      me one of the cups with a bow. I was parched with thirst, and drank it off
      at a draught. Almost instantly afterwards, I was seized with a fit of
      giddiness, and felt more completely intoxicated than ever. The room
      whirled round and round furiously; the old soldier seemed to be regularly
      bobbing up and down before me like the piston of a steam-engine. I was
      half deafened by a violent singing in my ears; a feeling of utter
      bewilderment, helplessness, idiocy, overcame me. I rose from my chair,
      holding on by the table to keep my balance; and stammered out that I felt
      dreadfully unwell&mdash;so unwell that I did not know how I was to get
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; answered the old soldier&mdash;and even his voice seemed
      to be bobbing up and down as he spoke&mdash;&ldquo;my dear friend, it would be
      madness to go home in <i>your</i> state; you would be sure to lose your
      money; you might be robbed and murdered with the greatest ease. <i>I</i>
      am going to sleep here; do you sleep here, too&mdash;they make up capital
      beds in this house&mdash;take one; sleep off the effects of the wine, and
      go home safely with your winnings to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow, in broad
      daylight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had but two ideas left: one, that I must never let go hold of my
      handkerchief full of money; the other, that I must lie down somewhere
      immediately, and fall off into a comfortable sleep. So I agreed to the
      proposal about the bed, and took the offered arm of the old soldier,
      carrying my money with my disengaged hand. Preceded by the croupier, we
      passed along some passages and up a flight of stairs into the bedroom
      which I was to occupy. The ex-brave shook me warmly by the hand, proposed
      that we should breakfast together, and then, followed by the croupier,
      left me for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran to the wash-hand stand; drank some of the water in my jug; poured
      the rest out, and plunged my face into it; then sat down in a chair and
      tried to compose myself. I soon felt better. The change for my lungs, from
      the fetid atmosphere of the gambling-room to the cool air of the apartment
      I now occupied, the almost equally refreshing change for my eyes, from the
      glaring gaslights of the &ldquo;salon&rdquo; to the dim, quiet flicker of one bedroom
      candle, aided wonderfully the restorative effects of cold water. The
      giddiness left me, and I began to feel a little like a reasonable being
      again. My first thought was of the risk of sleeping all night in a
      gambling-house; my second, of the still greater risk of trying to get out
      after the house was closed, and of going home alone at night through the
      streets of Paris with a large sum of money about me. I had slept in worse
      places than this on my travels; so I determined to lock, bolt, and
      barricade my door, and take my chance till the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, I secured myself against all intrusion; looked under the bed,
      and into the cupboard; tried the fastening of the window; and then,
      satisfied that I had taken every proper precaution, pulled off my upper
      clothing, put my light, which was a dim one, on the hearth among a
      feathery litter of wood-ashes, and got into bed, with the handkerchief
      full of money under my pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I soon felt not only that I could not go to sleep, but that I could not
      even close my eyes. I was wide awake, and in a high fever. Every nerve in
      my body trembled&mdash;every one of my senses seemed to be preternaturally
      sharpened. I tossed and rolled, and tried every kind of position, and
      perseveringly sought out the cold corners of the bed, and all to no
      purpose. Now I thrust my arms over the clothes; now I poked them under the
      clothes; now I violently shot my legs straight out down to the bottom of
      the bed; now I convulsively coiled them up as near my chin as they would
      go; now I shook out my crumpled pillow, changed it to the cool side,
      patted it flat, and lay down quietly on my back; now I fiercely doubled it
      in two, set it up on end, thrust it against the board of the bed, and
      tried a sitting posture. Every effort was in vain; I groaned with vexation
      as I felt that I was in for a sleepless night.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could I do? I had no book to read. And yet, unless I found out some
      method of diverting my mind, I felt certain that I was in the condition to
      imagine all sorts of horrors; to rack my brain with forebodings of every
      possible and impossible danger; in short, to pass the night in suffering
      all conceivable varieties of nervous terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      I raised myself on my elbow, and looked about the room&mdash;which was
      brightened by a lovely moonlight pouring straight through the window&mdash;to
      see if it contained any pictures or ornaments that I could at all clearly
      distinguish. While my eyes wandered from wall to wall, a remembrance of Le
      Maistre&rsquo;s delightful little book, &ldquo;Voyage autour de ma Chambre,&rdquo; occurred
      to me. I resolved to imitate the French author, and find occupation and
      amusement enough to relieve the tedium of my wakefulness, by making a
      mental inventory of every article of furniture I could see, and by
      following up to their sources the multitude of associations which even a
      chair, a table, or a wash-hand stand may be made to call forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the nervous unsettled state of my mind at that moment, I found it much
      easier to make my inventory than to make my reflections, and thereupon
      soon gave up all hope of thinking in Le Maistre&rsquo;s fanciful track&mdash;or,
      indeed, of thinking at all. I looked about the room at the different
      articles of furniture, and did nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, first, the bed I was lying in; a four-post bed, of all things
      in the world to meet with in Paris&mdash;yes, a thoroughly clumsy British
      four-poster, with the regular top lined with chintz&mdash;the regular
      fringed valance all round&mdash;the regular stifling, unwholesome
      curtains, which I remembered having mechanically drawn back against the
      posts without particularly noticing the bed when I first got into the
      room. Then there was the marble-topped wash-hand stand, from which the
      water I had spilled, in my hurry to pour it out, was still dripping,
      slowly and more slowly, on to the brick floor. Then two small chairs, with
      my coat, waistcoat, and trousers flung on them. Then a large elbow-chair
      covered with dirty-white dimity, with my cravat and shirt collar thrown
      over the back. Then a chest of drawers with two of the brass handles off,
      and a tawdry, broken china inkstand placed on it by way of ornament for
      the top. Then the dressing-table, adorned by a very small looking-glass,
      and a very large pincushion. Then the window&mdash;an unusually large
      window. Then a dark old picture, which the feeble candle dimly showed me.
      It was a picture of a fellow in a high Spanish hat, crowned with a plume
      of towering feathers. A swarthy, sinister ruffian, looking upward, shading
      his eyes with his hand, and looking intently upward&mdash;it might be at
      some tall gallows at which he was going to be hanged. At any rate, he had
      the appearance of thoroughly deserving it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This picture put a kind of constraint upon me to look upward too&mdash;at
      the top of the bed. It was a gloomy and not an interesting object, and I
      looked back at the picture. I counted the feathers in the man&rsquo;s hat&mdash;they
      stood out in relief&mdash;three white, two green. I observed the crown of
      his hat, which was of conical shape, according to the fashion supposed to
      have been favoured by Guido Fawkes. I wondered what he was looking up at.
      It couldn&rsquo;t be at the stars; such a desperado was neither astrologer nor
      astronomer. It must be at the high gallows, and he was going to be hanged
      presently. Would the executioner come into possession of his conical
      crowned hat and plume of feathers? I counted the feathers again&mdash;three
      white, two green.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I still lingered over this very improving and intellectual
      employment, my thoughts insensibly began to wander. The moonlight shining
      into the room reminded me of a certain moonlight night in England&mdash;the
      night after a picnic party in a Welsh valley. Every incident of the drive
      homeward, through lovely scenery, which the moonlight made lovelier than
      ever, came back to my remembrance, though I had never given the picnic a
      thought for years; though, if I had <i>tried</i> to recollect it, I could
      certainly have recalled little or nothing of that scene long past. Of all
      the wonderful faculties that help to tell us we are immortal, which speaks
      the sublime truth more eloquently than memory? Here was I, in a strange
      house of the most suspicious character, in a situation of uncertainty, and
      even of peril, which might seem to make the cool exercise of my
      recollection almost out of the question; nevertheless, remembering, quite
      involuntarily, places, people, conversations, minute circumstances of
      every kind, which I had thought forgotten for ever; which I could not
      possibly have recalled at will, even under the most favourable auspices.
      And what cause had produced in a moment the whole of this strange,
      complicated, mysterious effect? Nothing but some rays of moonlight shining
      in at my bedroom window.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was still thinking of the picnic&mdash;of our merriment on the drive
      home&mdash;of the sentimental young lady who <i>would quote</i> &ldquo;Childe
      Harold&rdquo; because it was moonlight. I was absorbed by these past scenes and
      past amusements, when, in an instant, the thread on which my memories hung
      snapped asunder; my attention immediately came back to present things more
      vividly than ever, and I found myself, I neither knew why nor wherefore,
      looking hard at the picture again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking for what?
    </p>
    <p>
      Good God! the man had pulled his hat down on his brows! No! the hat itself
      was gone! Where was the conical crown? Where the feathers&mdash;three
      white, two green? Not there! In place of the hat and feathers, what dusky
      object was it that now hid his forehead, his eyes, his shading hand?
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the bed moving?
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned on my back and looked up. Was I mad? drunk? dreaming? giddy
      again? or was the top of the bed really moving down&mdash;sinking slowly,
      regularly, silently, horribly, right down throughout the whole of its
      length and breadth&mdash;right down upon me, as I lay underneath?
    </p>
    <p>
      My blood seemed to stand still. A deadly paralysing coldness stole all
      over me as I turned my head round on the pillow and determined to test
      whether the bedtop was really moving or not, by keeping my eye on the man
      in the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next look in that direction was enough. The dull, black, frowzy
      outline of the valance above me was within an inch of being parallel with
      his waist. I still looked breathlessly. And steadily and slowly&mdash;very
      slowly&mdash;I saw the figure, and the line of frame below the figure,
      vanish, as the valance moved down before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am, constitutionally, anything but timid. I have been on more than one
      occasion in peril of my life, and have not lost my self-possession for an
      instant; but when the conviction first settled on my mind that the bed-top
      was really moving, was steadily and continuously sinking down upon me, I
      looked up shuddering, helpless, panic-stricken, beneath the hideous
      machinery for murder, which was advancing closer and closer to suffocate
      me where I lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked up, motionless, speechless, breathless. The candle, fully spent,
      went out; but the moonlight still brightened the room. Down and down,
      without pausing and without sounding, came the bedtop, and still my panic
      terror seemed to bind me faster and faster to the mattress on which I lay&mdash;down
      and down it sank, till the dusty odour from the lining of the canopy came
      stealing into my nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that final moment the instinct of self-preservation startled me out of
      my trance, and I moved at last. There was just room for me to roll myself
      sideways off the bed. As I dropped noiselessly to the floor, the edge of
      the murderous canopy touched me on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without stopping to draw my breath, without wiping the cold sweat from my
      face, I rose instantly on my knees to watch the bedtop. I was literally
      spellbound by it. If I had heard footsteps behind me, I could not have
      turned round; if a means of escape had been miraculously provided for me,
      I could not have moved to take advantage of it. The whole life in me was,
      at that moment, concentrated in my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It descended&mdash;the whole canopy, with the fringe round it, came down&mdash;down&mdash;close
      down; so close that there was not room now to squeeze my finger between
      the bedtop and the bed. I felt at the sides, and discovered that what had
      appeared to me from beneath to be the ordinary light canopy of a four-post
      bed was in reality a thick, broad mattress, the substance of which was
      concealed by the valance and its fringe. I looked up and saw the four
      posts rising hideously bare. In the middle of the bedtop was a huge wooden
      screw that had evidently worked it down through a hole in the ceiling,
      just as ordinary presses are worked down on the substance selected for
      compression. The frightful apparatus moved without making the faintest
      noise. There had been no creaking as it came down; there was now not the
      faintest sound from the room above. Amid a dead and awful silence I beheld
      before me&mdash;in the nineteenth century, and in the civilized capital of
      France&mdash;such a machine for secret murder by suffocation as might have
      existed in the worst days of the Inquisition, in the lonely inns among the
      Harz Mountains, in the mysterious tribunals of Westphalia! Still, as I
      looked on it, I could not move, I could hardly breathe, but I began to
      recover the power of thinking, and in a moment I discovered the murderous
      conspiracy framed against me in all its horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      My cup of coffee had been drugged, and drugged too strongly. I had been
      saved from being smothered by having taken an overdose of some narcotic.
      How I had chafed and fretted at the fever-fit which had preserved my life
      by keeping me awake! How recklessly I had confided myself to the two
      wretches who had led me into this room, determined, for the sake of my
      winnings, to kill me in my sleep by the surest and most horrible
      contrivance for secretly accomplishing my destruction! How many men,
      winners like me, had slept, as I had proposed to sleep, in that bed, and
      had never been seen or heard of more! I shuddered at the bare idea of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, ere long, all thought was again suspended by the sight of the
      murderous canopy moving once more. After it had remained on the bed&mdash;as
      nearly as I could guess&mdash;about ten minutes, it began to move up
      again. The villains who worked it from above evidently believed that their
      purpose was now accomplished. Slowly and silently, as it had descended,
      that horrible bedtop rose towards its former place. When it reached the
      upper extremities of the four posts, it reached the ceiling, too. Neither
      hole nor screw could be seen; the bed became in appearance an ordinary bed
      again&mdash;the canopy an ordinary canopy&mdash;even to the most
      suspicious eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, for the first time, I was able to move&mdash;to rise from my knees&mdash;to
      dress myself in my upper clothing&mdash;and to consider of how I should
      escape. If I betrayed by the smallest noise that the attempt to suffocate
      me had failed, I was certain to be murdered. Had I made any noise already?
      I listened intently, looking towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      No! no footsteps in the passage outside&mdash;no sound of a tread, light
      or heavy, in the room above&mdash;absolute silence everywhere. Besides
      locking and bolting my door, I had moved an old wooden chest against it,
      which I had found under the bed. To remove this chest (my blood ran cold
      as I thought of what its contents might be!) without making some
      disturbance was impossible; and, moreover, to think of escaping through
      the house, now barred up for the night, was sheer insanity. Only one
      chance was left me&mdash;the window. I stole to it on tiptoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      My bedroom was on the first floor, above an entresol, and looked into a
      back street. I raised my hand to open the window, knowing that on that
      action hung, by the merest hairbreadth, my chance of safety. They keep
      vigilant watch in a house of murder. If any part of the frame cracked, if
      the hinge creaked, I was a lost man! It must have occupied me at least
      five minutes, reckoning by time&mdash;five <i>hours</i>, reckoning by
      suspense&mdash;to open that window. I succeeded in doing it silently&mdash;in
      doing it with all the dexterity of a house-breaker&mdash;and then looked
      down into the street. To leap the distance beneath me would be almost
      certain destruction! Next, I looked round at the sides of the house. Down
      the left side ran a thick water-pipe&mdash;it passed close by the outer
      edge of the window. The moment I saw the pipe I knew I was saved. My
      breath came and went freely for the first time since I had seen the canopy
      of the bed moving down upon me!
    </p>
    <p>
      To some men the means of escape which I had discovered might have seemed
      difficult and dangerous enough&mdash;to <i>me</i> the prospect of slipping
      down the pipe into the street did not suggest even a thought of peril. I
      had always been accustomed, by the practice of gymnastics, to keep up my
      school-boy powers as a daring and expert climber; and knew that my head,
      hands, and feet would serve me faithfully in any hazards of ascent or
      descent. I had already got one leg over the window-sill, when I remembered
      the handkerchief filled with money under my pillow. I could well have
      afforded to leave it behind me, but I was revengefully determined that the
      miscreants of the gambling-house should miss their plunder as well as
      their victim. So I went back to the bed and tied the heavy handkerchief at
      my back by my cravat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as I had made it tight and fixed it in a comfortable place, I thought
      I heard a sound of breathing outside the door. The chill feeling of horror
      ran through me again as I listened. No! dead silence still in the passage&mdash;I
      had only heard the night air blowing softly into the room. The next moment
      I was on the window-sill, and the next I had a firm grip on the water-pipe
      with my hands and knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      I slid down into the street easily and quietly, as I thought I should, and
      immediately set off at the top of my speed to a branch &ldquo;prefecture&rdquo; of
      Police, which I knew was situated in the immediate neighbourhood. A
      &ldquo;subprefect,&rdquo; and several picked men among his subordinates, happened to
      be up, maturing, I believe, some scheme for discovering the perpetrator of
      a mysterious murder which all Paris was talking of just then. When I began
      my story, in a breathless hurry and in very bad French, I could see that
      the subprefect suspected me of being a drunken Englishman who had robbed
      somebody; but he soon altered his opinion as I went on, and before I had
      anything like concluded, he shoved all the papers before him into a
      drawer, put on his hat, supplied me with another (for I was bareheaded),
      ordered a file of soldiers, desired his expert followers to get ready all
      sorts of tools for breaking open doors and ripping up brick flooring, and
      took my arm, in the most friendly and familiar manner possible, to lead me
      with him out of the house. I will venture to say that when the subprefect
      was a little boy, and was taken for the first time to the play, he was not
      half as much pleased as he was now at the job in prospect for him at the
      gambling-house!
    </p>
    <p>
      Away we went through the streets, the subprefect cross-examining and
      congratulating me in the same breath as we marched at the head of our
      formidable posse comitatus. Sentinels were placed at the back and front of
      the house the moment we got to it; a tremendous battery of knocks was
      directed against the door; a light appeared at a window; I was told to
      conceal myself behind the police; then came more knocks and a cry of &ldquo;Open
      in the name of the law!&rdquo; At that terrible summons bolts and locks gave way
      before an invisible hand, and the moment after the subprefect was in the
      passage, confronting a waiter half dressed and ghastly pale. This was the
      short dialogue which immediately took place:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want to see the Englishman who is sleeping in this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went away hours ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did no such thing. His friend went away; <i>he</i> remained. Show us
      to his bedroom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear to you, Monsieur le Sous-prefet, he is not here! he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear to you, Monsieur le Garcon, he is. He slept here; he didn&rsquo;t find
      your bed comfortable; he came to us to complain of it; here he is among my
      men; and here am I ready to look for a flea or two in his bedstead.
      Renaudin!&rdquo; (calling to one of the subordinates, and pointing to the
      waiter), &ldquo;collar that man, and tie his hands behind him. Now then,
      gentlemen, let us walk upstairs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every man and woman in the house was secured&mdash;the &ldquo;old soldier&rdquo; the
      first. Then I identified the bed in which I had slept, and then we went
      into the room above.
    </p>
    <p>
      No object that was at all extraordinary appeared in any part of it. The
      subprefect looked round the place, commanded everybody to be silent,
      stamped twice on the floor, called for a candle, looked attentively at the
      spot he had stamped on, and ordered the flooring there to be carefully
      taken up. This was done in no time. Lights were produced, and we saw a
      deep raftered cavity between the floor of this room and the ceiling of the
      room beneath. Through this cavity there ran perpendicularly a sort of case
      of iron, thickly greased; and inside the case appeared the screw, which
      communicated with the bedtop below. Extra lengths of screw, freshly oiled;
      levers covered with felt; all the complete upper works of a heavy press&mdash;constructed
      with infernal ingenuity so as to join the fixtures below, and when taken
      to pieces again to go into the smallest possible compass&mdash;were next
      discovered and pulled out on the floor. After some little difficulty the
      subprefect succeeded in putting the machinery together, and, leaving his
      men to work it, descended with me to the bedroom. The smothering canopy
      was then lowered, but not so noiselessly as I had seen it lowered. When I
      mentioned this to the subprefect, his answer, simple as it was, had a
      terrible significance. &ldquo;My men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are working down the bedtop for
      the first time; the men whose money you won were in better practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We left the house in the sole possession of two police agents, every one
      of the inmates being removed to prison on the spot. The subprefect, after
      taking down my <i>proces verbal</i> in his office, returned with me to my
      hotel to get my passport. &ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; I asked, as I gave it to him,
      &ldquo;that any men have really been smothered in that bed, as they tried to
      smother <i>me</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen dozens of drowned men laid out at the morgue,&rdquo; answered the
      subprefect, &ldquo;in whose pocket-books were found letters stating that they
      had committed suicide in the Seine, because they had lost everything at
      the gaming-table. Do I know how many of those men entered the same
      gambling-house that <i>you</i> entered? won as <i>you</i> won? took that
      bed as <i>you</i> took it? slept in it? were smothered in it? and were
      privately thrown into the river, with a letter of explanation written by
      the murderers and placed in their pocket-books? No man can say how many or
      how few have suffered the fate from which you have escaped. The people of
      the gambling-house kept their bedstead machinery a secret from <i>us</i>&mdash;even
      from the police! The dead kept the rest of the secret for them.
      Good-night, or rather good-morning, Monsieur Faulkner! Be at my office
      again at nine o&rsquo;clock; in the meantime, <i>au revoir</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest of my story is soon told. I was examined and reexamined; the
      gambling-house was strictly searched all through from top to bottom; the
      prisoners were separately interrogated, and two of the less guilty among
      them made a confession. I discovered that the old soldier was master of
      the gambling-house&mdash;<i>justice</i> discovered that he had been
      drummed out of the army as a vagabond years ago; that he had been guilty
      of all sorts of villainies since; that he was in possession of stolen
      property, which the owners identified; and that he, the croupier, another
      accomplice, and the woman who had made my cup of coffee were all in the
      secret of the bedstead. There appeared some reason to doubt whether the
      inferior persons attached to the house knew anything of the suffocating
      machinery; and they received the benefit of that doubt, by being treated
      simply as thieves and vagabonds. As for the old soldier and his two head
      myrmidons, they went to the galleys; the woman who had drugged my coffee
      was imprisoned for I forget how many years; the regular attendants at the
      gambling-house were considered &ldquo;suspicious,&rdquo; and placed under
      &ldquo;surveillance&rdquo;; and I became, for one whole week (which is a long time),
      the head &ldquo;lion&rdquo; in Parisian society. My adventure was dramatised by three
      illustrious play-makers, but never saw theatrical daylight; for the
      censorship forbade the introduction on the stage of a correct copy of the
      gambling-house bedstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      One good result was produced by my adventure, which any censorship must
      have approved: it cured me of ever again trying rouge-et-noir as an
      amusement. The sight of a green cloth, with packs of cards and heaps of
      money on it, will henceforth be for ever associated in my mind with the
      sight of a bed canopy descending to suffocate me in the silence and
      darkness of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Mr. Faulkner pronounced these words he started in his chair, and
      resumed his stiff, dignified position in a great hurry. &ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo;
       cried he, with a comic look of astonishment and vexation, &ldquo;while I have
      been telling you what is the real secret of my interest in the sketch you
      have so kindly given to me, I have altogether forgotten that I came here
      to sit for my portrait. For the last hour or more I must have been the
      worst model you ever had to draw from!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, you have been the best,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I have been trying to
      catch your likeness; and, while telling your story, you have unconsciously
      shown me the natural expression I wanted to insure my success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      NOTE BY MRS. KERBY
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot let this story end without mentioning what the chance saying was
      which caused it to be told at the farmhouse the other night. Our friend
      the young sailor, among his other quaint objections to sleeping on shore,
      declared that he particularly hated four-post beds, because he never slept
      in one without doubting whether the top might not come down in the night
      and suffocate him. I thought this chance reference to the distinguishing
      feature of William&rsquo;s narrative curious enough, and my husband agreed with
      me. But he says it is scarcely worth while to mention such a trifle in
      anything so important as a book. I cannot venture, after this, to do more
      than slip these lines in modestly at the end of the story. If the printer
      should notice my few last words, perhaps he may not mind the trouble of
      putting them into some out-of-the-way corner, in very small type.

    <h2>
      MICHEL LORIO&rsquo;S CROSS, By Hesba Stretton
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the southwest point of Normandy, separated from Brittany only by a
      narrow and straight river, like the formal canals of Holland, stands the
      curious granite rock which is called Mont St. Michel. It is an isolated
      peak, rising abruptly out of a vast plain of sand to the height of nearly
      four hundred feet, and so precipitous toward the west that scarcely a root
      of grass finds soil enough in its weather-beaten clefts. At the very
      summit is built that wonderful church, the rich architecture and flying
      buttresses of which strike the eye leagues and leagues away, either on the
      sea or the mainland. Below the church, and supporting it by a solid
      masonry, is a vast pile formerly a fortress, castle, and prison; with
      caverns and dungeons hewn out of the living rock, and vaulted halls and
      solemn crypts; all desolate and solitary now, except when a party of
      pilgrims or tourists pass through them, ushered by a guide. Still lower
      down the rock, along its eastern and southern face, there winds a dark and
      narrow street, with odd, antique houses on either side. The only
      conveyance that can pass along it is the water-cart which supplies the
      town with fresh water from the mainland. The whole place is guarded by a
      strong and high rampart, with bastions and battlemented walls; and the
      only entrance is through three gateways, one immediately behind the other,
      with a small court between. The second of these strong gateways is
      protected by two old cannon, taken from the English in 1423, and still
      pointed out to visitors with inextinguishable pride by the natives of
      Mont. St. Michel.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great plain of sand stretches around the Mont for miles every way&mdash;of
      sand or sea, for the water covers it at flood-tides, beating up against
      the foot of the granite rocks and the granite walls of the ramparts. But
      at neap tides and <i>eaux mortes</i>, as the French say, there is nothing
      but a desert of brown, bare sand, with ripple-marks lying across it, and
      with shallow, ankle-deep pools of salt water here and there. Afar off on
      the western sky-line a silver fringe of foam, glistening in the sunshine,
      marks the distant boundary to which the sea has retreated. On every other
      side of the horizon rises a belt of low cliffs, bending into a semicircle,
      with sweeping outlines of curves miles in length, drawn distinctly against
      the clear sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only way to approach the Mont is across the sands. Each time the tide
      recedes a fresh track must be made, like the track along snowy roads; and
      every traveller, whether on foot or in carriage, must direct his steps by
      this scarcely beaten path. Now and then he passes a high, strong post,
      placed where there is any dangerous spot upon the plain; for there are
      perilous quicksands, imperceptible to any eye, lurking in sullen and
      patient treachery for any unwary footstep. The river itself, which creeps
      sluggishly in a straight black line across the brown desert, has its banks
      marked out by rows of these high stakes, with a bush of leafless twigs at
      the top of each. A dreary, desolate, and barren scene it is, with no life
      in it except the isolated life upon the Mont.
    </p>
    <p>
      This little family of human beings, separated from the great tide of life
      like one of the shallow pools which the ebbing sea has left upon its
      sands, numbers scarcely a hundred and a half. The men are fishers, for
      there is no other occupation to be followed on the sterile rock. Every day
      also the level sweep of sands is wandered over by the women and children,
      who seek for cockles in the little pools; the babble of whose voices
      echoes far through the quiet air, and whose shadows fall long and unbroken
      on the brown wilderness. Now and then the black-robed figure of a priest,
      or of one of the brothers dwelling in the monument on the top of the rock,
      may be seen slowly pacing along the same dead level, and skirting the
      quicksands where the warning posts are erected. In the summer months bands
      of pilgrims are also to be seen marching in a long file like travellers
      across the desert; but in winter these visits cease almost wholly, and the
      inhabitants of the Mont are left to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having so little intercourse with the outer world, and living on a rock
      singled out by supernatural visitants, the people remain more
      superstitious than even the superstitious Germans and Bretons who are
      their neighbours. Few of them can read or write. The new thoughts,
      opinions, and creeds of the present century do not reach them. They are
      contented with the old faith, bound up for them in the history of their
      patron, the archangel St. Michel, and with the minute interest taken in
      every native of the rock. Each person knows the history of every other
      inhabitant, but knows little else.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Pontorson to the Mont the road lies along the old Bay of St. Michel,
      with low hedge-rows of feathery tamarind-trees on each side as far as the
      beach. It is not at all a solitary road, for hundreds of long, heavy
      carts, resembling artillery waggons, encumber it, loaded with a gray shaly
      deposit dug out of the bay: a busy scene of men and women digging in the
      heavy sand, while the shaggy horses stand by, hanging their heads
      patiently under the blue-stained sheepskins about their necks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three persons are at work at every cart; one of them, often a
      woman, standing on the rising pile, and beating it flat with a spade,
      while a cheerful clatter of voices is heard on every hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at one time a man might have been seen there working alone, quite
      alone. Even a space was left about him, as if an invisible circle were
      drawn, within which no person would venture. If a word were flung at him
      across this imaginary cordon, it was nothing but a taunt or a curse, and
      it was invariably spoken by a man. No woman so much as glanced at him. He
      toiled on doggedly, and in silence, with a weary-looking face, until his
      task was ended, and the waggon driven off by the owner, who had employed
      him at a lower rate than his comrades. Then he would throw his blue blouse
      over his shoulders, and tramp away with heavy tread along the faintly
      marked trail leading across the beach to Mont St. Michel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither was there any voice to greet him as he gained the gateway, where
      the men of the Mont congregated, as they always congregate about the
      entrance to a walled town. Rather, the scornful silence which had
      surrounded him at his work was here deepened into a personal hatred.
      Within the gate the women, who were chattering over their nets of cockles,
      shrank away from him, or broke into a contemptuous laugh. Along the narrow
      street the children fled at the sight of him, and hid behind their
      mothers, from whose protection they could shout after him. If the cure met
      him, he would turn aside into the first house rather than come in contact
      with him. He was under a ban which no one dared to defy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only voice that spoke to him was the fretful, querulous voice of an
      old, bedridden woman as he lifted the latch and opened the door of a poor
      house upon the ramparts, which had no entrance into the street; and where
      he lived alone with his mother, cut off from all accidental intercourse
      with his neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Michel! Michel! how late thou art!&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;if thou hadst been a
      good son thou wouldst have returned before the hour it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I returned as soon as my work was finished,&rdquo; he answered, in a patient
      voice; &ldquo;I have not lost a minute by the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! because no one will ask thee to turn in with them anywhere!&rdquo; she
      continued. &ldquo;If thou wert like everybody else thou wouldst have many a
      friend to pass thy time with. It is hard for me, thy mother, to have
      brought thee into the world that all the world should despise and hate
      thee, as they do this day. Monsieur le Cure says there is no hope for thee
      if thou art so obstinate; thou must go to hell, though I named thee after
      our great archangel St. Michel, and brought thee up as a good Christian.
      <i>Quel malheur!</i> How hard it is for me to lie in bed all day, and
      think of my son in the flames of hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very quietly, as if he had heard such complainings hundreds of times
      before, did Michel set about kindling a few sticks upon the open hearth.
      This was so common a welcome home that he scarcely heard it, and had
      ceased to heed it. The room, as the flickering light fell upon it, was one
      of the cheerless and comfortless chambers to be seen in any peasant&rsquo;s
      house: a pile of wood in one corner, a single table with a chair or two, a
      shelf with a few pieces of brown crockery, and the bed on which the
      paralytic woman was lying, her hands crossed over her breast, and her
      bright black eyes glistening in the gloom. Michel brought her the soup he
      had made, and fed her carefully and tenderly, before thinking of
      satisfying his own hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is of no good, Michel,&rdquo; she said, when he laid her down again upon the
      pillow he had made smooth for her; &ldquo;it is of no good. Thou mayest as well
      leave me to perish; it will not weigh for thee. Monsieur le Cure says if
      thou hadst been born a heretic perhaps the good God might have taken it
      into account. But thou wert born a Christian, as good a Christian as all
      the world, and thou hast sold thy birthright to the devil. Leave me then,
      and take thy pleasure in this life, for thou wilt have nothing but misery
      in the next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not leave thee&mdash;never!&rdquo; he answered, briefly. &ldquo;I have no fear
      of the next world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a man of few words evidently. Perhaps the silence maintained around
      him had partly frozen his power of speech. Even to his mother he spoke but
      little, though her complaining went on without ceasing, until he
      extinguished both fire and lamp, and climbed the rude ladder into the loft
      overhead, where her voice never failed to rouse him from his sleep, if she
      only called &ldquo;Michel!&rdquo; He could not clearly explain his position even to
      himself. He had gone to Paris many years before, where he came across some
      Protestants, who had taught him to read the Testament, and instructed him
      in their religion. The new faith had taken hold of him, and thrust deep
      roots into his simple and constant nature; though he had no words at
      command to express the change to others, and scarcely to himself. So long
      as he had been in Paris there had been no need of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now his father&rsquo;s death had compelled him to return to his native
      place, and to the little knot of people who knew him as old Pierre Lorio&rsquo;s
      son, a fisherman like themselves, with no more right to read or think than
      they had. The fierceness of the persecution he encountered filled him with
      dismay, though it had not shaken his fidelity to his new faith. But often
      a dumb, inarticulate longing possessed him to make known to his old
      neighbours the reason of the change in him, but speech failed him. He
      could only stammer out his confession, &ldquo;I am no longer a Catholic, I am a
      Protestant, I cannot pray to the saints, not even to the archangel St.
      Michel or the Blessed Virgin. I pray only to God.&rdquo; For anything else, for
      explanation, and for all argument, he had no more language than the mute,
      wistful language one sees in the eyes of dumb creatures, when they gaze
      fully at us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps there is nothing more pitiful than the painful want of words to
      express that which lies deepest within us; a want common to us all, but
      greatest in those who have had no training in thus shaping and expressing
      their inmost thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not much to fear from a man like this. Michel Lorio was a living
      lesson against apostasy. As he went up and down the street, and in and out
      of the gate, his loneliness and dejection spoke more eloquently for the
      old faith than any banishment could have done. Michel was suffered to
      remain under a ban, not formal and ceremonial, but a tacit ban, which
      quite as effectively set him apart, and made his life more solitary than
      if he had been dwelling alone on a desert rock out at sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michel accepted his lot without complaint and without bitterness. He never
      passed Monsieur le Cure without a salutation. When he went daily for water
      to the great cistern of the monastery, he was always ready to carry the
      brimful pails too heavy for the arms of the old women and children. If he
      had leisure he mounted the long flights of grass-grown steps three or four
      times for his neighbours, depositing his burden at their doors, without a
      word of thanks for his help being vouchsafed to him. Now and then he
      overheard a sneer at his usefulness; and his mother taunted him often for
      his patience and forbearance. But he went on his way silently with deeper
      yearning for human love and sympathy than he could make known.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it had not been that, when he was kneeling at the rude dormer-window of
      his loft and gazing dreamily across the wide sweep of sand, with the moon
      shining across it and the solemn stars lighting up the sky, he was at
      times vaguely conscious of an influence, almost a presence, as of a hand
      that touched him and a voice that spoke to him, he must have sunk under
      this intense longing for love and fellowship. Had he been a Catholic
      still, he would have believed that the archangel St. Michel was near and
      about to manifest himself as in former times in his splendid shrine upon
      the Mont. The new faith had not cast out all the old superstitious nature;
      yet it was this vague spiritual presence which supported him under the
      crushing and unnatural conditions of his social life. He endured, as
      seeing one who is invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet at other times he could not keep his feet away from the little street
      where all the life there was might be found. At night he would creep
      cautiously along the ramparts and descend by a quiet staircase into an
      angle of the walls, where he could look on unseen upon the gathering of
      townsfolk in the inn where he had often gone with his father in earlier
      days. The landlord, Nicolas, was a most bitter enemy now. There was the
      familiar room filled with bright light from an oil-lamp and the brighter
      flicker of a wood fire where the landlord&rsquo;s wife was cooking. A deep, low
      recess in the corner, with a crimson valance stretched across it, held a
      bed with snow-white pillows, upon one of which rested a child&rsquo;s curly head
      with eyes fast sealed against the glare of the lamp. At a table close by
      sat the landlord and three or four of the wealthier men of the Mont busily
      and seriously eating the omelets and fried fish served to them from the
      pan over the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The copper and brass cooking utensils glittered in the light from the
      walls where they hung. It was a cheery scene, and Michel would stand in
      his cold, dark corner, watching it until all was over and the guests ready
      to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art Michel <i>le diable</i>!&rdquo; said a childish voice to him one
      evening, and he felt a small, warm hand laid for an instant upon his own.
      It was Delphine, Nicolas&rsquo;s eldest girl, a daring child, full of spirit and
      courage; yet even she shrank back a step or two after touching him, and
      stood as if ready to take flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Michel Lorio,&rdquo; he answered, in a quiet, pleasant voice, which won
      her back to his side. &ldquo;Why dost thou call me Michel <i>le diable</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the world calls thee that,&rdquo; answered Delphine; &ldquo;thou art a heretic.
      See, I am a good Christian. I say my ave and paternoster every night; if
      thou wilt do the same thing, no one will call thee Michel <i>le diable</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art not afraid of me?&rdquo; he asked, for the child put her hand again on
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! thou art not the real devil!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and <i>maman</i> has put
      my name on the register of the monument; so the great archangel St. Michel
      will deliver me from all evil. What canst thou do? Canst thou turn
      children into cats? or canst thou walk across the sea without being
      drowned? or canst thou stand on the highest pinnacle of the church, where
      the golden image of St. Michel used to be, and cast thyself down without
      killing thyself? I will go back with thee to thy house and see what thou
      canst do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can do none of these things,&rdquo; answered Michel, &ldquo;not one; but thou shalt
      come home with me if thou wilt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I may feel how strong thou art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted her easily into his arms, for he was strong and accustomed to
      bear heavier burdens. His heart beat fast as the child&rsquo;s hand stole round
      his neck and her soft cheek touched his own. Delphine had never been upon
      the ramparts before when the stars were out and the distant circle of the
      cliffs hidden by the night, and several times he was compelled to stop and
      answer her eager questions; but she would not go into the house when they
      reached the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry me back again, Michel,&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;I do not like thy mother.
      Thou shalt bring me again along the ramparts to-morrow night. I will
      always come to thee, always when I see thee standing in the dark corner by
      our house. I love thee much, Michel <i>le diable</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a strange friendship carried on stealthily. Michel could not put
      away from himself this one little tie of human love and fellowship. As for
      Delphine, she was as silent about her new friend as children often are of
      such things which affect them deeply. There was a mingling of
      superstitious feeling in her affection for Michel&mdash;a half-dread that
      gave their secret meetings a greater charm to the daring spirit of the
      child. The evening was a busy time at the inn, and if Delphine had been
      missed, but little wonder and no anxiety would have been aroused at her
      absence. The ramparts were deserted after dark, and no one guessed that
      the two dark figures sauntering to and fro were Michel and Delphine. When
      the nights were too cold they took refuge in a little overhanging turret
      projecting from one of the angles of the massive walls&mdash;a darksome
      niche with nothing but the sky to be seen through a narrow embrasure in
      the shape of a cross. In these haunts Michel talked in his simple untaught
      way of his thoughts and of his new faith, pouring into the child&rsquo;s ear
      what he could never tell to any other. By day Delphine never seemed to see
      him; never cast a look toward him as he passed by amid the undisguised ill
      will of the town. She ceased to speak of him even, with the unconscious
      and natural dissimulation by which children screen themselves from
      criticism and censure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people of the Mont St. Michel are very poor, and the women and
      children are compelled to seek some means of earning money as well as the
      men. As long as the summer lasts the crowds of pilgrims and tourists,
      flocking to the wonderful fortress and shrine upon the summit, bring
      employment and gain to some portion of them; but in the winter there is
      little to do except when the weather is fine enough to search for
      shell-fish about the sands, and sell them in the villages of the mainland.
      As the tide goes down, bands of women and children follow it out for
      miles, taking care to retrace their steps before the sea rises again. From
      Michel&rsquo;s cottage on the ramparts the whole plain toward Avranches was
      visible, and he could hear the busy hum of voices coming to his ear from
      afar through the quiet air. But on the western side of the Mont, where the
      black line of the river crosses the sands, they are more dangerous; and in
      this direction only the more venturesome seekers go&mdash;boys who love
      any risk, and widows who are the more anxious to fill their nets because
      they have no man to help them in getting their daily bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      The early part of the winter is not cold in Normandy, especially by the
      sea. As long as the westerly winds sweep across the Atlantic, the air is
      soft though damp, with fine mists hanging in it, which shine with rainbow
      tints in the sunlight. Sometimes Christmas and the New Year find the air
      still genial, in spite of the short days and the long rainy nights. Strong
      gales may blow, but so long as they do not come from the dry east or
      frosty north there is no real severity of weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was such a Christmas week that year. Not one of the women or children
      had yet been forced to stay away from the sands on account of the cold.
      Upon Christmas eve there was a good day, though, a short one, before them,
      for it was low water about noon, and the high tide would not be in before
      six. All the daylight would be theirs. It was a chance not to be missed,
      for as the tides grew later in the day their time for fishing would be cut
      shorter. Almost every woman and child turned out through the gate with
      their nets in their hands. By midday the plain was dotted over by them,
      and the wintry sun shone pleasantly down, and the quiet rock caught the
      echo of their voices. Farther away, out of sight and hearing, the men also
      were busy, Michel among them, casting nets upon the sea. As the low sun
      went down in the southern sky, the scattered groups came home by twos and
      threes, anxious to bring in their day&rsquo;s fishing in time for the men to
      carry them across to the mainland before the Mont should be shut in by the
      tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      A busy scene was that in the gateway.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the town was there; some coming in from the sands, and those who had
      been left at home with babies or old folks running down from their houses.
      There was chaffing and bartering; exchanges agreed upon, and commissions
      innumerable to be intrusted to the men about to set out for Pontorson, the
      nearest town. Michel Lorio was going to sell his own fish, for who would
      carry it for him? Yet though he was the first who was ready to start, not
      a soul charged him with a single commission. He lingered wistfully and
      loitered just outside the gateway; but neither man, woman, nor child said,
      &ldquo;Michel, bring me what I want from the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was treading slowly down the rough causeway under the walls of the
      town, when a woman&rsquo;s shrill voice startled him. It was not far from
      sunset, and the sun was sinking round and red behind a bank of fog. A thin
      gray mist was creeping up from the sea. The latest band of stragglers, a
      cluster of mere children, were running across the sand to the gate. Michel
      turned round and saw Nicolas&rsquo;s wife, a dark, stern-looking woman,
      beckoning vehemently to these children. He paused for a moment to look at
      his little Delphine. &ldquo;Not there!&rdquo; he said to himself, and was passing on,
      when the shrill voice again caught his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Phine?&rdquo; called the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was it the children said? What answer had they shouted back? Michel
      stood motionless, as if all strength had failed him suddenly. The children
      rushed past him in a troop. He lifted up his eyes, looking fearfully
      toward the sea hidden behind the deepening fog. Was it possible that he
      had heard them say that Delphine was lost?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Phine?&rdquo; asked the mother; but though her voice was lower now,
      Michel heard every syllable loudly. It seemed as if he could have heard a
      whisper, though the chattering in the gateway was like the clamour of a
      fair. The eldest girl in the little band spoke in a hurried and frightened
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phine is so naughty, madame,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we could not keep her near us.
      She would go on and on to the sea. We could not wait for her. We heard her
      calling, but it was so far, we dared not go back. But she cannot be far
      behind us, for we shouted as we came along. She will be here soon,
      madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu!</i>&rdquo; cried the mother, sinking down on one of the great
      stones, either rolled up by the tide, or left by the masons who built the
      ramparts. &ldquo;Call her father to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Michel Lorio who found Nicolas, his greatest enemy. Nicolas had a
      number of errands to be done in the town, and he was busy impressing them
      on the memory of his messenger, who, like every one else, could neither
      read nor write. When Michel caught his arm in a sharp, fast grip, he
      turned round with a scowl, and tried, but in vain, to shake off his grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to thy wife,&rdquo; said Michel, dragging him toward the gate; &ldquo;Delphine,
      thy little one, is lost on the sands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole crowd heard the words, for Michel&rsquo;s voice was pitched in a high,
      shrill key, which rang above the clamour and the babel. There was an
      instant hush, every one listening to Michel, and every eye fastened upon
      him. Nicolas stared blankly at him, as if unable to understand him, yet
      growing passive under his sense of bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The children who went out with Delphine this morning are come back,&rdquo;
       continued Michel, in the same forced tone; &ldquo;they are come back without
      her. She is lost on the sands. The night is falling, and there is a fog. I
      tell you the little one is alone, quite alone, upon the sands; and it will
      be high water at six o&rsquo;clock. Delphine is alone and lost upon the sands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The momentary hush of the crowd was at an end. The children began crying,
      and the women calling loudly upon St. Michel and the Holy Virgin. The men
      gathered about Nicolas and Michel, and went down in a compact group to the
      causeway beyond the gate. There the lurid sun, shining dimly through the
      fog, made the most sanguine look grave and shake their heads hopelessly
      behind the father and mother. The latter sat motionless, looking out with
      straining eyes to see if Delphine were not coming through the thickening
      mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mais que faire! que faire!</i>&rdquo; cried Nicolas, catching at somebody&rsquo;s
      shoulder for support without seeing whose it was. It was Michel&rsquo;s, who had
      not stirred from his side since he had first clasped his arm. Michel&rsquo;s
      face was as white as the mother&rsquo;s; but there was a resolute light in his
      eyes that was not to be seen in hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing can be done,&rdquo; answered one of the oldest men in answer to
      Nicolas&rsquo;s cry, &ldquo;nothing, nothing! We do not know where the child is lost.
      See! there are leagues and leagues of sand; and one might wander miles
      away from where the poor little creature is at this instant. The great
      archangel St. Michel protect her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; said the mother, lifting herself up; and, raising her voice,
      she called loudly, with a cry that rang and echoed against the walls,
      &ldquo;Phine! Phine! my little Phine, come back to thy poor mother!&rdquo; But there
      was no answer, except the sobs and prayers of the women and children
      clustering behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou canst not go!&rdquo; exclaimed Nicolas; &ldquo;there are our other little ones
      to think of; nor can I leave thee and them. My God! is there then no one
      who will go and seek my little Delphine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; answered Michel, standing out from among the crowd, and
      facing it with his white face and resolute eyes; &ldquo;there is only one among
      you all upon the Mont who will miss me. I leave my mother to your care.
      There is no time for me to bid her adieu. If I come back alive, well! if I
      perish, that will be well also!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even then there was no cordiality of response on the hearts of his old
      friends and neighbours. The superstition and prejudice of long years could
      not be broken down in one moment and by one act of self-sacrifice. They
      watched Michel as he laid his full creel down from his shoulders, and
      threw across them the strong square net with which he fished in the ebbing
      tide. His silence was no less expressive than theirs. Without a sound he
      passed away barefooted down the rude causeway. His face, as the sun shone
      on it, was set and resolute with a determination to face the end, whatever
      the end might be. He might have so trodden the path to Calvary.
    </p>
    <p>
      He longed to speak to them, to say adieu to them; but he waited in vain
      for one voice to break the silence. He turned round before he was too far
      away, and saw them still clustered without the gate; every one of them
      known to him from his boyhood, the story of whose lives had been bound up
      with his own and formed a part of his history. They were all there, except
      his mother, who would soon hear what peril of the sea and peril of the
      night he was about to face. Tears dimmed his eyes, and made the group grow
      indistinct, as though the mist had already gathered between him and them.
      Then he quickened his steps, and the people of Mont St. Michel lost sight
      of him behind a great buttress of the ramparts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for a time Michel could still see the Mont as he hurried along its
      base, going westward, where the most treacherous sands lie. His home was
      on the eastern side, and he could see nothing of it. But the great rock
      rose up precipitously above him, and the noble architecture upon its
      highest point glowed with a ruddy tint in the setting light. As he
      trampled along no sound could be heard but the distant sigh of the sea,
      and the low, sad sough of the sand as his bare feet trod it. The fog
      before him was not dense, only a light haze, deceptive and beguiling; for
      here and there he turned aside, fancying he could see Delphine, but as he
      drew nearer to the spot he discovered nothing but a post driven into the
      sand. There was no fear that he should lose himself upon the bewildering
      level, for he knew his way as well as if the sand had been laid out in
      well-defined tracks. His dread was lest he should not find Delphine soon
      enough to escape from the tide, which would surely overwhelm them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      He scarcely knew how the time sped by, but the sun had sunk below the
      horizon, and he had quite lost the Mont in the fog. The brown sand and the
      gray dank mist were all that he could see, yet still he plodded on
      westward, toward the sea, calling into the growing darkness. At last he
      caught the sound of a child&rsquo;s sobs and crying, which ceased for a moment
      when he turned in that direction and shouted, &ldquo;Phine!&rdquo; Calling to one
      another, it was not long before he saw the child wandering forlornly and
      desolately in the mist. She ran sobbing into his open arms, and Michel
      lifted her up and held her to his heart with a strange rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is thou that hast found me,&rdquo; she said, clinging closely to him. &ldquo;Carry
      me back to my mother. I am safe now, quite safe. Did the archangel St.
      Michel send thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was not a moment to be lost; Michel knew that full well. The moan of
      the sea was growing louder every minute, though he could not see its
      advancing line. There was no spot upon the sand that would not be covered
      before another hour was gone, and there was barely time, if enough, to get
      back to the Mont. He could not waste time or breath in talking to the
      child he held fast in his arms. A pale gleam of moonlight shone through
      the vapour, but of little use to him save to throw a ghostly glimmer
      across the sands. He strode hurriedly along, breathing hardly through his
      teeth and clasping Delphine so fast that she grew frightened at his
      silence and haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where art thou taking me, Michel <i>le diable</i>?&rdquo; she said, beginning
      to struggle in his arms. &ldquo;Let me down; let me down, I tell thee! <i>Maman</i>
      has said I must never look at thee. Thou shalt not carry me any farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was strength enough in the child and her vehement struggles to free
      herself to hinder Michel in his desperate haste. He was obliged to stand
      still for a minute or two to pacify her, speaking in his quiet, patient
      voice, which she knew so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be tranquil, my little Phine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am come to save thee. As the
      Lord Jesus came to seek and to save those who are lost, so am I come to
      seek thee and carry thee back to thy mother. It is dark here, my child,
      and the sea is rising quickly, quickly. But thou shalt be safe. Be
      tranquil, and let me make haste back to the Mont.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the Lord save thee in this manner?&rdquo; asked Delphine, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, He saved me like this,&rdquo; answered Michel. &ldquo;He laid down His life for
      mine. Now thou must let me save thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be good and wise,&rdquo; said the child, putting her arms again about
      his neck, while he strode on, striving if possible to regain the few
      moments that had been lost. But it was not possible. He knew that before
      he had gone another kilometre, when through the mist there rose before him
      the dark, colossal form of the Mont, but too far away still for them both
      to reach it in safety. Thirty minutes were essential for him to reach the
      gates with his burden, but in little more than twenty the sea would be
      dashing round the walls. The tide was yet out of sight and the sands were
      dry, but it would rush in before many minutes, and the swiftest runner
      with no weight to carry could not outrun it. Both could not be saved;
      could either of them? He had foreseen this danger and provided for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My little Phine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thou wilt not be afraid if I place thee where
      thou wilt be quite safe from the sea? See, here is my net! I will put thee
      within it, and hang it on one of these strong stakes, and I will stand
      below thee. Thou wilt be brave and good. Let us be quick, very quick. It
      will be like a swing for thee, and thou wilt not be afraid so long as I
      stand below thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even while he spoke he was busy fastening the corners of his net securely
      over the stake, hanging it above the reach of the last tide-mark. Delphine
      watched him laughing. It seemed only another pleasant adventure, like
      wandering with him upon the ramparts, or taking shelter in the turret. The
      net held her comfortably, and by stooping down she could touch with her
      outstretched hand the head of Michel. He stood below her, his arms fast
      locked about the stake, and his face uplifted to her in the faint light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thou must not be afraid when the water lies below thee,
      even if I do not speak. Thou art safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Art thou safe also, Michel?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am quite safe also,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but I shall be very quiet. I
      shall not speak to thee. Yes; the Lord Christ is caring for me, as I for
      thee. He bound Himself to the cross as I bind myself here. This is my
      cross, Delphine. I understand it better now. He loved us and gave Himself
      for us. Tell them to-morrow what I say to thee. I am as safe as thou art,
      tranquil and happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall not be drowned!&rdquo; said Delphine, half in confidence and half in
      dread of the sea, which was surging louder and louder through the
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not thou!&rdquo; he answered, cheerily. &ldquo;But, Phine, tell them to-morrow that I
      shall nevermore be solitary and sad. I leave thee now, and then I shall be
      with Christ. I wish I could have spoken to them, but my heart and tongue
      were heavy. Hark! there is the bell ringing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bell which is tolled at night, when travellers are crossing the sands,
      to guide them to the Mont, flung its clear, sharp notes down from the
      great indistinct rock, looming through the dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is like a voice to me, the voice of a friend; but it is too late!&rdquo;
       murmured Michel. &ldquo;Art thou happy, Delphine, my little one? When I cease to
      speak to thee wilt thou not be afraid? I shall be asleep, perhaps. Say thy
      paternoster now, for it is growing late with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bell was still toiling, but with a quick, hurried movement, as if
      those who rang it were fevered with impatience. The roaring of the tide,
      as it now poured in rapidly over the plain, almost drowned its clang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Touch me with thy little hand, touch me quickly!&rdquo; cried Michel. &ldquo;Remember
      to tell them to-morrow that I loved them all always, and I would have
      given myself for them as I do for thee. Adieu, my little Phine. Come
      quickly, Lord Jesus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child told afterward that the water rose so fast that she dared not
      look at it, but shut her eyes as it spread, white and shimmering, in the
      moonlight all around her. She began to repeat her paternoster, but she
      forgot how the words came. But she heard Michel, in a loud clear voice,
      saying &ldquo;Our Father&rdquo;; only he also seemed to forget the words, for he did
      not say more than &ldquo;Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive&mdash;.&rdquo; Then
      he became quite silent, and when she spoke to him, after a long while, he
      did not answer her. She supposed he had fallen asleep, as he had said, but
      she could not help crying and calling to him again and again. The
      sea-gulls flew past her screaming, but there was no sound of any voice to
      speak to her. In spite of what he had said to her beforehand she grew
      frightened, and thought it was because she had been unkind to Michel <i>le
      diable</i> that she was left there alone, with the sea swirling to and fro
      beneath her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not for more than two or three hours that Delphine hung cradled in
      Michel&rsquo;s net, for the tide does not lie long round the Mont St. Michel,
      and flows out again as swiftly as it comes in. The people followed it out,
      scattering over the sands in the forlorn hope of finding the dead bodies
      of Michel Lorio and the child, for they had no expectation of meeting with
      either of them alive. At last two or three of them heard the voice of
      Delphine, who saw the glimmer of their lanterns upon the sands, and called
      shrilly and loudly for succour.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found her swinging safely in her net, untouched by the water. But
      Michel had sunk down upon his knees, though his arms were still fastened
      about the stake. His head had fallen forward upon his breast, and his
      thick wet hair covered his face. They lifted him without a word spoken. He
      had saved Delphine&rsquo;s life at the cost of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the townspeople were down at the gate, waiting for the return of those
      who had gone out to seek for the dead. The moon had risen above the fog,
      and shone clearly down upon them. Delphine&rsquo;s mother, with her younger
      children about her, sat on the stone where she had been sitting when
      Michel set out on his perilous quest. She and the other women could see a
      crowd of the men coming back, carrying some burden among them. But as they
      drew near to the gate, Delphine sprang forward from among them and ran and
      threw herself into her mother&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;A miracle!&rdquo; cried some voices amid
      the crowd; a miracle wrought by their patron St. Michel. If Michel Lorio
      were safe, surely he would become again a good Christian, and return to
      his ancient faith. But Michel Lorio was dead, and all that could be done
      for him was to carry his dead body home to his paralytic mother, and lay
      it upon his bed in the little loft where he had spent so many hours of
      sorrowful loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a perplexing problem to the simple people. Some said that Michel
      had been permitted to save the child by a diabolic agency which had failed
      him when he sought to save himself. Others maintained that it was no other
      than the great archangel St. Michel who had securely fastened the net upon
      the stake and so preserved Delphine, while the heretic was left to perish.
      A few thought secretly, and whispered it in fear, that Michel had done a
      noble deed, and won heaven thereby. The cure, who came to look upon the
      calm dead face, opened his lips after long and profound thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this man had been a Christian,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he would have been a saint
      and a martyr.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      A PERILOUS AMOUR, By S. J. Weyman
    </h2>
    <p>
      AN EPISODE ADAPTED FROM THE MEMOIRS OF MAXIMILIAN DE BETHUNE, DUKE OF
      SULLY
    </p>
    <p>
      Such in brief were the reasons which would have led me, had I followed the
      promptings of my own sagacity, to oppose the return of the Jesuits. It
      remains for me only to add that these arguments lost all their weight when
      set in the balance against the safety of my beloved master. To this plea
      the king himself for once condescended, and found those who were most
      strenuous to dissuade him the least able to refute it; since the more a
      man abhorred the Jesuits, the more ready he was to allow that the king&rsquo;s
      life could not be safe from their practices while the edict against them
      remained in force. The support which I gave to the king on this occasion
      exposed me to the utmost odium of my co-religionists, and was in later
      times ill-requited by the order. But a remarkable incident that occurred
      while the matter was still under debate, and which I now for the first
      time make public, proved beyond question the wisdom of my conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fontainebleau being at this time in the hands of the builders, the king
      had gone to spend his Easter at Chantilly, whither Mademoiselle
      d&rsquo;Entragues had also repaired. During his absence from Paris I was seated
      one morning in my library at the Arsenal, when I was informed that Father
      Cotton, the same who at Metz had presented a petition from the Jesuits,
      and who was now in Paris pursuing that business under a safe-conduct,
      craved leave to pay his respects to me. I was not surprised, for I had
      been a little before this of some service to him. The pages of the court,
      while loitering outside the Louvre, had raised a tumult in the streets,
      and grievously insulted the father by shouting after him, &ldquo;Old Wool! Old
      Cotton!&rdquo; in imitation of the Paris street cry. For this the king, at my
      instigation, had caused them to be soundly whipped, and I supposed that
      the Jesuit now desired to thank me for advice&mdash;given, in truth,
      rather out of regard to discipline than to him. So I bade them admit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first words, uttered before my secretaries could retire, indicated
      that this was indeed his errand; and for a few moments I listened to such
      statements from him and made such answers myself as became our several
      positions. Then, as he did not go, I began to conceive the notion that he
      had come with a further purpose; and his manner, which seemed on this
      occasion to lack ease, though he was well gifted with skill and address,
      confirmed the notion. I waited, therefore, with patience, and presently he
      named his Majesty with many expressions of devotion to his person. &ldquo;I
      trust,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that the air of Fontainebleau agrees with him, M. de
      Rosny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean, good father, of Chantilly?&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, to be sure!&rdquo; he rejoined, hastily. &ldquo;He is, of course, at Chantilly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that he rose to depart, but was delayed by the raptures into which
      he fell at sight of the fire, which, the weather being cold for the time
      of year, I had caused to be lit. &ldquo;It burns so brightly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that it
      must be of boxwood, M. de Rosny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of boxwood?&rdquo; I exclaimed, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, is it not of boxwood?&rdquo; quoth he, looking at me with much simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; I made answer, rather peevishly. &ldquo;Who ever heard of
      people burning boxwood in Paris, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He apologised for his ignorance&mdash;which was indeed matter of wonder&mdash;on
      the ground of his southern birth, and took his departure, leaving me in
      much doubt as to the real purport of his visit. I was indeed more troubled
      by the uncertainty I felt than another less conversant with the methods of
      the Jesuits might have been, for I knew that it was their habit to let
      drop a word where they dared not speak plainly, and I felt myself put on
      my mettle to interpret the father&rsquo;s hint. My perplexities were increased
      by the belief that he would not have intervened in any matter of small
      moment, and by the conviction, which grew upon me apace, that while I
      stood idle before the hearth my dearest interests and those of France were
      at stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Michel,&rdquo; I said at last, addressing the <i>doyen</i> of my secretaries,
      who chanced to be a Provencal, &ldquo;have you ever seen a boxwood fire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He replied respectfully, but with some show of surprise, that he had not,
      adding that that wood was rendered so valuable to the turner by its
      hardness that few people would be extravagant enough to use it for fuel. I
      assented, and felt the more certain that the Jesuit&rsquo;s remark contained a
      hidden meaning. The only other clue I had consisted in the apparent
      mistake the father had made as to the king&rsquo;s residence, and this might
      have been dropped from him in pure inadvertence. Yet I was inclined to
      think it intentional, and construed it as implying that the matter
      concerned the king personally. Which the more alarmed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I passed the day in great anxiety, but toward evening, acting on a sudden
      inspiration, I sent La Trape, my valet, a trusty fellow who had saved my
      life at Cahors, to the Three Pigeons, a large inn in the suburbs, at which
      such travellers from North to South as did not wish to enter the city were
      accustomed to change horses and sometimes to sleep. Acquitting himself of
      the commission I had given him with his usual adroitness, he quickly
      returned with the news that a traveller of rank had passed through three
      days before, having sent in advance to order relays there and at Essonnes.
      La Trape reported that the gentleman had remained in his coach, and that
      none of the inn servants had seen his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he had companions?&rdquo; I said. My mind had not failed already to
      conceive a natural suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one, your Grace. The rest were servants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man in the yard fancied that he recognised M. de la Varenne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; I said no more. My agitation was indeed such that, before giving
      reins to it, I bade La Trape withdraw. I could scarcely believe that,
      perfectly acquainted as the king was with the plots which Spain and the
      Catholics were daily weaving for his life, and possessing such unavowed
      but powerful enemies among the great lords as Tremouille and Bouillon, to
      say nothing of Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Entragues&rsquo;s half-brother, the Count of
      Auvergne&mdash;I could hardly believe that with this knowledge his Majesty
      had been so foolhardy as to travel without guards or attendance to
      Fontainebleau. And yet I now felt an absolute certainty that this was the
      case. The presence of La Varenne also, the confidant of his intrigues,
      informed me of the cause of this wild journey, convincing me that his
      Majesty had given way to the sole weakness of his nature, and was bent on
      one of those adventures of gallantry which had been more becoming in the
      Prince of Bearn than in the king of France. Neither was I at a loss to
      guess the object of his pursuit. It had been lately whispered in the court
      that the king had seen and fallen in love with his mistress&rsquo;s younger
      sister, Susette d&rsquo;Entragues, whose home at Malesherbes lay but three
      leagues from Fontainebleau, on the edge of the forest. This placed the
      king&rsquo;s imprudence in a stronger light, for he had scarcely in France a
      more dangerous enemy than her brother Auvergne; nor had the immense sums
      which he had settled on the elder sister satisfied the mean avarice or
      conciliated the brutish hostility of her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apprised of all this, I saw that Father Cotton had desired to communicate
      it to me. But his motive I found it less easy to divine. It might have
      been a wish to balk this new passion through my interference, and at the
      same time to expose me to the risk of his Majesty&rsquo;s anger. Or it might
      simply have been a desire to avert danger from the king&rsquo;s person. At any
      rate, constant to my rule of ever preferring my master&rsquo;s interest to his
      favour, I sent for Maignan, my equerry, and bade him have an equipage
      ready at dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly at that hour next morning, attended only by La Trape, with a
      groom, a page, and four Swiss, I started, giving out that I was bound for
      Sully to inspect that demesne, which had formerly been the property of my
      family, and of which the refusal had just been offered to me. Under cover
      of this destination I was enabled to reach La Ferte Alais unsuspected.
      There, pretending that the motion of the coach fatigued me, I mounted the
      led horse, without which I never travelled, and bidding La Trape accompany
      me, gave orders to the others to follow at their leisure to Pethiviers,
      where I proposed to stay the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Ferte Alais, on the borders of the forest, is some five leagues
      westward of Fontainebleau, and as far north of Malesherbes, with which
      last it is connected by a highroad. Having disclosed my intentions to La
      Trape, however, I presently left this road and struck into a path which
      promised to conduct us in the right direction. But the denseness of the
      undergrowth, and the huge piles of gray rocks which lie everywhere strewn
      about the forest, made it difficult to keep for any time in a straight
      line. After being two hours in the saddle we concluded that we had lost
      our way, and were confirmed in this on reaching a clearing, and seeing
      before us a small inn, which La Trape recognised as standing about a
      league and a half on the forest side of Malesherbes.
    </p>
    <p>
      We still had ample time to reach Fontainebleau by nightfall, but before
      proceeding it was absolutely necessary that our horses should have rest.
      Dismounting, therefore, I bade La Trape see the sorrel well baited.
      Observing that the inn was a poor place, and no one coming to wait upon
      me, I entered it of my own motion, and found myself at once in a large
      room better furnished with company than accommodation. Three men, who had
      the appearance of such reckless swaggering blades as are generally to be
      found drinking in the inns on the outskirts of Paris, and who come not
      unfrequently to their ends at Montfaucon, were tippling and playing cards
      at a table near the door. They looked up sullenly at my entrance, but
      refrained from saluting me, which, as I was plainly dressed and much
      stained by travel, was in some degree pardonable. By the fire, partaking
      of a coarse meal, was a fourth man of so singular an appearance that I
      must needs describe him. He was of great height and extreme leanness. His
      face matched his form, for it was long and thin, terminating in a small
      peaked beard which, like his hair and mustachios, was as white as snow.
      With all this, his eyes glowed with much of the fire of youth, and his
      brown complexion and sinewy hands seemed still to indicate robust health.
      He was dressed in garments which had once been fashionable, but now bore
      marks of long and rough usage, and I remarked that the point of his sword,
      which, as he sat, trailed on the stones behind him, had worn its way
      through the scabbard. Notwithstanding these signs of poverty, he saluted
      me with the ease and politeness of a gentleman, and bade me with much
      courtesy to share his table and the fire. Accordingly I drew up, and
      called for a bottle of the best wine, being minded to divert myself with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was little prepared, however, for the turn his conversation took, and
      the furious tirade into which he presently broke, the object of which
      proved to be no other than myself! I do not know that I have ever cut so
      whimsical a figure as while hearing my name loaded with reproaches; but,
      being certain that he did not know me, I waited patiently, and soon
      learned both who he was, and the grievance which he was on his way to lay
      before the king. His name was Boisrose, and he had been the leader in that
      gallant capture of Fecamp, which took place while I was in Normandy as the
      king&rsquo;s representative. His grievance was that, notwithstanding promises in
      my letters, he had been deprived of the government of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He leads the king by the ear!&rdquo; he declaimed loudly, in an accent which
      marked him for a Gascon. &ldquo;That villain of a De Rosny! But I will show him
      up! I will trounce him!&rdquo; With that he drew the hilt of his long rapier to
      the front with a gesture so truculent that the three bullies, who had
      stopped to laugh at him, resumed their game in disorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his hatred for me, I was pleased to meet with a man of so
      singular a temper, whom I also knew to be truly courageous; and I was
      willing to amuse myself further with him. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I said, modestly, &ldquo;I have
      had some affairs with M. de Rosny, and I have never found him cheat me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not deceive yourself!&rdquo; he roared, slapping the table. &ldquo;He is a
      rascal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; I ventured to reply, &ldquo;I have heard that in many respects he is not
      a bad minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a villain!&rdquo; he repeated, so loudly as to drown what I would have
      added. &ldquo;Do not tell me otherwise. But rest assured! be happy, sir! I will
      make the king see him in his true colours! Rest content, sir! I will
      trounce him! He has to do with Armand de Boisrose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that he was not open to argument,&mdash;for, indeed, being opposed,
      he grew exceedingly warm,&mdash;I asked him by what channel he intended to
      approach the king, and learned that here he felt a difficulty, since he
      had neither a friend at court nor money to buy one. Being assured that he
      was an honest fellow, and knowing that the narrative of our rencontre and
      its sequel would vastly amuse his Majesty, who loved a jest of this kind,
      I advised Boisrose to go boldly to the king, which, thanking me as
      profusely as he had before reproached me, he agreed to do. With that I
      rose to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the last moment it occurred to me to try upon him the shibboleth which
      in Father Cotton&rsquo;s mouth had so mystified me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This fire burns brightly,&rdquo; I said, kicking the logs together with my
      riding-boot. &ldquo;It must be of boxwood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what, sir?&rdquo; quoth he, politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of boxwood, to be sure,&rdquo; I replied, in a louder tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My certes!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;They do not burn boxwood in this country.
      Those are larch trimmings&mdash;neither more nor less!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he wondered at my ignorance, I was pleased to discover his, and so
      far I had lost my pains. But it did not escape me that the three gamesters
      had ceased to play and were listening intently to our conversation.
      Moreover, as I moved to the door, they followed me with their eyes; and
      when I turned, after riding a hundred yards, I found that they had come to
      the door and were still gazing after us.
    </p>
    <p>
      This prevented me at once remarking that a hound which had which had been
      lying before the fire had accompanied us, and was now running in front,
      now gambolling round us, as the manner of dogs is. When, however, after
      riding about two thirds of a league, we came to a place where the roads
      forked, I had occasion particularly to notice the hound, for, choosing one
      of the paths, it stood in the mouth of it, wagging its tail, and inviting
      us to take that road; and this so pertinaciously that, though the
      directions we had received at the inn would have led us to prefer the
      other, we determined to follow the dog as the more trustworthy guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had proceeded about four hundred paces when La Trape pointed out that
      the path was growing more narrow and showed few signs of being used. So
      certain did it seem&mdash;though the dog still ran confidently ahead&mdash;that
      we were again astray, that I was about to draw rein and return, when I
      discovered with some emotion that the undergrowth on the right of the path
      had assumed the character of a thick hedge of box. Though less prone than
      most men to put faith in omens, I accepted this as one, and,
      notwithstanding that it wanted but an hour of sunset, I rode on steadily,
      remarking that, with each turn in the woodland path, the scrub on my left
      also gave place to the sturdy tree which had been in my mind all day.
      Finally we found ourselves passing through an alley of box,&mdash;which,
      no long time before, had been clipped and dressed,&mdash;until a final
      turn brought me into a cul-de-sac, a kind of arbor, carpeted with grass,
      and so thickly set about as to afford no exit save by the entrance. Here
      the dog placidly stood and wagged its tail, looking up at us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must confess that this termination of the adventure seemed so
      surprising, and the evening light shining on the walls of green round us
      was so full of a solemn quiet, that I was not surprised to hear La Trape
      mutter a short prayer. For my part, assured that something more than
      chance had brought me hither, I dismounted, and spoke encouragement to the
      hound; but it only leaped upon me. Then I walked round the enclosure, and
      presently remarked, close to the hedge, three small patches where the
      grass was slightly trodden down. Another glance told me much, for I saw
      that at these places the hedge, about three feet from the ground, bore
      traces of the axe. Choosing the nearest spot, I stooped, until my eyes
      were level with the hole thus made, and discovered that I was looking
      through a funnel skilfully cut in the wall of box. At my end the opening
      was rather larger than a man&rsquo;s face; at the other end about as large as
      the palm of the hand. The funnel rose gradually, so that I took the
      further extremity of it to be about seven feet from the ground, and here
      it disclosed a feather dangling on a spray. From the light falling
      strongly on this, I judged it to be not in the hedge, but a pace or two
      from it on the hither side of another fence of box. On examining the
      remaining loopholes I discovered that they bore upon the same feather.
    </p>
    <p>
      My own mind was at once made up, but I bade my valet go through the same
      investigation, and then asked him whether he had ever seen an ambush of
      this kind laid for game. He replied at once that the shot would pass over
      the tallest stag; and, fortified by this, I mounted without saying more,
      and we retraced our steps. The hound presently slipped away, and without
      further adventure we reached Fontainebleau a little after sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      I expected to be received by the king with coldness and displeasure, but
      it chanced that a catarrh had kept him within doors all day, and, unable
      to hunt or to visit his new flame, he had been at leisure in this palace
      without a court to consider the imprudence he was committing. He received
      me, therefore, with the hearty laugh of a school-boy detected in a petty
      fault; and as I hastened to relate to him some of the things which M. de
      Boisrose had said of the Baron de Rosny, I soon had the gratification of
      perceiving that my presence was not taken amiss. His Majesty gave orders
      that bedding should be furnished for my pavilion, and that his household
      should wait on me, and himself sent me from his table a couple of chickens
      and a fine melon, bidding me at the same time to come to him when I had
      supped.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did so, and found him alone in his closet, awaiting me with impatience,
      for he had already divined that I had not made this journey merely to
      reproach him. Before informing him, however, of my suspicions, I craved
      leave to ask him one or two questions, and, in particular, whether he had
      been in the habit of going to Malesherbes daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daily,&rdquo; he admitted, with a grimace. &ldquo;What more, grand master?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By what road, sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have commonly hunted in the morning and visited Malesherbes at midday.
      I have returned as a rule by the bridle-path, which crosses the Rock of
      the Serpents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patience, sir, one moment,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Does that path run anywhere through
      a plantation of box?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; he answered, without hesitation. &ldquo;About half a mile on this
      side of the rock it skirts Madame Catherine&rsquo;s maze.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereon I told the king without reserve all that had happened. He listened
      with the air of apparent carelessness which he always assumed when the
      many plots against his life were under discussion; but at the end he
      embraced me again and again with tears in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;France is beholden to you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have never had, nor shall have,
      such another servant as you, Rosny! The three ruffians at the inn,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;are the tools, of course, and the hound has been in the habit
      of accompanying them to the spot. Yesterday, I remember, I walked by that
      place with the bridle on my arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a special providence, sire,&rdquo; I said, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he answered, crossing himself, a thing I had never yet known
      him to do in private. &ldquo;But now, who is the craftsman who has contrived
      this pretty plot? Tell me that, grand master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On this point, however, though I had my suspicions, I begged leave to be
      excused speaking until I had slept upon it. &ldquo;Heaven forbid,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that
      I should expose any man to your Majesty&rsquo;s resentment without cause. The
      wrath of kings is the forerunner of death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not heard,&rdquo; the king answered, drily, &ldquo;that the Duke of Bouillon
      has called in a leech yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before retiring I learned that his Majesty had with him a score of light
      horse, whom La Varenne had requisitioned from Melun, and that some of
      these had each day awaited him at Malesherbes, and returned with him.
      Further, that Henry had been in the habit of wearing, when riding back in
      the evening, a purple cloak over his hunting-suit; a fact well known, I
      felt sure, to the assassins, who, unseen and in perfect safety, could fire
      at the exact moment when the cloak obscured the feather, and could then
      make their escape, secured by the stout wall of box, from immediate
      pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was aroused in the morning by La Varenne coming to my bedside and
      bidding me hasten to the king. I did so, and found his Majesty already in
      his boots and walking on the terrace with Coquet, his master of the
      household, Vitry, La Varenne, and a gentleman unknown to me. On seeing me
      he dismissed them, and, while I was still a great way off, called out,
      chiding me for my laziness; then taking me by the hand in the most
      obliging manner, he made me walk up and down with him, while he told me
      what further thoughts he had of this affair; and, hiding nothing from me,
      even as he bade me speak to him whatever I thought without reserve, he
      required to know whether I suspected that the Entragues family were
      cognizant of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say, sire,&rdquo; I answered, prudently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you suspect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your Majesty&rsquo;s cause I suspect all,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed, and seeing that my eyes wandered to the group of gentlemen who
      had betaken themselves to the terrace steps, and were thence watching us,
      he asked me if I would answer for them. &ldquo;For Vitry, who sleeps at my feet
      when I lie alone? For Coquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For three of them I will, sire,&rdquo; I answered, firmly. &ldquo;The fourth I do not
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is M. Louis d&rsquo;Entragues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! the count of Auvergne&rsquo;s half-brother?&rdquo; I muttered. &ldquo;And lately
      returned from service in Savoy? I do not know him, your Majesty. I will
      answer to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to-day?&rdquo; the king asked, with impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon I begged him to act as he had done each day since his arrival at
      Fontainebleau&mdash;to hunt in the morning, to take his midday meal at
      Malesherbes, to talk to all as if he had no suspicion; only on his return
      to take any road save that which passed the Rock of the Serpents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king turning to rejoin the others, I found that their attention was no
      longer directed to us, but to a singular figure which had made its
      appearance on the skirts of the group, and was seemingly prevented from
      joining it outright only by the evident merriment with which three of the
      four courtiers regarded it. The fourth, M. d&rsquo;Entragues, did not seem to be
      equally diverted with the stranger&rsquo;s quaint appearance, nor did I fail to
      notice, being at the moment quick to perceive the slightest point in his
      conduct, that, while the others were nudging one another, his countenance,
      darkened by an Italian sun, gloomed on the new-comer with an aspect of
      angry discomfiture. On his side, M. de Boisrose&mdash;for he it was, the
      aged fashion of his dress more conspicuous than ever&mdash;stood eyeing
      the group in mingled pride and resentment, until, aware of his Majesty&rsquo;s
      approach, and seeing me in intimate converse with him, he joyfully stepped
      forward, a look of relief taking place of all others on his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, well met!&rdquo; quoth the king in my ear. &ldquo;It is your friend of yesterday.
      Now we will have some sport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, the old soldier approaching with many low bows, the king
      spoke to him graciously, and bade him say what he sought. It happened then
      as I had expected. Boisrose, after telling the king his name, turned to me
      and humbly begged that I would explain his complaint, which I consented to
      do, and did as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, sire,&rdquo; I said, gravely, &ldquo;is an old and brave soldier, who formerly
      served your Majesty to good purpose in Normandy; but he has been cheated
      out of the recompense which he there earned by the trickery and chicanery
      of one of your Majesty&rsquo;s counsellors, the Baron de Rosny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not continue, for the courtiers, on hearing this from my mouth,
      and on discovering that the stranger&rsquo;s odd appearance was but a prelude to
      the real diversion, could not restrain their mirth. The king, concealing
      his own amusement, turned to them with an angry air, and bade them be
      silent; and the Gascon, encouraged by this, and by the bold manner in
      which I had stated his grievance, scowled at them gloriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He alleges, sire,&rdquo; I continued, with the same gravity, &ldquo;that the Baron de
      Rosny, after promising him the government of Fecamp, bestowed it on
      another, being bribed to do so, and has besides been guilty of many base
      acts which make him unworthy of your Majesty&rsquo;s confidence. That, I think,
      is your complaint, M. de Boisrose?&rdquo; I concluded, turning to the soldier,
      whom my deep seriousness so misled that he took up the story, and, pouring
      out his wrongs, did not fail to threaten to trounce me, or to add that I
      was a villain!
    </p>
    <p>
      He might have said more, but at this the courtiers, perceiving that the
      king broke into a smile, lost all control over themselves, and, giving
      vent suddenly to loud peals of laughter, clasped one another by the
      shoulders, and reeled to and fro in an ecstasy of enjoyment. This led the
      king to give way also, and he laughed heartily, clapping me again and
      again on the back; so that, in fine, there were only two serious persons
      present&mdash;the poor Boisrose, who took all for lunatics, and myself,
      who began to think that perhaps the jest had been carried far enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      My master presently saw this, and, collecting himself, turned to the
      amazed Gascon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your complaint is one,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which should not be lightly made. Do
      you know the Baron de Rosny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boisrose, by this time vastly mystified, said he did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;I will give you an opportunity of becoming
      acquainted with him. I shall refer your complaint to him, and he will
      decide upon it. More,&rdquo; he continued, raising his hand for silence as
      Boisrose, starting forward, would have appealed to him, &ldquo;I will introduce
      you to him now. This is the Baron de Rosny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old soldier glared at me for a moment with starting eyeballs, and a
      dreadful despair seemed to settle on his face. He threw himself on his
      knees before the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sire,&rdquo; said he, in a heartrending voice, &ldquo;am I ruined! My six
      children must starve, and my young wife die by the roadside!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; answered the king, gravely, &ldquo;must be for the Baron de Rosny to
      decide. I leave you to your audience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a sign to the others, and, followed by them, walked slowly along
      the terrace; the while Boisrose, who had risen to his feet, stood looking
      after him like one demented, shaking, and muttering that it was a cruel
      jest, and that he had bled for the king, and the king made sport of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently I touched him on the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, have you nothing to say to me, M. de Boisrose?&rdquo; I asked, quietly.
      &ldquo;You are a brave soldier, and have done France service; why then need you
      fear? The Baron de Rosny is one man, the king&rsquo;s minister is another. It is
      the latter who speaks to you now. The office of lieutenant-general of the
      ordnance in Normandy is empty. It is worth twelve thousand livres by the
      year. I appoint you to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered that I mocked him, and that he was going mad, so that it was
      long before I could persuade him that I was in earnest. When I at last
      succeeded, his gratitude knew no bounds, and he thanked me again and again
      with the tears running down his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I have done for you,&rdquo; I said, modestly, &ldquo;is the reward of your
      bravery. I ask only that you will not another time think that they who
      rule kingdoms are as those gay popinjays yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a transport of delight he reiterated his offers of service, and,
      feeling sure that I had now gained him completely, I asked him on a sudden
      where he had seen Louis d&rsquo;Entragues before. In two words the truth came
      out. He had observed him on the previous day in conference at the forest
      inn with the three bullies whom I had remarked there. I was not surprised
      at this; D&rsquo;Entragues&rsquo;s near kinship to the Count of Auvergne, and the
      mingled feelings with which I knew that the family regarded Henry,
      preparing me to expect treachery in that quarter. Moreover, the nature of
      the ambush was proof that its author resided in the neighbourhood and was
      intimately acquainted with the forest. I should have carried this
      information at once to my master, but I learned that he had already
      started, and thus baffled, and believing that his affection for
      Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Entragues, if not for her sister, would lead him to act
      with undue leniency, I conceived and arranged a plan of my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      About noon, therefore, I set out as if for a ride, attended by La Trape
      only, but at some distance from the palace we were joined by Boisrose,
      whom I had bidden to be at that point well armed and mounted. Thus
      reinforced, for the Gascon was still strong, and in courage a Grillon, I
      proceeded to Malesherbes by a circuitous route which brought me within
      sight of the gates about the middle of the afternoon. I then halted under
      cover of the trees, and waited until I saw the king, attended by several
      ladies and gentlemen, and followed by eight troopers, issue from the
      chateau. His Majesty was walking, his horse being led behind him; and
      seeing this I rode out and approached the party as if I had that moment
      arrived to meet the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not ill become me on this occasion to make some reflections on
      the hollowness of court life, which has seldom been better exemplified
      than in the scene before me. The sun was low, but its warm beams, falling
      aslant on the gaily dressed group at the gates and on the flowered
      terraces and gray walls behind them, seemed to present a picture at once
      peaceful and joyous. Yet I knew that treachery and death were lurking in
      the midst, and it was only by an effort that, as I rode up, I could make
      answer to the thousand obliging things with which I was greeted, and of
      which not the least polite were said by M. d&rsquo;Entragues and his son. I took
      pains to observe Mademoiselle Susette, a beautiful girl not out of her
      teens, but noways comparable, as it seemed to me, in expression and
      vivacity, with her famous sister. She was walking beside the king, her
      hands full of flowers, and her face flushed with excitement and timidity,
      and I came quickly to the conclusion that she knew nothing of what was
      intended by her family, who, having made the one sister the means of
      gratifying their avarice, were now baiting the trap of their revenge with
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry parted from her at length, and mounted his horse amid a ripple of
      laughter and compliments, D&rsquo;Entragues holding the stirrup and his son the
      cloak. I observed that the latter, as I had expected, was prepared to
      accompany us, which rendered my plan more feasible. Our road lay for a
      league in the direction of the Rock of the Serpents, the track which
      passed the latter presently diverging from it. For some distance we rode
      along in easy talk, but, on approaching the point of separation, the king
      looked at me with a whimsical air, as though he would lay on me the burden
      of finding an excuse for avoiding the shorter way home. I had foreseen
      this, and looked round to ascertain the position of our company. I found
      that La Varenne and D&rsquo;Entragues were close behind us, while the troopers,
      with La Trape and Boisrose, were a hundred paces farther to the rear, and
      Vitry and Coquet had dropped out of sight. This being so, I suddenly
      reined in my horse so as to back it into that of D&rsquo;Entragues, and then
      wheeled round on the latter, taking care to be between him and the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Louis d&rsquo;Entragues,&rdquo; I said, dropping the mask and addressing him with
      all the scorn and detestation which I felt, and which he deserved, &ldquo;your
      plot is discovered! If you would save your life confess to his Majesty
      here and now all you know, and throw yourself on his mercy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I confess that I had failed to take into account the pitch to which his
      nerves would be strung at such a time, and had expected to produce a
      greater effect than followed my words. His hand went indeed to his breast,
      but it was hard to say which was the more discomposed, La Varenne or he.
      And the manner in which, with scorn and defiance, he flung back my
      accusation in my teeth, lacked neither vigour nor the semblance of
      innocence. While Henry was puzzled, La Varenne was appalled. I saw that I
      had gone too far, or not far enough, and at once calling into my face and
      form all the sternness in my power, I bade the traitor remain where he
      was, then turning to his Majesty I craved leave to speak to him apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated, looking from me to D&rsquo;Entragues with an air of displeasure
      which embraced us both, but in the end, without permitting M. Louis to
      speak, he complied, and, going aside with me, bade me, with coldness,
      speak out.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon, however, as I had repeated to him Boisrose&rsquo;s words, his face
      underwent a change, for he, too, had remarked the discomfiture which the
      latter&rsquo;s appearance had caused D&rsquo;Entragues in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! the villain!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I do not now think you precipitate. Arrest
      him at once, but do him no harm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he resist, sire?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not,&rdquo; the king answered. &ldquo;And in no case harm him! You understand
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bowed, having my own thoughts on the subject, and the king, without
      looking again at D&rsquo;Entragues, rode quickly away. M. Louis tried to follow,
      and cried loudly after him, but I thrust my horse in the way, and bade him
      consider himself a prisoner; at the same time requesting La Varenne, with
      Vitry and Coquet, who had come up and were looking on like men
      thunderstruck, to take four of the guards and follow the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sir, what do you intend to do with me?&rdquo; D&rsquo;Entragues asked, the air
      of fierceness with which he looked from me to the six men who remained
      barely disguising his apprehensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends, M. Louis,&rdquo; I replied, recurring to my usual tone of
      politeness, &ldquo;on your answers to three questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Ask them,&rdquo; he said, curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you deny that you have laid an ambush for the king on the road which
      passes the Rock of the Serpents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or that you were yesterday at an inn near here in converse with three
      men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you deny that there is such an ambush laid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; he repeated, with scorn. &ldquo;It is an old wives&rsquo; story. I would
      stake my life on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; I answered, slowly. &ldquo;You have been your own judge. The evening
      grows cold, and as you are my prisoner I must have a care of you. Kindly
      put on this cloak and precede me, M. d&rsquo;Entragues. We return to
      Fontainebleau by the Rock of the Serpents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes meeting mine, it seemed to me that for a second he held his
      breath and hesitated, while a cold shadow fell and dwelt upon his sallow
      face. But the stern, gloomy countenances of La Trape and Boisrose, who had
      ridden up to his rein, and were awaiting his answer with their swords
      drawn, determined him. With a loud laugh he took the cloak. &ldquo;It is new, I
      hope?&rdquo; he said, lightly, as he threw it over his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not, and I apologised, adding, however, that no one but the king
      had worn it. On this he settled it about him; and having heard me strictly
      charge the two guards who followed with their arquebuses ready, to fire on
      him should he try to escape, he turned his horse&rsquo;s head into the path and
      rode slowly along it, while we followed a few paces behind in double file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had set, and such light as remained fell cold and gray between the
      trees. The crackling of a stick under a horse&rsquo;s hoof, or the ring of a
      spur against a scabbard, were the only sounds which broke the stillness of
      the wood as we proceeded. We had gone some little way when M. Louis
      halted, and, turning in his saddle, called to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. de Rosny,&rdquo; he said,&mdash;the light had so far failed that I could
      scarcely see his face,&mdash;&ldquo;I have a meeting with the Viscount de Caylus
      on Saturday about a little matter of a lady&rsquo;s glove. Should anything
      prevent my appearance&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see that a proper explanation is given,&rdquo; I answered, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or if M. d&rsquo;Entragues will permit me,&rdquo; eagerly exclaimed the Gascon, who
      was riding by my side, &ldquo;M. de Boisrose of St. Palais, gently born, through
      before unknown to him, I will appear in his place and make the Viscount de
      Caylus swallow the glove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will?&rdquo; said M. Louis, with politeness. &ldquo;You are a gentleman. I am
      obliged to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand with a gesture which I afterward well remembered, and,
      giving his horse the rein, went forward along the path at a brisk walk. We
      followed, and I had just remarked that a plant of box was beginning here
      and there to take the place of the usual undergrowth, when a sheet of
      flame seemed to leap out through the dusk to meet him, and, his horse
      rearing wildly, he fell headlong from the saddle without word or cry. My
      men would have sprung forward before the noise of the report had died
      away, and might possibly have overtaken one or more of the assassins; but
      I restrained them. When La Trape dismounted and raised the fallen man, the
      latter was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the circumstances, now for the first time made public, which
      attended the discovery of this, the least known, yet one of the most
      dangerous, of the many plots which were directed against the life of my
      master. The course which I adopted may be blamed by some, but it is enough
      for me that after the lapse of years it is approved by my conscience and
      by the course of events. For it was ever the misfortune of that great king
      to treat those with leniency whom no indulgence could win; and I bear with
      me to this day the bitter assurance that, had the fate which overtook
      Louis d&rsquo;Entragues embraced the whole of that family, the blow which ten
      years later cut short Henry&rsquo;s career would never have been struck.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
