<h3>I</h3>

<p>The most high gods have decided that too
much power over the hearts of men shall not be
given to other men, for then the givers are forgotten
in the gift and the smoke dies away from
the altars. So they kill the men who play with
souls. According to an ancient saying, before they
destroy the victim they make him mad. There are,
however, modifications of the process. Occasionally
they make him drunk.</p>

<p>As I came down the board-walk that leads to
the ocean, I saw by his staggering and swaying
gait that the man was not only very drunk indeed,
but that he gloried in the fact. This was shown
by his brandishing arms and tossing head and
the defiant air with which he regarded the cottages,
before one of which he paused, leaned forward,
placing one hand dramatically at his ear,
and presently executed a wild dance of what was
apparently derision. A timid woman would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
retreated, but I am not timid, except when I am
alone in the dark. Also I have what my brother-in-law
calls Bohemian tastes. As nearly as I have
been able to understand that phrase, it signifies
a great interest in people, especially when they
are at all odd. And this solitary, scornful dance
of a ragged man before the Averys' cottage was
odd in the extreme.</p>

<p>So I walked quietly along. When I reached the
man I heard him muttering rapidly to himself,
while he rested from the exertion of his late performance.
What did dancing drunken men talk
about? I walked slower. My brother-in-law says
that a woman with any respect for the proprieties,
to say nothing of the conventions, would never
have done this. I have observed, however, that his
feelings for the proprieties and the conventions,
both of them, have on occasion suffered relapse,
more especially at those times, prior to his marriage
to my sister, when I, although supposed to
be walking and riding and rowing and naphtha-launching
with them, was frequently and inexcusably
absent. So I gather that the proprieties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and the conventions, like many other things, are
relative.</p>

<p>As I passed the man he turned and looked
crossly at me and spoke apparently to some one far
away behind me, for he spoke with much force.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear such damn foolishness?" he
demanded. Now there was nothing to hear but
Miss Kitty Avery playing Chopin's Fourth Ballade
in F minor. She played it badly, of course,
but nobody who knew Kitty Avery would have
imagined that she would play otherwise than
badly, and I have heard so much bad playing that
I didn't notice it very much anyway. I thought
it hardly probable that the man should know how
unfortunate Kitty's method and selection were, so
I passed directly by. Soon I heard his steps, and
I knew he was coming after me. While he was
yet some distance behind me he spoke again.</p>

<p>"I suppose that fool of a woman thinks she can
play," he growled as he lurched against a lamp-post.
Then I did the unpardonable deed. I turned
and answered him.</p>

<p>"How do you know it's a woman?" I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Huh! Take me for a fool, don't you?" he said
scornfully, scuffling along unsteadily. "I'm drunk
as an owl, but I'm no fool! No. I know it's a
woman from the pawin' 'round she does. Bah!
Thinks she's playin'. Damn nonsense!" He sat
down carefully on the sand by the side of the walk
and wagged his head knowingly. I looked cautiously
about. No one was in sight. I bent down
and untied my shoe.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you could play it better?" I suggested
sweetly. His jaw dropped with consternation.</p>

<p>"Play it better! Oh, Lord! She says can I play
it better! Can-I-play-it-better? Well, I'll tell you
one thing. If I couldn't play it better, d'ye know
what I'd do? Do you?"</p>

<p>"No," said I, and tied my shoe. He didn't talk
thickly as they do in books. On the contrary, he
brought out each word with a particularly clear
and final utterance.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd go off and
drown my sorrers in drink! Yes, I would. Although
I'm so drunk that I wouldn't know when I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
getting drunk on principle and when I was just
plain drunk. Le' me tell you somethin': <i>I'm drunk
now!</i>" He announced the fact with a gravity so
colossal as to render laughter impossible. I untied
the other shoe.</p>

<p>"Can you really play Chopin?" I said. He
shook his fist at the Avery cottage.</p>

<p>"What I can't play of Chopin you never heard
played! So that's the end o' that," he said. The
folly of the situation suddenly became clear to me.
I hastily tied my shoe and turned to go. He half
rose from the sand, but sank helplessly back.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said confidentially, "I'm tired,
and I need m' rest. I got to have rest. We all need
rest. If you want to hear me play, you come to
the old hulk of a barn that's got the piano in it.
They call it the auditorium&mdash;au-di-to-ri-um." He
pronounced the syllables as if to a child of three.
"I'll be there. You come before supper. I'll be rested
then. I'd like to shoot that woman&mdash;thinks she
can play&mdash;damn nonsense&mdash;" I went on to the
beach.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>My brother-in-law came down on the afternoon
boat, and of course he occupied our attention. His
theories, though often absurd, are certainly well
sustained. For instance, his ideas as to the connection
between genius and insanity. He says&mdash;but
I don't know why I speak of it. I defeated
him utterly. At length I left the room. I hate a
man who won't give up when he's beaten. I found
the Nice Boy on the piazza, and we sat and talked.
Really a charming fellow. And not so very young,
either. He told fascinating tales of a shipwreck
he'd experienced, where they sat on the bow as the
boat went down and traded sandwiches.</p>

<p>"I gave Hunter two hams for a chicken, and
it was a mean swindle!" he said reminiscently.
"Speaking of sandwiches, I gave a chap ten cents
to buy one this afternoon. Awfully seedy looking.
Shabby clothes, stubbly beard, dirty hands,
not half sober, and what do you think he said?"
I remembered and blushed.</p>

<p>"I don't know," I murmured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
"He invited me to a recital&mdash;a piano recital!
He said he was going to play at five-thirty in the
auditorium, and I might come if I liked, though
it was a private affair! How is that for nerve? He
didn't look up to a hand organ."</p>

<p>My curiosity grew. And then, I had a great
consciousness of not liking to disappoint even a
drunken man. He evidently thought I was coming.
I sketched lightly to the Nice Boy the affair
of the morning. He was not shocked. He was
amused. But my brother-in-law says that nothing
I could say could shock the Nice Boy. In fact, he
says, that if I mean nothing serious, I have no
business to let the Nice Boy think&mdash;but that is a
digression. It is one of my brother-in-law's prerogatives
to be as impertinent as he cares to be.</p>

<p>"Shall we go over?" said I. "He is very probably
an accompanist, stranded here, with his engagement
ended. Perhaps he even plays well.
These things happen in books." The Nice Boy
shook his head.</p>

<p>"We'll go, by all means," he said, "but don't
hope. He's not touched a piano this long time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>So we gathered some shawls and cushions and
went over. The building was all dusty and smelled
of pine. As we stumbled in, the sound of a piano
met us. I own I was a bit excited. For one doubtful
second I listened, ready to adore. Then I
laughed nervously. We were not people in a book.
It was Mendelssohn's "Spring Song," played
rather slowly and with a mournful correctness. I
could feel the player's fingers thudding down on
the keys&mdash;one played it so when it was necessary
to use the notes. The Nice Boy smiled consolingly.</p>

<p>"Too bad," he whispered. "Shall we go out
now?"</p>

<p>"I should like to view the fragments of the
idol!" I whispered back. "Let's end the illusion
by seeing him!"</p>

<p>So we tip-toed up to the benches, and looked
at the platform where the Steinway stood.
Twirling on the stool sat a girl of seventeen
or so, peering out into the gloom at us. It was
very startling. Now I felt that the strain was yet
to come. As I sank into one of the chairs a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
rose slowly from a seat under the platform. It
was the stranger. He nodded jauntily at us.</p>

<p>"Good thing you come," he announced cheerfully.
"I don't know how long I could stand that
girl. I guess she's related to the other," and he
shambled up the steps. His unsteady walk, his shaking
hand, as he clumsily pushed the chairs out of
the way, told their disagreeable story. He walked
straight up to the girl, and looking beyond her,
said easily, "Excuse me, miss, but I'm goin' to play
a little for some friends o' mine, an' I'll have to ask
you to quit for a while." The girl looked undecidedly
from him to us, but we had nothing to
say.</p>

<p>"Come, come," he added impatiently, "you can
bang all you want in a few minutes, with nobody
to disturb you. Jus' now I'm goin' to do my own
turn."</p>

<p>His assurance was so perfect, his intention to
command obedience so evident, that the child got
up and went slowly down the stairs, more curious
than angry. The man swept the music from the
rack, and lifted the top of the piano to its full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
height. Then with an impatient twitch he spun the
music-stool a few inches lower, and pulled it out.
The Nice Boy leaned over to me.</p>

<p>"The preparations are imposing, anyhow," he
whispered. But I did not laugh. I felt nervous.
To be disappointed again would be too cruel! I
watched the soiled, untidy figure collapse onto
the stool. Then I shut my eyes, to hear without
prejudice of sight the opening triple-octave scale
of the professional pianist. For with such assurance
as he showed he should at least be able to
play the scales.</p>

<p>The hall seemed so large and dim, I was so
alone&mdash;I was glad of the Nice Boy. Suppose it
should all be a horrible plot, and the tramp should
rush down with a revolver? Suppose&mdash;and then I
stopped thinking. For from far-away somewhere
came the softest, sweetest song. A woman was singing.
Nearer and nearer she came, over the hills,
in the lovely early morning; louder and louder she
sang&mdash;and it was the "Spring Song"! Now she
was with us&mdash;young, clear-eyed, happy, bursting
into delicious flights of laughter between the bars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Her eyes, I know, were grey. She did not run or
leap&mdash;she came steadily on, with a swift, strong,
swaying, lilting motion. She was all odorous of the
morning, all vocal with the spring. Her voice
laughed even while she sang, and the perfect,
smooth succession of the separate sounds was unlike
any effect I have ever heard. Now she passed&mdash;she
was gone by. Softer, fainter, ah, she was
gone! No, she turned her head, tossed us flowers,
and sang again, turned, and singing, left us.
One moment of soft echo&mdash;and then it was still.</p>

<p>I breathed&mdash;for the first time since I heard her,
I thought. I opened my eyes. It was all black before
them, they had been closed so long. I did not
dare look at the Nice Boy. There was absolutely
nothing for him to say, but I was afraid he would
try to say it. He was staring at the platform. His
mouth was open, his eyes very large. Without
turning his face towards me, he said solemnly,
"And I gave him ten cents for a sandwich! Ten
cents for a sandwich!"</p>

<p>Suddenly I heard sobs&mdash;heavy, awkward sobs.
I looked behind me. The girl had dropped for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>ward
on to the chair in front and was hysterically
chattering into her handkerchief.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> played that! <i>I</i> played that!" she wailed. "Oh,
he heard me! he did, he did!" I felt horribly
ashamed for her. How she must feel! A child can
suffer so.</p>

<p>But the man at the piano gave a little chuckle
of satisfaction, and ran his hands up and down
the keys in a delirium of scales and arpeggios.
Then he hit heavily a deep, low note. It was like
a great, bass trumpet. A crashing chord: and
then the love-song of Germany and musicians
caught me up to heaven, or wherever people go
who love that tune&mdash;perhaps it is to Germany&mdash;and
I heard a great, magnificent man singing in a
great, magnificent baritone, the song that won
Clara Schumann's heart.</p>

<p>Schubert sang sweetly, wonderfully. I cry like
a baby when one sings the Serenade even fairly
well. And dear Franz Abt has made most loving
melodies. But they were musicians singing, this
was a man. "<i>Du meine Liebe, du!</i>"&mdash;that was no
piano; it was a voice. And yet no human voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
could be at once so limpid and so rich, so thrilling
and so clear. And now it crashed out in chords&mdash;heavy,
broken harmony. All the rapture of possession,
the very absolute of human joy were there&mdash;but
these are words, and that was love and music.</p>

<p>I don't in the least know how long it lasted.
There was no time for me. The god at the piano
repeated it again and again, I think, as it is never
repeated in the singing, and always should be. I
know that the tears rolled over my cheeks and
dropped into my lap. I have a vague remembrance
of the Nice Boy's enthusiastically and brokenly
begging me to marry him to-night and go to Venice
with him to-morrow, and my ecstatically consenting
to that or anything else. I am sure he held
my hand during that period, for the rings cut in
so the next day. And I think&mdash;indeed I am quite
certain&mdash;but why consider one's self responsible for
such things? At any rate, it has never happened
since.</p>

<p>And when it was over we went up hand in hand,
and the Nice Boy said, "What&mdash;what is your&mdash;your
name?" And I stared at him, expecting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
see his dirty clothes drop off, and his trailing
clouds of glory wrap him 'round before he vanished
from our eyes. His heavy eyebrows bent together.
His knees shook the piano-stool. He was
labouring under an intense excitement. But I think
he was pleased at our faces.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what the devil does it matter to you
what I'm named?" he said roughly.</p>

<p>"Oh, it doesn't matter at all, not at all," I said
meekly; "only we wanted, we wanted&mdash;&mdash;" And
then, like that chit of seventeen, I cried, too. I am
such a fool about music.</p>

<p>"Now you know what I mean when I say I can
play," he growled savagely. He seemed really terribly
excited, even angry. "I'll play one thing
more. Then you go home. When I think o' what
I might have done, great God, I can't die till I've
shown 'em! Can I? Can I die? You hear me! You
see"&mdash;his face was livid. His eyes gleamed like
coals. I ought to have been afraid, but I wasn't.</p>

<p>"You shall show them!" I gasped. "You shall!
Will you play for the hotel? We can fill this place
for you. We can&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you shut up!" he snarled. "You! I've
played to thousands, I have. You don't know anything
about it. It's this devil's drink that's killin'
me. It ruined me in Vienna. It spoiled the whole
thing in Paris. It's goin' to kill me." His voice
rose to a shriek. He dropped from the stool, and
from his pocket fell a bottle. The Nice Boy gave
a queer little sob.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's dreadful, dreadful!" he whispered to
himself. He jumped up on the platform and seized
the man's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Come, come," he said. "We'll help you. Come,
be a man! You stay here with us, and we'll take
care of you. Such a gift as yours shall not go for
nothing. Come over to the hotel, and I'll get you
a bed."</p>

<p>The man staggered up. He was much older
than I had thought. There were deep, disagreeable
lines in his face. There was a coarseness, too&mdash;but,
oh, that "Spring Song"! Now, how can
that be? My brother-in-law says&mdash;but this is not
his story. The man got onto the seat somehow.</p>

<p>"You're a decent fellow," he said. "When I've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
done playing, you go out. Right straight out.
D'ye hear? I'll come see you to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>Then he shut his eyes and felt for the keys,
and played the Chopin Berceuse. And it is an
actual fact that I wanted to die then. Not suddenly&mdash;but
just to be rocked into rest, rocked into
rest, and not wake up any more. It was the purest,
sweetest, most inexpressibly touching thing I ever
heard. I felt so young&mdash;so trustful, somehow. I
knew that no harm would come. And then it sang
itself to sleep, and we went away and left him,
with his head resting on his hands that still pressed
the keys. And we never spoke. I think the girl
came out with us, but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>At the door the Nice Boy gulped, and said in a
queer, shaky voice, "I'm not nearly good enough to
have sat by you&mdash;I know that&mdash;you seem so far
away&mdash;but I want to tell you." And I said that he
was much better than I&mdash;that none of us were good&mdash;that
I thought it would be all right in the end&mdash;that
after all it was being managed better
than we could arrange it&mdash;that perhaps heaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
was more like what we used to think than what
we think now. There is no knowing what we might
have said if my brother-in-law had not come down
to see where I was. And then I went to sleep like
a baby.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>I should like to end the story here. I should
like to leave him bowed over the keys and remember
only the most exquisite experience of my life
in connection with him. But there is the rest of
the tale, and it really needs telling.</p>

<p>I didn't see the end. The Nice Boy and my
brother-in-law saw that, and I only know as much
as they will tell me. The Nice Boy went over and
got him the next morning. He said his name was
Decker. He said that he had spent the night in
the solemnest watching and praying, and he had
held the bottle in his hands and never touched a
drop of it. They gave him a bath and clothes, and
fed him steadily for two days. He grew fat before
our eyes. He looked nicer, more respectable, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
more commonplace. He refused to touch the
piano, because it gave him such a craving for
drink.</p>

<p>He hated to talk about himself. But he let slip
occasional remarks about London and Paris and
Vienna and Leipsic that took away one's breath.
He must have known strange people. Once he told
me a little story about Clara Schumann that implied
more than acquaintance, and he quoted Liszt
constantly. He was an American beyond a doubt,
we thought. He spoke vaguely of a secret that
even Liszt had missed. I guessed it was connected
with that wonderful singing quality that made
the instrument a human voice under his fingers.
When I asked him about it he laughed.</p>

<p>"You wait," he said confidently. "You just
wait. I'll show you people something to make you
open your eyes. I know. You're a good audience,
you and your friend. You make a good air to
play in. You just wait."</p>

<p>And I have waited. But never again shall I hear
that lovely girl sing across the hills. Never again
will my heart grow big, and ache and melt, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
slip away to that song, "Du, Meine Leibe, Du."
Oh, it was not of this earth, that music. Perhaps
when I die I shall hear the Berceuse echo&mdash;I think
it may be so.</p>

<p>Well, we got them all together. There must have
been a thousand. They came from across the bay
and all along the inlet. The piano was tuned, and
the people were seated, and I was just where we
were that night, and Mr. Decker was walking behind
the little curtain in a new dress-suit. He had
shaken hands with me just before. His hands were
cold as ice and they trembled in mine. I congratulated
him on the presence of Herr H&mdash;&mdash; from
Leipsic, who had been miraculously discovered just
across the bay; and Mr. J&mdash;&mdash; of New York, who
could place him musically in the most desirable
fashion; and asked him not to forget me, his
first audience, and his most sincere friend and
admirer.</p>

<p>In his eyes I could swear I saw fright. Not nervousness,
not stage fear, but sheer, appalling terror.
It could not be, I thought, and my brother-in-law
told me to go down. Then he stepped to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the front and told them all how pleased, how
proud and delighted he was to be the means of
introducing to them one whom he confidently
trusted would leave this stage to-night one of the
recognised pianists of the world. He described
briefly the man's extraordinary effect upon two of
his friends, who were not, he was good enough to
say, likely to be mistaken in their musical estimates.
He hoped that they all appreciated their
good fortune in being the first people in this part
of the world to hear Mr. Decker, and he took great
pleasure in introducing him.</p>

<p>At this point Mr. Decker should have come forward.
As he did not, my brother-in-law stepped
back to get him. He found the Nice Boy alone in
the room behind the stage, looking distinctly nervous.
He explained that Mr. Decker had gone out
for a moment to get the air&mdash;he was naturally a
bit excited, and the room was close. My brother-in-law
said nothing, and they waited a few minutes
in strained silence. Finally they walked about
the room looking at each other.</p>

<p>"Do you think it was quite wise to let him go?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
said my brother-in-law, with compressed lips. The
Nice Boy is horribly afraid of my brother-in-law.</p>

<p>"I'll&mdash;I'll go out and&mdash;and get him," he
gasped, and dashed out into the dark, cursing
himself for a fool. This was unfortunate, for in
five seconds more Mr. Decker had reeled into the
room. He explained in a very thick voice that he
had never been able to play without the drink;
that a little brandy set his fingers free, but that
he had taken too much and must rest.</p>

<p>When the Nice Boy got back&mdash;he had brought
two great pails of cold water and a fresh dress-shirt&mdash;it
was too late. The man lay in a heap on
the floor, and my brother-in-law stood, white and
raging, talking to the heap. The man was drunkenly,
horribly asleep. The Boy said that the worst
five minutes he ever spent were those in which he
poured water over the heap on the floor and shook
it, my brother-in-law watching with an absolutely
indescribable expression!</p>

<p>Then he got out on the platform and said something.
Mr. Decker had met with an accident&mdash;would
some one get a doctor?&mdash;was there perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
a doctor in the audience?&mdash;they could realise his
position&mdash;and more of that sort.</p>

<p>I knew well enough. When the doctor went in
he found the Boy shaking the drunken brute on
the floor, and they told the doctor all about it,
and then went out by the other door. And they
got a carriage and took Decker to the hotel.</p>

<p>I don't know&mdash;it seemed not wholly his fault.
And his face showed that he had suffered. But
the men would hear nothing of that. My brother-in-law
says that for a woman who is really as
hard as nails I have more apparent and sthetic
sympathy than any one he ever knew. And that
may be so.</p>

<p>The people took it very nicely. They cleared
the floor, and the younger ones danced and the
older ones talked, and the manager sent over ices
and coffee, and it turned out the affair of the
season. And they were all very grateful to my
brother-in-law and his friend, and quite forgot
about the strange artist.</p>

<p>Whether he ever fully realised what the evening
had been we never knew, because when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
went in the next morning to see how he was, they
found him dead. The doctor said that the excitement,
the terror, the sudden cutting off of
liquor, with the sudden wild drinking, were too
much for an overstrained heart, and that he had
probably died soon after he was carried to his
room.</p>

<p>It seemed to me a little sad that while they were
dancing, the man whom they had come to see&mdash;&mdash;. But
my brother-in-law says that I turn to the
morbid view of things, and that that was the very
blessing of the whole affair&mdash;that the crowd
should have been so pleased, and that the horrible
situation should have ended so smoothly. Because
such a man is better dead, he says. And of
course he is right. Life would be horrible to him,
one can see.</p>

<p>But I have noticed that the Nice Boy and the
girl who heard him play do not feel so sure that
his death was best. For myself, I shall always feel
that the world has lost its musical master. I have
heard the music-makers of two generations, and
not one of them has excelled his exquisite light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>ness
and force of touch, and that wonderful singing
stress&mdash;oh! I could cry to think of it! And
when we go abroad next I shall find out the name
of the man who played in Leipsic and Paris and
Vienna&mdash;for he must have played there once; he
said he had played to thousands&mdash;and see if any
one there has heard of his secret, his wonderful
singing through the keys.</p>

<p>For, though my brother-in-law says that the
musical temperament in combination with a Bohemian
tendency gives an emotional basis which
is absolutely unsafe and therefore untrustworthy
in its reports of actual facts, I know that the most
glorious music of my life gained nothing from my
imagination. For there were three of us who saw
the spring come over the hills that night. Three
of us heard the triumph-song of love incarnate,
and thrilled to it. Three of us knew for once a
peace that passed our understanding, and had
the comfort of little children in their mother's
arms.</p>

<p>And though it is not true, as my brother-in-law
insinuates, that a man need only be able to play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
my soul away in order to be ranked by me among
the angels, I shall continue to insist that somewhere,
somehow, the beautiful sounds he made are
accounted to him for just a little righteousness!</p>

<h2 id="A_WIND_FLOWER">A WIND FLOWER</h2></div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Willard's landlady smiled sympathetically
across the narrow breakfast-table. "I guess you've
got to stay in this mornin', Mr. Willard," she said.
"It's a good deal too raw and cold for you to be
out around, paintin', to-day."</p>

<p>Willard nodded. "Quite right, Mrs. Storrs," he
returned, and he smiled at his landlady's daughter,
who sat opposite. But she did not smile at him.
She continued her silent meal, looking for the most
part at her plate, and replying to direct questions
only by monosyllables.</p>

<p>She must be nineteen or twenty, he decided, but
her slender, curveless figure might have been that
of a girl several years younger. Her face was
absolutely without character to the casual glance&mdash;pale,
slightly freckled, lighted by grey-green,
half-closed eyes, and framed in light brown hair.
Her lips were thin, and her rare smile did not dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>close
her teeth. Even her direct look, when he compelled
it, was quite uninterested.</p>

<p>Her mother chattered with volubility of a woman
left much alone, and glad of an appreciative listener,
but the girl had not, of her own accord,
spoken a word during his week's stay. He wondered
as he thought of it why he had not noticed
it before, and decided that her silence was not obtrusive,
but only the outcome of her colourless
personality&mdash;like the silence of the prim New England
house itself.</p>

<p>He groaned inwardly. "What in time <i>can</i> I do?
Nothing to read within five miles: my last cigar
gone yesterday: this beastly weather driving me to
melancholia! If she weren't such a stick&mdash;heavens!
I never knew a girl could be so thin!"</p>

<p>The girl in question rose and began clearing
the table. Her mother bustled out of the room, and
left Willard in the old-fashioned arm-chair by the
window, almost interested, as he wondered what the
girl would do or say now. After five minutes of
silence he realised the strange impression, or rather
the lack of impression, she made on him. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
hardly conscious of a woman's presence. The intangible
atmosphere of femininity that wraps
around a <i>tte--tte</i> with even the most unattractive
woman was wholly lacking. She seemed simply
a more or less intelligent human being.</p>

<p>Given greatly to analysis, he grew interested.
Why was this? She was not wanting intellectually,
he was sure. Such remarks as she had made in
answer to his own were not noticeable for stupidity
or even stolidity of thought. He broke the
silence.</p>

<p>"What do you do with yourself, these days?"
he suggested. "I don't see you about at all. Are
you reading, or walking about these fascinating
Maine beaches?"</p>

<p>She did not even look up at him as she replied.
"I don't know as I do very much of anything.
I'm not very fond of reading&mdash;at least, not these
books."</p>

<p>Remembering the "Pilgrim's Progress," "Book
of Martyrs," "Mrs. Heman's Poems," and the
"Adventures of Rev. James Hogan, Missionary
to the Heathen of Africa," that adorned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
marble-topped table in the parlour, he shuddered
sympathetically.</p>

<p>"But I walk a good deal," she volunteered. "I've
been all over that ledge you're painting."</p>

<p>"Isn't it beautiful?" he said. "It reminds me of
a poem I read somewhere about the beauty of
Appledore&mdash;that's on this coast somewhere, too,
isn't it? You'd appreciate the poem, I'm sure&mdash;do
you care for poetry?"</p>

<p>She piled the dishes on a tray, and carried it
through the door before he had time to take it
from her.</p>

<p>"No," she replied over her shoulder, "no, I don't
care for it. It seems so&mdash;so smooth and shiny,
somehow."</p>

<p>"Smooth? shiny?" he smiled as she came back,
"I don't see."</p>

<p>Her high, rather indifferent voice fell in a slight
embarrassment, as she explained: "Oh, I mean the
rhymes and the verses&mdash;they're so even and like a
clock ticking."</p>

<p>He took from his pocket a little red book. "Let
me read you this," he said eagerly, "and see if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
you think it smooth and shiny. You must have
heard and seen what this man tries to tell."</p>

<p>She stood awkwardly by the table, her scant,
shapeless dress accentuating the straight lines of
her slim figure, her hands clasped loosely before
her, her face turned toward the window, which
rattled now and then at the gusts of the rising
wind. Willard held the little book easily between
thumb and finger, and read in clear, pleasant tones,
looking at her occasionally with interest:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"<i>Fresh from his fastnesses, wholesome and spacious,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>The north wind, the mad huntsman, halloos on his white hounds</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Over the gray, roaring reaches and ridges,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>The forest of Ocean, the chase of the world.</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Hark to the peal of the pack in full cry,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>As he thongs them before him, swarming voluminous,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Weltering, wide-wallowing, till in a ruining</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Chaos of energy, hurled on their quarry,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>They crash into foam!</i>"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>"There! is that smooth and shiny?" he demanded.
She had moved nearer, to catch more certainly
his least intonation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Her hands twisted nervously, and to his surprise
she smiled with unmistakable pleasure.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" she half whispered, eyeing the book in
his hand wistfully. "Oh, no! That makes me feel
different. I&mdash;I love the wind."</p>

<p>"What's that?" Mrs. Storrs entered quickly.
"Now, Sarah, you just stop that nonsense! Mr.
Willard, has she been tellin' you any foolishness?"</p>

<p>"Miss Storrs had only told me that she liked
the wind," he replied, hoping that the woman
would go, and let him develop at leisure what
promised to be a most interesting situation. She
had really very pretty, even teeth, and when she
smiled her lips curved pleasantly.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Storrs was not to be evaded. She had
evidently a grievance to set forth, and looking
reproachfully at her daughter, continued:</p>

<p>"Ever since Sarah was five or six years old she's
had that crazy likin' for the wind. 'Tain't natural,
I say, and when the gales that we hev up here strike
us, the least anybody can do 's to stay in the house
and thank Providence they've got a house to stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
in! Why, Mr. Willard, you'd never think it to
look at her, for she's a real quiet girl&mdash;too quiet,
seems to me, sometimes, when I'm just put to it
for somebody to be social with&mdash;but in thet big
gale of eighty-eight she was out all night in it,
and me and her father&mdash;that was before Mr.
Storrs died&mdash;nearly crazy with fearin' she was lost
for good. And when she was six years old, she
got up from her crib and went out on the beach
in her little nightgown, and nothin' else, and it's
a miracle she didn't die of pneumonia, if not of
bein' blown to death."</p>

<p>Mrs. Storrs stopped for breath, and Willard
glanced at the girl, wondering if she would appear
disconcerted or angry at such unlooked-for
revelation of her eccentricity; but her face had
settled into its usual impassive lines, and she dusted
the chairs serenely, turning now and then to look
fixedly through the window at the swaying elm
whose boughs leaned to the ground under the still
rising wind.</p>

<p>Her mother was evidently relieving the strain
of an enforced silence, and sitting stiffly in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
chair, as one not accustomed to the luxury of idle
conversation, she continued:</p>

<p>"And even now, when she's old enough to know
better, you'd think, she acts possessed. Any wind-storm
'll set her off, but when the spring gales
come, she'll just roam 'round the house, back and
forth, staring out of doors, and me as nervous
as a cat all the while. Just because I won't let
her go out she acts like a child. Why, last year
I had to go out and drag her in by main force;
I was nearly blown off the cliff gettin' her
home. And she was singin', calm, as if she
was in her bed like any decent person! It's the
most unnatural thing I ever heard of! Now,
Sarah Storrs," as the girl was slipping from the
room, "you remember you promised me not to go
out this year after supper, if the wind was
high. You mind, now! It's comin' up an awful
blow."</p>

<p>The girl turned abruptly. "I never promised
you that, mother," she said quickly. "I said I
wouldn't if I could help it, and if I can't help it,
I can't, and that's all there is to it." The door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
closed behind her, and shortly afterwards Willard
left Mrs. Storrs in possession of the room.</p>

<p>The day affected him strangely. The steady
low moan of the wind was by this time very noticeable.
It was not cold, only clear and rather keen,
and the scurrying grey clouds looked chillier than
one found the air on going out. The boom of the
surf carried a sinister threat with it, and the birds
drove helplessly with the wind-current, as if escaping
some dreaded thing behind them.</p>

<p>Indoors, the state of affairs was not much better:
Mrs. Storrs looked injured; her sister, a lady of
uncertain years and temper, talked of sudden
deaths, and the probability of premature burial,
pointed by the relation of actual occurrences of
that nature; Sarah was not to be seen. At last he
could bear idleness no longer, and opening the
dusty melodeon, tried to drown the dreary minor
music of the wind by some cheerful selection from
the hymn-book Mrs. Storrs brought him, having
a vague idea that secular music was out of keeping
with the character of that instrument. After
a few moments' aimless fingering the keys he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
himself pedalling a laborious accompaniment to
the "Dead March" from Saul, and closed the
wheezy little organ in despair.</p>

<p>The long day dragged somehow by, and at
supper Sarah appeared, if anything, whiter and
more uninteresting than ever, only to retire immediately
when the meal was over.</p>

<p>"I might's well tell you, Mr. Willard, that you
c'n give up all hope of paintin' any more this
week," announced Mrs. Storrs, as the door closed
behind her daughter. "This wind's good for a
week, I guess. I'm sorry to have you go, but I
shouldn't feel honest not to tell you." Mentally
vowing to leave the next morning, Willard thanked
her, and explained that the study was far enough
advanced to be completed at his studio in the city,
and that he had intended leaving very shortly.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>A few moments later, as he stood at the window
in the parlour, looking at the waving elm-boughs
and lazily wondering how the moon could be so
bright when there were so many clouds, the soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
swish of a woman's skirt sounded close to his ear.
As he turned, the frightened "Oh!" and the little
gasp of surprised femininity revealed Sarah, standing
near the table in the centre of the room. Even
at that distance and in the dark he was aware of
a difference in her, a subtle element of personality
not present before.</p>

<p>"Did I frighten you?" he asked, coming nearer.</p>

<p>"No, not very much. Only I thought nobody
would be here. I&mdash;I&mdash;wanted some place to breathe
in; it seems so tight and close in the house." As
she spoke, a violent blast of wind drove the shutters
against the side of the house and rubbed together
the branches of the elm until they creaked
dismally. She pressed her face against the glass
and stared out into the dark.</p>

<p>"Don't you love it?" she questioned, almost
eagerly.</p>

<p>Willard shook his head dubiously. "Don't know.
Looks pretty cool. If it gets much higher, I
shouldn't care to walk far."</p>

<p>She took her old place by the table again, but
soon left it, and wandered restlessly about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
room. As she passed him he was conscious of a
distinct physical impression&mdash;a kind of electric
presence. She seemed to gather and hold about her
all the faint light of the cold room, and the sweep
of her skirt against his foot seemed to draw him
toward her. Suddenly she stopped her irregular
march.</p>

<p>"Hear it sing!" she whispered.</p>

<p>The now distinct voice of the wind grew to a
long, minor wail, that rose and fell with rhythmic
regularity. As she paused with uplifted finger near
him, Willard felt with amazement a compelling
force, a personality more intense, for the time, than
his own. Then, as the blast, with a shriek that
echoed for a moment with startling distinctness
from every side, dashed the elm branches against
the house itself, she turned abruptly and left the
room. "Stay here!" she said shortly, and, resisting
the impulse to follow her, he obeyed. In a few moments
she returned with a heavy shawl wrapped
over her head and shoulders.</p>

<p>"Hold the window open for me," she said, "I'm
going out." He attempted remonstrance, but she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
waved him impatiently away. "I can't get out of
the door&mdash;mother's locked it and taken the key,
but you can hold up the window while I get out.
Oh, come yourself, if you like! But nothing can
happen to me."</p>

<p>Mechanically he held open the window as she
slipped out, and, dragging his overcoat after him,
scrambled through himself. She was waiting for
him at the corner of the house, and as he stumbled
in the unfamiliar shadows, held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Here, take hold of my hand," she commanded.
Her cool, slim grasp was strangely pleasant, as
she hurried along with a smooth, gliding motion,
wholly unlike her indifferent gait of the day before.</p>

<p>Once out of the shelter of the house, the storm
struck them with full force, and Willard realised
that he was well-nigh strangled in the clutches of
a genuine Maine gale.</p>

<p>"What folly!" he gasped, crowding his hat
over his eyes and struggling to gain his wonted
consciousness of superiority. "Come back instantly,
Miss Storrs! Your mother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come! come!" she interrupted, pulling him
along.</p>

<p>He stared at her in amazement. Her eyes were
wide open and almost black with excitement. Her
face gleamed like ivory in the cold light. Her lips
were parted and curved in a happy smile. Her
slender body swayed easily with the wind that
nearly bent Willard double. She seemed unreal&mdash;a
phantom of the storm, a veritable wind-spirit.
Her loosened hair flew across his face, and its touch
completed the strange thrill that her hand-clasp
brought. He followed unresistingly.</p>

<p>"Aren't&mdash;you&mdash;afraid&mdash;of&mdash;the&mdash;woods?" he
gasped, the gusts tearing the words from his lips,
as he saw that she was making for the thick growth
of trees that bordered the cliff. Her high, light
laughter almost frightened him, so weird and unhuman
it came to him on the wind.</p>

<p>"Why should I be afraid? The woods are so
beautiful in a storm! They bow and nod and throw
their branches about&mdash;oh, they're best of all,
then!"</p>

<p>A sweeping blast nearly threw him down, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
he instinctively dropped her hand, since there was
no possible feeling of protection for her, her footing
was so sure, her balance so perfect. As he
righted himself and staggered to the shelter of
the tree under which she was standing, he stopped,
lost in wonder and admiration. She had impatiently
thrown off the shawl and stood in a gleam
of moonlight under the tree. Her long, straight
hair flew out in two fluttering wisps at either side;
her straight, fine brows, her dark, long lashes, her
slender, curved mouth were painted against her
pale face in clear relief. Her eyes were widely
open, the pupils dark and gleaming. It seemed to
his excited glance that rays of light streamed from
them to him. "Heavens! she's a beauty! If only
I could catch that pose!" he said under his
breath.</p>

<p>"Come!" she called to him again, "we're wasting
time! I want to get to the cliff!" He pressed
on to her, but she slipped around the tree and
eluded him, keeping a little in advance as he
panted on, fighting with all the force of a fairly
powerful man against the gale that seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
offer her no resistance. It occurred to him, as he
watched with a greedy artist's eye the almost unnatural
ease and lightness of her walk, that she
caught intuitively the turns of the wind, guiding
along currents and channels unknown to him, for
she seemed with it always, never against it. Once
she threw out both her arms in an abandon of
delight, and actually leaned on the gust that
tossed him against a tree, baffled and wearied with
his efforts to keep pace with her, and confusedly
wondering if he would wake soon from this improbable
dream.</p>

<p>Speech was impossible. The whistling of the
wind alone was deafening, and his voice was blown
in twenty directions when he attempted to call her.
Small twigs lashed his face, slippery boughs glided
from his grasp, and the trees fled by in a thick-grown
crowd to his dazed eyes. To his right, a
birch suddenly fell with a snapping crash. He
leaped to one side, only to feel about his face a
blinding storm of pattering acorns from the great
oak that with a rending sigh and swish tottered
through the air at his left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good God!" he cried in terror, as he saw her
standing apparently in its track. A veer in the
gale altered the direction of the great trunk, that
sank to the ground across her path. As it fell,
with an indescribable, swaying bound she leaped
from the ground, and before it quite touched the
earth she rested lightly upon it. She seemed absolutely
unreal&mdash;a dryad of the windy wood. All
fear for her left him. As she stood poised on the
still trembling trunk, a quick gust blew out her
skirt to a bubble on one side, and drove it close to
her slender body on the other, while her loose hair
streamed like a banner along the wind. She curved
her figure towards him and made a cup of one
hand, laying it beside her opened lips. What she
said he did not hear. He was rapt in delighted
wonder at the consummate grace of her attitude,
the perfect poise of her body. She was a figure
in a Greek frieze&mdash;a bas-relief&mdash;a breathing
statue.</p>

<p>Unable to make him hear, she turned slightly
and pointed ahead. He realised the effect of the
Wingless Victory in its unbroken beauty. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
not a woman, but an incarnate art, a miracle of
changing line and curve, a ceaseless inspiration.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard the pound and boom of the
surf. In an ecstasy of impatience she hurried back,
seized his hand, and fairly dragged him on. The
crash of the waves and the wind together took
from him all power of connected thought. He
clung to her hand like a child, and when she threw
herself down on her face to breathe, he grasped
her dress and panted in her ear: "We&mdash;can't&mdash;get&mdash;much&mdash;farther&mdash;unless&mdash;you&mdash;can&mdash;walk&mdash;the&mdash;Atlantic!"
She smiled happily back at
him, and the thickness of her hair, blown by the
wind from the ocean about his face, brought him
a strange, unspeakable content.</p>

<p>"Shall we ever go back?" he whispered, half to
himself. "Or will you float down the cliff and wake
me by your going?"</p>

<p>Her wide, dark eyes answered him silently. "It
is like a dream, though," her high, sweet voice
added. And then he realised that she had hardly
spoken since they left the house. The house? As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in a dream he tried vaguely to connect this Undine
of the wood with the girl whose body she had
stolen for this night's pranks. As in a dream he
rose and followed her back, through the howling,
sweeping wind. Her cold, slim hand held his; her
light, shrill voice sang little snatches of songs&mdash;hymns,
he remembered afterward. As the moonlight
fell on her, he wondered dreamily why he
had thought her too thin. And all the while he
fought, half-unconsciously, the resistless gale, that
spared him only when he yielded utterly.</p>

<p>The house gleamed white and square before
them. Silently he raised the window for her. He
had no thought of lifting her in. That she should
slip lightly through was of course. The house was
still lighted, and he heard the creaking of her
mother's rocking-chair in the bedroom over his
head. He looked at his watch. "Does her mother
rock all night?" he thought dully, for it was
nearly twelve. She read his question from the perplexed
glance he threw at her.</p>

<p>"She's sitting up to watch the door so that I
sha'n't get out," she whispered quietly, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
a smile. "Good-bye." And he stood alone in the
room.</p>

<p>Until late the next morning he wandered in
strange, wearied, yet fascinating dreams with her.
Vague sounds, as of high-pitched reproaches and
quiet sobbing, mingled with his morning dreams,
and when, with aching head and thoroughly bewildered
brain, he went to his late breakfast, Mrs.
Storrs served him; only as he left for the
train, possessed by a longing for the great, busy
city of his daily work, did he see her daughter,
walking listlessly about the house. Her freckled
face was paler than ever, her half-closed eyes reddened,
and her slight, awkward bow in recognition
of his puzzled salute might have been directed to
some one behind him. Only his aching head and
wearied feet assured him that the strangest night
of his life had been no dream.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>That his studio should seem bare and uninteresting
as he threw open the door, and tried to
kindle a fire in the dusty stove, did not surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
him. That the sketches and studies in colour should
look tame and flat to the eye that had been fed
for two weeks with Maine surf, angry clouds, and
swaying branches, was perhaps only natural. But
as the days went on and he failed to get in train
for work a puzzled wonder slowly grew in him.
Why was it that the picture dragged so? He remembered
perfectly the look of the beach, the feel
of the cold, hungry water, the heavy, grey clouds,
the primitive, forbidding austerity that a while
ago he had been so confidently eager to put on the
canvas. Why was it that he sat for hours together
helplessly staring at it? His friends supposed him
wrapped in his subject, working under a high
pressure, and considerately left him alone; they
would have marvelled greatly had they seen him
glowering moodily at the merest study of the subject
he had described so vividly to them, smoking
countless packages of cigarettes, hardly lifting his
hand from his chair-arm.</p>

<p>Once he threw down a handful of brushes and
started out for a tramp. It occurred to him that
the city sights and smells, the endless hum and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
roar, the rapid pace of the crowded streets would
tone him up and set his thoughts in a new line;
he was tired of the whistling gales and tossing
trunks and booming surf that haunted his nights
and confused his days. A block away from the
studio a flower-woman met him with a tray of
daffodils and late crocuses. A sudden puff of wind
blew out her scant, thin skirt; a tree in the centre
of the park they were crossing bent to it, the
branches creaked faintly. The fresh, earthy odour
of the flowers moved him strangely. He bought a
bunch, turned, and went back to the studio,
to sit for an hour gazing sightlessly ahead of
him.</p>

<p>Suddenly he started up and approached the
sketch.</p>

<p>"It wants wind," he muttered, half unconsciously,
and fell to work. An hour passed, two,
three&mdash;he still painted rapidly. Just as the light
was fading a thunderous knock at the door ushered
in the two men he knew best. He nodded vaguely,
and they crossed the room in silence and looked
at the picture. For a few moments no one spoke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Presently Willard took a brush from his mouth
and faced them.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said.</p>

<p>The older man shook his head. "Queer sky!"
he answered briefly.</p>

<p>The younger looked questioningly at Willard.
"You'll have to get a gait on you if you hope to
beat Morris with that," he said. "What's up,
Willard? Don't you want that prize?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do." His voice sounded dull, even
to himself. "You aren't any too sympathetic, you
fellows&mdash;&mdash;" he tried to feel injured.</p>

<p>The older man came nearer. "What's that white
thing there? Good Lord, Will, you're not going to
try a figure&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Willard brushed rapidly over the shadowy outline.
"No&mdash;that was just a sketch. The whole
thing's just a sort of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The whole thing's just a bluff!" interrupted
the younger man, decidedly. "It's not what you
told us about at all&mdash;and it's not good, anyway.
It looks as if a tornado had struck it! You said it
was to be late afternoon&mdash;it's nearer midnight, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
far as I can see! What's that tree lying around
for?"</p>

<p>His tone was abusive, but a genuine concern and
surprise was underneath it. He looked furtively at
his older friend behind Willard's back. The other
shook his head expressively.</p>

<p>Willard bit his lip. "I only wanted to try&mdash;it
won't necessarily stay that way," he explained.
He wished he cared more for what they said. He
wished they did not bore him so unspeakably.
More than all, he wished they would go.</p>

<p>The younger one whistled softly. "Pretty late
in the day to be making up your mind, I should
say," he remarked. "When's it going to dry
in? Morris has been working like a horse on his
for six weeks. He's coming on, too&mdash;splendid
colour!"</p>

<p>Willard lit a cigarette. "Damn Morris!" he said
casually. The older man drew on his glove and
turned to go.</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly!" he replied cheerfully. "By all
means! No, we can't stay&mdash;we only dropped in.
We just thought we'd see how you were getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
along. If I were you, Will, I'd make up my mind
about that intoxicated tree and set it up straight&mdash;good-bye!"</p>

<p>They went out cheerfully enough, but he knew
they were disappointed and hurt&mdash;they had expected
so much from that picture. And he wished
he cared more. He looked at it critically. Of course
it was bad, but how could they tell what he had
been doing? It was the plan of months changed
utterly in three hours. The result was ridiculous,
but he needed it no longer&mdash;he knew what he
wanted now, what he had been fighting against all
these days. He would paint it if he could&mdash;and
till he could. The insistent artist-passion to express
even bunglingly something of the unendurable
beauty of that strange night was on him,
and before the echo of his guests' departure had
died away he was working as he had never worked
before, the old picture lying unnoticed in the corner
where he had thrown it.</p>

<p>He needed no models, he did not use his studies.
Was it not printed on his brain, was it not etched
into his heart, that weird vision of the storm, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the floating fairy creature that hardly touched the
earth? Was there a lovely curve in all her melting
postures, which slipped like water circles into new
shapes, that he did not know? That haunting,
elf-like look, that ineffably exquisite <i>abandon</i>, had
he not studied it greedily then in the wood, and
later, in his restless dreams? The trees were sentient,
the bushes put out clasping fingers to detain
him, the wind shrieked out its angry soul at him;
and she, the white wonder with her floating wisps
of stinging hair, had joined with them to mock at
him, the startled witness of that mad revel of all
the elements. He knew all this&mdash;he was drunk with
it: could he paint it? Or would people see only a
strange-eyed girl dancing in a wood?</p>

<p>He did not know how many days he had been
at work on it; he ate what the cleaning-woman
brought him; his face was bristled with a stubby
growth; the cigarette boxes strewed the floor. Men
appeared at the door, and he urged them peevishly
to go away; people brought messages, and he said
he was not in town, and returned the notes unread.
In the morning he smiled and breathed hard and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
patted the easel; at night he bit his nails and
cursed himself for a colour-blind fool.</p>

<p>There was a white birch, strained and bent in
the wind, that troubled him still, and as he was
giving it the last touches, in the cold, strong afternoon
light, the door burst open.</p>

<p>"Look here, the thing closes at six! Are you
crazy?" they called to him, exasperatedly. "Aren't
you going to send it?"</p>

<p>"That's all right, that's all right," he muttered
vaguely, "shut up, can't you?"</p>

<p>They stood over behind him, and there was a
stillness in the room. He laid down his palette
carefully and turned to them, a worried look on
his drawn, bristled face.</p>

<p>"That's meant to be the ocean beyond the cliff
there," he said, an almost childlike fear in his eyes,
"did&mdash;did you know it?"</p>

<p>The older man drew in a long breath.</p>

<p>"Lord, yes! I hear it!" he returned, "do you
think we're deaf?"</p>

<p>The younger one squinted at various distances,
muttering to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dryad? Undine? No, she frightens you, but
she's sweet! George! He's painted the wind! He's
actually drawn a wind! My, but it's stunning!
My!"</p>

<p>Willard sank into a chair. He was flushed and
his legs shook. He patted the terrier unsteadily
and talked to her. "Well, then! Well, then! So
she was, iss, so she was!"</p>

<p>The older man snapped his watch. "Five-thirty,"
he said. "Put something 'round it, and
whistle a cab&mdash;we'll have to hurry!"</p>

<p>Willard fingered some dead crocuses on the
stand beside him. "Look out, you fool, it's wet!"
he growled. The older man patted his shoulder.</p>

<p>"All right, boy, all right!" he said soothingly.
"It's all done, now&mdash;never mind!"</p>

<p>They shouldered it out of the door while he
pulled the terrier's ears.</p>

<p>"Where you going?" they called.</p>

<p>"Turkish bath. Restaurant. Vaudeville," he answered,
and they nodded.</p>

<p>"All alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thanks. Drop in to-morrow!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;And drive like thunder!" he heard them
through the open window.</p>

<p>A week later he was walking up Broadway between
them, sniffing the fresh, sweet air comfortably,
the terrier at his heels. At intervals they
read him bits from the enthusiastic comments of
the critics.</p>

<p>"Mr. Willard, whose 'Windflower' distanced all
competitors and won the Minot prize by a unanimous
verdict of the judges, has displayed, aside
from his thorough master of technic, a breadth
of atmosphere, an imaginative range rarely if ever
equalled by an American. Nothing but the work
itself, so manifestly idealistic in subject and treatment,
could convince us that it is not a study from
life, so keen, so haunting is the impression produced
by the remarkable figure of the Spirit of
the Gale, who seems to sink before our eyes on the
falling trunk, literally riding the storm. In direct
contrast to this abandon of the figure is the admirable
reticence of the background which is keyed
so low&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Willard stopped abruptly before the window of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
a large art establishment where a photograph of
the picture was already displayed. "I want one
of those," he said, "and I'm going out into the
country for a bit before I sail, I think."</p>

<p>"Oh, back there?" they asked, comprehensively.</p>

<p>"Yes, back there!"</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>As the train rushed along he explained to himself
why he was going&mdash;why he had not merely
sent the photograph. He wanted to see her, to
brush away the cloud of illusion that the weeks
had spun around her. He wanted to realise definitely
the difference between the pale, silent, unformed
New England girl and the fascinating
personality of his picture. Ever since he left her
they had grown confused, these two that his common
sense told him were so different, and he was
beginning to dread the unavowed hope that for
him, at least, they might be some day one. The
same passionate power that had thrown mystery
and beauty into colour on the canvas wove sweet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
wild dreams around what he contemptuously told
himself was little better than a lay figure, but he
yielded to it now as he had then.</p>

<p>When he told himself that he was going purposely
to hear her talk, to see her flat, unlovely
figure, to appreciate her utter lack of charm, of
all vitality, he realised that it was a cruel errand.
But when he felt the sharp thrill that he suffered
even in anticipation as his quick imagination pictured
the dream-cloud dropping off from her, actually
before his eyes, he believed the journey more
than ever a necessary one.</p>

<p>As he walked up the little country street his
heart beat fast; the greening lawns, the fresh,
faint odours, the ageless, unnamable appeal of the
spring stirred his blood and thrilled him inexpressibly.
He was yet in the first flush of his success;
his whole nature was relaxed and sensitive to every
joy; he let himself drift on the sweet confused
expectancy, the delicious folly, the hope that he
was to find his dream, his inspiration, his spirit of
the wind and wood.</p>

<p>A child passed him with a great bunch of daf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>fodils
and stopped to watch him long after he had
passed, wondering at the silver in her hand.</p>

<p>At the familiar gate a tall, thin woman's figure
stopped his heart a second, and as a fitful gust
blew out her apron and tossed her shawl over her
head, he felt his breath come more quickly.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" he muttered, "what folly! Am
I never to see a woman's skirt blown without&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She put the shawl back as he neared her&mdash;it
was Mrs. Storrs's sister. She met his outstretched
hand with a blank stare. Suddenly her face
twitched convulsively.</p>

<p>"O Mr. Willard! O Mr. Willard!" she cried,
and burst into tears.</p>

<p>The wind blew sharper, the elm tree near the
window creaked, a dull pain grew in him.</p>

<p>"What is it? What's the matter?" he said
brusquely.</p>

<p>"I suppose you ain't heard&mdash;you wouldn't be
apt to!" she sobbed, and pushing back the locks
the wind drove into her reddened eyes, she broke
into incoherent sentences: he heard her as one in
a dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"And she would go&mdash;'twas the twenty-fifth&mdash;there
was dozens o' trees blown down&mdash;'twas just
before dark&mdash;her mother, she ran out after her
as soon's she knew&mdash;she called, but she didn't hear&mdash;she
saw her on the edge o' the rocks, an' she
almost got up to her an' screamed, an' it scared
her, we think&mdash;she turned 'round quick, an' she
went right off the cliff an' her mother saw her go&mdash;'twas
awful!"</p>

<p>Willard's eyes went beyond her to the woods;
the woman's voice, with its high, flat intonation,
brought the past so vividly before him that he
was unconscious of the actual scene&mdash;he lived
through the quick, terrible drama with the intensity
of a witness of it.</p>

<p>"No, they haven't found her yet&mdash;the surf's too
high. We always had a feeling she wouldn't live&mdash;she
wasn't like other girls&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Half unconsciously he unwrapped the photograph.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I brought this," he said dully. The woman
blanched and clutched the gate-post.</p>

<p>"Oh, take it away! Take it away!" she gasped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
a real terror in her eyes. "O Mr. Willard, how
could you&mdash;it's awful! I&mdash;I wouldn't have her
mother see it for all the world!" Her sobs grew
uncontrollable.</p>

<p>He bent it slowly across and thrust it in his
pocket.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said soothingly, "of course not,
of course not. I only wanted to tell&mdash;you all&mdash;that
it took the prize I told you about and&mdash;and
was a good thing for me. I hoped&mdash;I hoped&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He saw that she was trembling in the sudden
cold wind, and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"This has been a great shock to me," he said
quietly, his eyes still on the woods. "Please tell Mrs.
Storrs how I sympathise&mdash;how startled I was. I
am going abroad in a few days. I will send you my
address, and if there is ever anything I can do, you
will gratify me more than you can know by letting
me help you in any way. Give her these," and he
thrust out the great bunch of daffodils to her.
She took them, still crying softly, and turned
towards the house.</p>

<p>Later he found himself in the woods near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
great oak that lay just as it had fallen that night.
Beneath all the confused tumult of his thoughts
one clear truth rang like a bell, one bitter-sweet
certainty that caught him smiling strangely as he
realised it! "She's won! She's won!"</p>

<p>There, while the branches swayed above him,
and the surf, sinister and monotonous, pounded
below, the vision that had made them both famous
melted into the elusive reality, and he lived again
with absolute abandonment that sweet mad night,
he felt again her hair blown about his face as he
lay on the windy cliff with the lady of his dreams.</p>

<p>For him her fate was not dreadful&mdash;she could
not have died like other women. There was an intoxication
in her sudden taking away: she was
rapt out of life as she would have wished, he knew.</p>

<p>Slowly there grew upon him a frightened wonder
if she had lived for this. Her actual life had
been so empty, so unreal, so concentrated in those
piercing stolen moments; she had ended it, once
the heart of it had been caught and fixed to give
to others faint thrills of all she had felt so utterly.</p>

<p>"She died for it!" he felt, with a kind of awe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
that was far from all personal vanity&mdash;the blameless
egoism of the artist.</p>

<p>He left the little town hardly consciously. On
his outward voyage, when the gale beat the
vessel and the wind howled to the thundering
waves, he came to know that though a love more
real, a passion less elusive, might one day hold
him, there would rest always in his heart and brain
one ceaseless inspiration, one strange, sweet memory
that nothing could efface.</p>

<h2 id="WHEN_PIPPA_PASSED">WHEN PIPPA PASSED</h2></div>


<p>Mr. Delafield, stepping comfortably forth
from his club, had dined especially well, and was
in a correspondingly good humour. As the brisk
March wind swept across the corner just in front
of him, he meanwhile settling his glossy hat more
firmly on a fine, close-clipped grey head, a sudden
kindly impulse, not entirely usual with him,
sent him bending to his knee to pick up the fugitive
slip of white, scribbled foolscap that fluttered
by him, hotly pursued by a slender young man.</p>

<p>"Thanks. Oh, thanks!" murmured the pursuer,
as Delafield, with a courteous inclination of the
head, tendered the captured slip.</p>

<p>"Not at all." A consciousness of the boy's quick
panting, his anxious tug at the paper, actually
an almost audible beating of the heart, drew the
older man to look carefully at him. A white, oval
face, drooping mouth, black, deep-set eyes that
fairly burned into his, compelled attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Important paper, I suppose?" he inquired
lightly. "Wouldn't want to lose it."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;oh, no!"</p>

<p>"Get a wigging at the office?"</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it's not&mdash;they are my own&mdash;it is a poem!"
stammered the young man.</p>

<p>Delafield chuckled involuntarily, and then, as a
quick red poured over the other's cheeks, he made
a hasty gesture of apology.</p>

<p>"No offence&mdash;none at all, I assure you, Mr.&mdash;Mr.
Poet! I was only taken by surprise. One
doesn't often assist a poet in catching his works!"
He laughed again, a contented after-dinner
laugh.</p>

<p>Then, as the young man fell behind him quietly,
the incident being over, an idle desire for company
prompted him to delay his own pace.</p>

<p>"Do you write much? Get it printed? Good
publisher?" he inquired genially. Few persons
could resist Lester Delafield's smile: his very butler
warmed to it, and the woman who retained her
reserve under it he had never met.</p>

<p>Again the young man blushed. "Published? No,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
sir; I never dared to see&mdash;I don't know if it's
worth being printed," he said.</p>

<p>"But you think it's pretty good, eh? I'll bet
you do. I used to. Let me see it. I'll tell you if
it's worth anything."</p>

<p>They had turned into a quieter cross-street; the
wind had passed them by. Standing under a street-light,
benevolently amused at his impulse, Delafield
tucked his stick under his arm, uncreased the
paper, and noted the title of the poem aloud: <i>To
the Moon in a Stormy Night.</i> His eyebrows lifted;
he glanced quizzically at the young man, but met
such an earnest, searching look, so restrained, yet
so quivering, so terrified, yet so brave, that his
heart softened and he read on in silence.</p>

<p>A minute passed, two, three, and four. The man
read silently, the boy waited breathless in suspense.
The noisy, crowding city seemed to sweep by them,
leaving them stranded on this little point of time.</p>

<p>Mr. Delafield raised his eyes and regarded the
boy thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"You say you wrote this?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"When did you write it?"</p>

<p>"Last night."</p>

<p>"Have you any more like it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know if it's like it. I've got quite a
good deal more. What do you&mdash;&mdash;" He could get
no further. Drops of perspiration started from
his forehead. His mouth was drawn flat with
anxiety.</p>

<p>"This poetry," said Delafield, with a carefully
impersonal calm, "is very good. It is remarkably
good. It is stunning, in fact. '<i>And moored at last
in some pale bay of dawn</i>'&mdash;why did you stop
there? Isn't that rather abrupt?"</p>

<p>"That was when it ended. Do you really
think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think anything about it. I know. You
have a future before you, my young friend. I
should like to see&mdash;Good Lord, what is it?"</p>

<p>For the boy had twined his arms around the
lamp-post and was slowly sinking to the pavement.
His face was ghastly white. Delafield
grasped his arm, and as their eyes met, the older
man drew a quick breath and scowled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's not because&mdash;you're not&mdash;when did you
have your lunch?" he demanded shortly.</p>

<p>The boy smiled weakly.</p>

<p>"And your breakfast?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I had <i>that</i>&mdash;quite a little&mdash;really I did!"
he half whispered.</p>

<p>Delafield got him on his feet and around the
corner to a restaurant. As they entered, the smell
of the food weakened him again, and he staggered
against his friend, begging his pardon helplessly.</p>

<p>"Soup&mdash;and hurry it up, it's immaterial what
kind," the host commanded.</p>

<p>As the boy gulped it down he made out a further
order, and while the hot meat, vegetables, and
bread vanished and the strong, brown coffee lowered
in the cup, he lighted a long cigar and talked
with a quiet insistence. Later, when his guest
blinked drowsily behind a cloud of cigarette
smoke, he asked questions, marvelling at the simple
replies.</p>

<p>The boy's name was Henry West; it was twenty-two
years since he had made his appearance in a
family already large enough to regard his advent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
with a stoical endurance. His people all worked in
the mills in Lowell; he, too, till the noise and jar
gave him racking headaches. He made his first
verses in the mill. He had come to New York to
learn to be a clerk in a corner drug-store kept by
a distant cousin, but he couldn't seem to learn the
business. The names of the things were hard to
remember. His cousin said he was absent-minded.</p>

<p>And he had to read everything that was in sight:
if a thing was printed he seemed to have to read
it. He read books from the library and the night-school
when his cousin thought he was polishing
the soda-fountain. Of all the things he hated&mdash;and
they were many&mdash;the soda-fountain was the
worst. He wanted to study a great deal, but only
the studies he liked. Not algebra and geometry,
nor chemistry that made his head ache, but history
and poetry and French. He thought he
would like to know Italian, too. The family supposed
he was still in the drug-store, but he had
quarrelled with his cousin and left it a month ago.
He stayed mostly in the library and helped the
janitor with sweeping and airing the rooms. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
janitor paid him a little to ease his own hours of
night-watching, and often asked him to supper.
He read nearly all day and wrote at night. It was
better than the mills or the drug-store. He supposed
he was lazy&mdash;his family always said he
was.</p>

<p>"Come to this address to-morrow afternoon and
bring the rest of your poetry with you," said
Delafield, "I have an engagement at nine. May I
keep this one till you come?"&mdash;he shook the foolscap
significantly. The boy hesitated, almost imperceptibly,
then nodded. As Delafield left the
little table he did not rise with him, but sat with
his eyes fixed on the smoke-rings.</p>

<p>"They do not teach courtesy in the night-schools,
evidently," mused the older man, peering
for a cab; "but one can't have everything. My
manners have been on occasion commended&mdash;but I
can't write poetry like that."</p>

<p>He tasted in advance the pleasure of reading
the poem to Anne: how her brown eyes would
dilate and glow, how eagerly her long, slender fingers
would clasp and unclasp. People called her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
cold, they told him; for his part he never could
see why. True, she was not kittenish, like the other
nieces; she didn't try to flirt with her old uncle, as
Ellen's girls did; but what an enthusiasm for fine
things, what a quick, keen mind the child had!
Child&mdash;Anne was twenty-five by now. Was it true
that she might never marry? Ellen said&mdash;but then
Ellen was always a little jealous of poor Anne's
money. The girl couldn't help her legacies. Still,
at twenty-five&mdash;perhaps it was true that she expected
too much, thought too seriously, reasoned
morbidly that they were after her money.</p>

<p>Seated opposite her in his favourite oak chair,
looking with a sudden impersonal appraisal at the
slender figure in clinging black lace, the cool pallor
of the face under the smooth dark hair, the
rope of pearls that hung from her firm, girlish
shoulders, it dawned on him that there was something
wanting in this not quite sufficiently charming
piece of womanhood. She was too black-and-white,
too unswerving, too unflushed by life.
Humanity, with its countless moulding and colouring
touches, seemed to slip away from either side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of her, like the waves from some proud young
prow, and fall behind.</p>

<p>"Yet she's not unsympathetic&mdash;I swear she's
not!" he thought, as her eyes glowed to the poem
and her lips parted delightedly.</p>

<p>"'<i>And moored at last in some pale bay</i>'&mdash;Uncle
Les, isn't that beautiful! Not that it's really so
fine as the first part, but it's easier to remember.
And he was hungry? Oh, oh! And you discovered
him, didn't you?"</p>

<p>He nodded complacently.</p>

<p>"I'll bring you around the rest of the things
to-morrow. I knew you'd enjoy this, Anne. You
love&mdash;really love&mdash;this sort of thing, don't you?"</p>

<p>She nodded eagerly.</p>

<p>"But nothing else? Nobody&mdash;you don't think
that perhaps you're letting&mdash;after all, my dear,
life is something more than the beautiful things
you surround yourself with&mdash;pictures and music
and poetry, and all that. It really is. There is so
much&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is one's religion," she said quietly and
not uncordially. But she had retreated intangibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
from him. She sat there, remote as her cold pearls,
as far from the rough, sweet uses of the world as
the priceless china in her cabinets.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course, there is religion," he answered
listlessly.</p>

<p>Two days later they sat, all three, in her library,
while West read them his poems. The two looked
at each other in amazement. Where had this untrained
factory boy got it all? What wonderful
voices had sung to him above the whirring of the
wheels; what delicate visions had risen through
the smoky pall of his sordid days? He wrote only
of Nature: the brown brook water in spring;
the pale, hurrying leaves of November; a bird
glimpsed through pink apple-blossoms; the full
river encircling a bending elm. In the vivid swiftness
of effect, the simple subtlety of treatment,
there was a recalling of the Japanese witchery of
suggestion; the faint tinge of sadness in every
poem left in the mind precisely the sweet regret
that the beauty of the world must always leave.
At the "Clearing Shower," perhaps the most compelling
of all his work, quick drops started to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
girl's eyes, so intense was the vision of the moist,
green-breathing earth, the torn fleece of the
clouds, the broken chirping of frightened birds,
the softened, yellow light that reassures and saddens
at once. His art was not Wordsworth's nor
Shelley's; it was as if Keats had turned from human
passion and consecrated the beauty of his
verse to the beauty of Nature&mdash;but simply, sadly,
and through a veil of Heine's tears.</p>

<p>Delafield nodded mutely to his niece, then
walked over to the boy.</p>

<p>"There will be plenty of people to tell you
later," he said, holding out his hand, "but let me
be the first. You are a genius, Mr. West, and your
country will be proud of your work some day.
There is no American to-day writing such poetry."</p>

<p>West took his hand awkwardly, not rising from
his chair. He fingered his manuscript nervously.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wouldn't want to be laughed at," he demurred.
"Other folks mightn't be so kind as you.
If anybody laughed&mdash;I&mdash;it would just about kill
me!" he concluded, passionately. They smiled sympathetically
at each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"But no one would laugh, I assure you, Mr.
West," Anne murmured, stooping to pick up a
scattered sheet.</p>

<p>He hardly noticed her. His eyes were fixed constantly
on Delafield: the girl had made no impression
upon him whatever. Nor did the elegance of
the furnishings, the evidences of great wealth
everywhere arouse in him the least apparent curiosity.
Having no knowledge of the many grades
of material prosperity between his own meagre
surroundings and Anne Delafield's luxury, he accepted
the one as he had endured the other, his
mind quite removed from either, his eyes looking
beyond.</p>

<p>Anne had supposed that her uncle would carry
the poems to one of the leading magazines, but he
pooh-poohed the idea.</p>

<p>"I think not. We're not going to have the boy
mixed up with the hacks that turn out two or
three inches of rhymes to fill up a page in a magazine,"
he declared. "We'll have D&mdash;&mdash; drop in
some night and West shall read 'em to him. Then
we'll bring out a book. Here and in England&mdash;they'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
like him there, or I'm much mistaken."</p>

<p>In a month it seemed that they had always
known him. Intimacy was so impossible with his inturned,
elusive nature, that to have him sitting
through hours of silence by the birch fire, abstracted,
dreamy, inattentive, except to some
chance word that stirred his fancy, was to know
him well, to all intents. His nerves, dulled to all
great torments like poverty, hunger, obscurity,
quivered like violin strings under little unaccustomed
jarrings. If interrupted in the reading of
his verses he would lose his control beyond belief;
a chance cough, the falling of an ember, put him
out of tune for hours. He possessed little sense of
humour, and the lightest satire turned him sulky.
A child might have teased him to madness; it was
evident to them that his utterly lonely life had
preserved him from constant torture at the hands
of associates.</p>

<p>Until the book was complete he refused to have
the great publisher brought to hear it read. Sometimes
for days they would not see him, then on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
some rainy evening he would appear, lonely and
hungry, eager for the praise and warmth of
Anne's library, an exquisite poem in his pocket.
Served to repletion by the secretly scornful butler,
he would smoke a while, then draw out the sheet
of foolscap, and read in his nervous yet musical
voice the latest page of the book that was to bring
him fame.</p>

<p>On one such night&mdash;it was when he brought
them "Dawn on the River," the only poem of
which Anne had a copy, and the one which a well-known
firm afterward printed under his photograph
and sold by thousands at Easter-tide&mdash;he
broke through the mist&mdash;it was too impalpable to
be called a wall of reserve&mdash;that held his personality
apart from them, and talked wonderfully for
an hour. They seemed to see the clear soul of some
gentle, strayed fawn; his thoughts were like summer
clouds mirrored in a placid brook. All the
crowding, sweating humanity of his stunted boyhood
had flowed through his youth like an ugly
drain laid through a fresh mountain stream. He
seemed to have lived all his years with young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
David on the hillside, and wealth and poverty,
crowds and loneliness, love and death were as far
from his life as if the vast procession of them all
that swept by him daily through the great city
had never been.</p>

<p>As he talked, Delafield found his eyes drawn
from the boy's face to Anne's. Never before had
he seen just that faint, steady rose in her cheeks,
that sweet glow in her eyes. As she leaned forward,
her very pearls seemed to catch a red tinge from
the fire: it occurred to him for the first time that
she looked like Ellen's girls&mdash;there was a suggestion
of Kitty in the curve of her cheek.</p>

<p>Was it possible that Anne&mdash;no, it could not be.
To think of the men that had tried to come into
her life and failed&mdash;such men! And this boy, this
elf, to whom no woman was so real or so dear as
a tree in the glen!</p>

<p>For two weeks after that night he did not come.
Anne never mentioned his name, and Delafield,
doubtful of what that might portend, tried to believe
that she had forgotten him. Toward the end
of the second week she spoke of the completion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
his book, and suggested that her uncle should invite
Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;: "Urge Henry to consent to it,"
she added, "he will do anything for you, Uncle
Les."</p>

<p>"More than for you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"For me?" She flushed a little. "I doubt if he
distinguishes me from my portrait over the mantel!"</p>

<p>"And you wish that he would," Delafield wanted
to reply, trying to remember if she had ever called
him "Henry" before.</p>

<p>On a warm April evening, when the windows
were open to catch the setting sun and the odour
of the blossoming window-boxes, he came at last.
As he stepped into the room, head erect, eyes wide
and bright, they became aware immediately of a
change in him. His glance was more conscious,
more alert, his hand-grasp more assured.</p>

<p>"You are in time to dine with us," Anne said,
with her grave smile, "we are all alone. Will you
stay?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, I can't stay, I'm going somewhere
else," he answered quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the new poem?" Delafield inquired, "did
you get it done? That was to be the last, wasn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I haven't been writing lately," he explained,
blushing a little. "I've been too busy&mdash;that
is, I've been too&mdash;I've been thinking of something
else." He stood before them in the full light
of the late day; every expression in his sensitive,
mobile face showed clear.</p>

<p>"A perfectly wonderful thing has happened,"
he burst out, "you couldn't understand. Nobody
can understand but me, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who is she?" said Delafield bluntly.</p>

<p>"How did you know?" cried the boy, "have you
seen&mdash;did she tell&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course not. When did it happen?"</p>

<p>Delafield kept his face persistently from Anne's.
For the world he could not have looked at her.</p>

<p>"It was last week." West was smiling eagerly
at him, ignoring the woman's presence.</p>

<p>"I went into the grocer's to do an errand for
Mr. Swazey, and she was behind the little grating&mdash;you
pay her. She is the cashier. I didn't take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
my change, and she had to call me back, and we
dropped it all over the floor. She helped me pick
it up. Oh, if you could see her, Mr. Delafield!"</p>

<p>"Is she handsome?"</p>

<p>"She is a perfectly beautiful woman," said the
boy.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear!" murmured the older man.</p>

<p>"We are engaged, but her mother objects to
me. In fact&mdash;in fact, her mother doesn't know that
she is engaged. She has been engaged before. But
she never really loved the man. Her mother doesn't
care for poetry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that word, Delafield, with a distinct effort,
connected this babbling druggist's clerk with his
poet of "The Clearing Shower." There could be
no doubt that they were the same person. As in
a dream he listened to the boy.</p>

<p>"And that's what I dropped in to see about. I
told her mother all you said about me being sure
to be well-off some day, and about the book being
published soon, and her brother, that's Pippa's
uncle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What name did you say?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pippa. That's her name. Philippa it is really;
she was named after the daughter of a lady her
mother nursed when she was sick, and so she named
her after this lady's daughter. But she couldn't
say it plain, you see, so she always called herself
Pippa for short, and so they all call her that still.
I suppose you never heard it before&mdash;I never did."</p>

<p>"It is a strange name&mdash;for a cashier," said Mr.
Delafield.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. Well, her Uncle Joseph is a stenographer
in a newspaper office, and he knows a
good deal about this sort of thing, and he says
not to publish with the D&mdash;&mdash;s. He says they're
a poky firm and don't advertise enough. If I gave
the book to the L&mdash;&mdash;s they'd push it along, he
says. He says they'd make anything sell. The
D&mdash;&mdash;s wouldn't put up posters on bill-boards,
now, would they?"</p>

<p>"I suppose not," said Delafield. He felt unaccountably
tired. He had not realised till now how
much his mind had been filled with Henry West
and his poetry, how much he had anticipated introducing
his rare young proteg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"And of course I want to do the best for myself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course, beyond a doubt."</p>

<p>How could a person change so in two weeks?
What had turned that sensitive dreamer into this
bustling young lover?</p>

<p>"You see, sir, I've got a good many things to
consider," he smiled happily.</p>

<p>"Certainly, West, I appreciate that. At the
same time I doubt if you will do better with anybody
than you can with Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;. It may be the
L&mdash;&mdash;s wouldn't want your book. It is not what
is known as a popular book, you know. Poetry
appeals to a limited public, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, it's all right. Only I thought you
might want to know what Uncle Joseph said,
that's all. I must go now," and he turned.</p>

<p>"Miss Delafield is still here," said her uncle,
coldly.</p>

<p>"Oh, good-night," West murmured, and left the
room.</p>

<p>"Is it really he?" Delafield hazarded, hardly
glancing at her. She met his look calmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"At any rate the book is ready, which is the
principal thing, I suppose," she said.</p>

<p>He found himself illogically wishing she had
resented it more. "It was a mistake," he thought,
"she has no feeling for him."</p>

<p>Through the weeks that followed they avoided
mentioning his name, and each, trusting that the
other would forget, thought of him in puzzled
silence.</p>

<p>When he came to them next, toward the end of
May, it seemed for a moment, as he flung himself
into a chair and stared moodily at the empty fireplace,
that his old self had returned. Thin and
shabby, with dark rings under his eyes, he looked
like the boy Delafield had warmed and fed that
cold March night. But his words undeceived them.</p>

<p>"I shall shoot myself if this doesn't stop," he
said bitterly. Anne started.</p>

<p>"Here, here, West, none of that," the older man
corrected, sharply. "That's no thing to say&mdash;what
is the matter?"</p>

<p>"It's Pippa," he returned, simply. "She won't
marry me. I'll kill myself if she don't. I can't eat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
I can't sleep, I can't think. It cuts into me night
and day. You don't know how it kills me&mdash;you
don't know!"</p>

<p>He writhed like a child in physical pain. His
face was distorted: he made no more effort to conceal
his misery than his delight of weeks ago.
Delafield showed a little of his disgust.</p>

<p>"Come, come, West," he said, "control yourself.
This is no killing matter. Better men than you
have been thrown over before this. If she won't
have you, take it like a man, and get to work.
It's time your book was under way."</p>

<p>West stared dully at him.</p>

<p>"Book? book?" he repeated. "Oh, damn the
book! I'd throw it away this minute to feel her
arms around me! When I think of how we used
to sit in Uncle Joseph's hammock&mdash;Oh, I can't
endure it, I can't!"</p>

<p>He leaned his head on his arms and rocked to
and fro in abject misery.</p>

<p>"She laughs at me&mdash;just laughs at me!" he
moaned. "I'm ashamed to go near them."</p>

<p>"Keep away, then," said Delafield shortly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't!" he fairly sobbed.</p>

<p>Anne spoke softly from a dim corner:</p>

<p>"Does she know about the book?"</p>

<p>"She doesn't care anything about it. She says
I better be getting a job somewhere. I&mdash;I would,
if she'd marry me. I'd go to the drug-store!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" she breathed.</p>

<p>"If only she'd be engaged again," he muttered,
half to himself, "I'd finish the book, and then,
perhaps&mdash;&mdash;" He began to rock again. "But she
won't, she won't!" he wailed.</p>

<p>"If you will tell me where she lives," said Anne
quietly, and as if the conversation were to the last
degree conventional, "I will go to see her and
talk the matter over. Perhaps she doesn't understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear Anne! Are you mad?"</p>

<p>As Delafield spoke, West interrupted:</p>

<p>"I'd rather Mr. Delafield would go," he said
quickly, "if&mdash;if he would. Maybe she'd listen to
you."</p>

<p>"I will do nothing of the sort," Delafield returned
angrily. "As if anything I could say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
could compare with Miss Delafield's words! You
are an ungrateful little beast, West. A woman,
like Pippa herself, is the best person to understand
the matter."</p>

<p>"All right," the boy assented wearily, "only
she isn't like Pippa, not a bit. Pippa's different."</p>

<p>Anne coloured deeply, and Delafield cursed the
day he met the boy. His niece he did not pretend to
understand.</p>

<p>The next afternoon, as he chafed in the stuffy
dining-room-parlour of the flat that was Pippa's
home, listening to the quarrelling of a half dozen
children on the dreary little roof-garden below
him as to who should swing in Uncle Joseph's hammock,
he understood her less and less. What did
she expect to gain from this visit? Was she satisfying
her idea of duty or her curiosity? How much
did she care, anyhow?</p>

<p>A steady murmur of voices came from a room
behind the one he occupied. The afternoon wore
on. He began to grow sleepy.</p>

<p>At last the door was flung open. Anne, looking
pale and tired, entered the room, followed by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
large, handsome girl with a heavy rope of auburn
hair twisted low over her forehead. She had a
frank, vulgar smile, and shallow, red-brown eyes.
In her plump, large-limbed beauty she was like a
well-kept cat. The day was damp and hot, and
her mussed white shirt-waist clung to her broad
curve of shoulder and breast. In her eyes, as she
smiled at him, was the quiet ease of a conscious
beauty. Beside her Anne seemed unimportant.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry about the book, Mr. Delafield," she
said, with a slow smile. "But I guess you don't
know Henry very well if you think any reasonable
girl would think of marrying him for a minute.
The gentleman I've been keeping company with
some time had a little misunderstanding with me,
and 'twas more or less to spite him, I guess, that
I got engaged to Henry. It never seemed to me
it mattered much either way."</p>

<p>"You have broken his heart," said Delafield
stiffly.</p>

<p>She looked vaguely at her short, fat fingers:
her hands were like a baby's in shape.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," she said. "He's an awful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
unreasonable fellow, Henry is. He gets into such
tantrums&mdash;I don't dare tell him about Mr. Winch&mdash;that's
the gentleman I was speaking of. We're
going to be married in the fall. He's in a livery-stable:
I guess you probably noticed it as you came
along Sixth Avenue&mdash;Judd and Winch. He's only
junior partner, but he knows as much about running
a real swell funeral as any of the uptown
men&mdash;Mr. Judd says so. Henry's afraid of a horse,
you know. It don't seem quite natural for a man
not to know about horses, does it, now?"</p>

<p>"If you had only waited till his book came out,"
said Delafield tentatively. As he looked at her he
was conscious of a ridiculous satisfaction that such
a fine woman should know her own mind so perfectly.
She was a very complete creature, in her
way. He realised that in this strangely assorted
quartette he and she were involuntarily on one
side of an intangible line, his niece and their unintelligible
proteg on the other.</p>

<p>"Wait? But I did wait. I waited over a week,"
she explained, "and then I couldn't stand it any
longer. He'd drive me to drink. For one thing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Henry's changed so. When we first knew him he
was really as entertaining a gentleman as I ever
saw&mdash;and I've had a great deal of attention. Why,
we'd sit around and laugh till we nearly died, he'd
say such ridiculous things. He was so different.
Ma used to say if he was much funnier she'd think
he'd ought to have a keeper! The way he'd go
on&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Anne had turned her back and was looking
steadily at the room they had left. Pippa and
Delafield might have been alone.</p>

<p>"But when we got engaged, he seemed to
change, somehow. I don't know if you've noticed
it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Delafield nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, that's what I mean. I didn't care any
more about him, then. I guess I sort of woke up,"
she laughed into his eyes. "He tires me to death
with how he'll shoot himself," she added; "they
always say that, you know, but they never
do."</p>

<p>Anne moved toward the door and Delafield followed
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"I must say that I appreciate your position,
Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;" he stopped, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Cooley&mdash;Miss Philippa Cooley," she supplied.
"Of course you do. Ma said she hoped I'd have
too much sense to stand up with a little radish
of a man like that, even if he could support
me!"</p>

<p>"But I think it was rather hard on all of us
that you should have engaged yourself to him at
all. You must have known how it would end." He
tried to speak reprovingly.</p>

<p>She threw him a rich glance.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can't help it sometimes," she murmured.
"He teased so hard&mdash;you don't want to
be disagreeable. As I was telling Miss Delafield&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We must go," said Anne, briefly.</p>

<p>As they drove home, an inexplicable desire to
provoke her, to rouse some warm feeling in her,
mastered him.</p>

<p>"Your Aunt Ellen would enjoy this deep interest
in the love affairs of an ex-druggist's clerk and a
grocer's cashier," he said lightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Would she?" Anne returned quietly, and was
ashamed of his freakish impulse.</p>

<p>When they told him that evening that they had
been able to accomplish nothing he only stared at
them gloomily.</p>

<p>"I knew it&mdash;I knew it," he muttered. "I did a
poem last night&mdash;it's the last I shall ever do. You
can put it in the book. It's the best I've done yet."</p>

<p>Delafield hardly noticed his words as he seized
the poem. What if from this sordid little tragedy
had sprung the very flower of the poet's genius?
He read eagerly. In a moment his face fell. He
stared doubtfully at the boy.</p>

<p>"Well," said West irritably, "can't you read
it? Give it here&mdash;I'll read it to you."</p>

<p>"You needn't, I can read it well enough."</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"I think it's rot," Delafield returned curtly. He
was bitterly disappointed.</p>

<p>"Rot?" the boy's eyes narrowed. "What d'you
mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that this doggerel is utterly unworthy
of you, West, and that you certainly cannot in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>clude
it in your book. It is the cheapest sentimentalism&mdash;good
heavens, can't you see it? Have you
no critical faculty whatever?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Lester, <i>don't</i>!" Anne implored.
"Let me see it," and she put out her hand. The
young man struck it away and seized the paper.</p>

<p>"I won't trouble you with my 'rot' any more,
Mr. Delafield," he said, with a boyish grandiloquence,
"we'll see what other people have to say
about it."</p>

<p>"Here, West, don't go away angry!" the
older man urged, "I shouldn't have been so
harsh. You've done such fine work that I couldn't
bear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hush your noise!" West interrupted, brutally,
"neither can I bear! You've driven me to
death between you all&mdash;you'll never see me
again!" and he flung out of the room.</p>

<p>Delafield set his teeth. "This is too much," he
said slowly. "The vulgar little cad! No, I won't
go after him, Anne; let him fume it out himself.
I'll try to ask D&mdash;&mdash; over next week, just the
same."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>But when Mr. D&mdash;&mdash; came over, full of pleasant
anticipation, it was only to hear of the shocking
death of the boy, whose photograph, taken
from a cheap gilt locket of Pippa's, he afterward
used over the popular gift-card, "Dawn on the
River."</p>

<p>"Couldn't even shoot himself like a gentleman,"
said Delafield roughly. "Jumping seven stories&mdash;pah!"</p>

<p>"But the poems&mdash;the poems?" urged the publisher,
"surely they&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Anne took from the table an oblong tin biscuit-box
and softly lifted the cover.</p>

<p>"Here are the poems," she said, pointing to a
mass of fine, grey paper-ashes.</p>

<p>"He sent them to you?"</p>

<p>Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;'s eyes lighted comprehensively; he
glanced at the girl's white face and inscrutable
dark-ringed eyes with a restrained sympathy.</p>

<p>"He sent them to my uncle," she replied quietly.</p>

<h2 id="THE_BACKSLIDING_OF">THE BACKSLIDING OF HARRIET BLAKE</h2></div>


<p>The Rev. Mr. Freeland looked down the long,
narrow poorhouse table, and then glanced inquiringly
at the matron.</p>

<p>"What has become of Harriet Blake, Mrs.
Markham?" he asked. "I thought she sat at this
table&mdash;I hope she's not ill?"</p>

<p>"Harriet's backslid," announced the Widow
Sheldon laconically. She was a Baptist, of the
variety sometimes known as hard-shelled, and made
nothing of interrupting the discourse of any representative
of a denomination unpleasing to her.</p>

<p>"Backslid?" repeated the reverend guest, dropping
his napkin.</p>

<p>"She don't believe in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Harriet," interrupted the matron, somewhat
crossly, and with an unconcealed frown for the
Widow Sheldon, "Harriet is taking her dinner
alone. She&mdash;she is not quite well, I think. I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
speak to you about her later," she added as the
pastor's eyes grew round at her. The widow
Sheldon sniffed loudly.</p>

<p>"A person who has ter have her vittles carried
up ter the bed-chamber on account o' losing any
little faith she might 'a had," she began, but old
Uncle Peterson broke in with his gentle drawl:</p>

<p>"Oh, come on, Mis' Sheldon, don't go and spile
a good biled dinner with words o' bitterness," he
urged. "Harriet's a good woman, as is known to
all, and if she's travellin' through dark ways just
now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The pastor looked puzzled, but he saw that the
subject was better left alone: previous visits to
the poorhouse had led him to dread the Widow
Sheldon's tongue. He nodded approvingly at
Uncle Peterson.</p>

<p>"Quite right, quite right," he said quickly.
"That's the spirit for us all to have. Shall I ask
the blessing, Mrs. Markham?" And the meal
went on.</p>

<p>But there was something in the air that hot
Sunday noon; something that lent variety to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
usual monotony of the querulous meal-times. There
was less comment on the food than was usual, and
the Widow Sheldon's resentful silence was more
impressive than her ordinary vindictive volubility.
It appeared that something had actually happened.</p>

<p>Once in her private sitting-room the matron
began, low-voiced, with an occasional glance at the
closed door, as if to make certain that no curious
inmate lurked behind it:</p>

<p>"If Harriet Blake doesn't grow more sensible
very soon I shall certainly go crazy; I invited you,
Mr. Freeland, to dinner to-day because Harriet
used to like your prayers in the afternoon, and
it may help her to talk to you&mdash;but I don't know.
She's a very obstinate old lady. The whole house
talks about nothing else, and she's just morbid
enough to like it. They gossip about her and fight
about her till the air is blue with it. It was bad
enough at election time, but religion is worse than
politics."</p>

<p>The pastor made as if he would interrupt, but
she overbore him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
"If you can't stop her she must go home to
her niece, though she can't really afford to keep
her and oughtn't to be asked&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do I understand that Harriet is in doubt&mdash;has
lost her Christian faith?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well&mdash;no; but in a way I suppose she
has. She says that she&mdash;she can't see&mdash;in fact,
she doesn't believe any more in the Holy
Ghost!"</p>

<p>"Doesn't <i>believe</i> in h&mdash;in it?" Mr. Freeland
was absolutely unprepared for precisely this form
of agnosticism, and showed it.</p>

<p>"She says she doesn't see any sense in it," responded
Mrs. Markham, briefly.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;ah, yes!" The pastor looked vaguely over
her head. There was a pause, and then he gathered
himself together.</p>

<p>"But this&mdash;this is all wrong!" he said forcibly.</p>

<p>"So we tell her," replied the matron.</p>

<p>"It is sinful&mdash;it is extremely dangerous!" he
repeated, still more forcibly.</p>

<p>"That's what the Widow Sheldon says," replied
the matron. "She lectures her about it every meal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and Harriet can't stand it. She says she can't help
what she believes, and I can't blame her for
that."</p>

<p>"How long&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She's been so for two weeks now, and she gets
worse and worse. I had the Methodist minister&mdash;Harriet
used to attend that church&mdash;up to talk
to her about it, to see if she'd feel better, and he
talked for four hours. Harriet sat as still as a
stone, he said, and never moved or paid the least
attention to him. Finally he asked her why she
didn't answer, and she said he hadn't asked her
opinion that she could see. So he asked her what it
was, and she said that the Lord Almighty created
the earth and that his Son, the Redeemer, saved
it, and she didn't see anything more for the Holy
Ghost to do. And everything that he told her she
said one or the other could do perfectly well alone!
And the angrier Mr. Dent got, the calmer Harriet
was, I suppose, for he left in a rage, almost&mdash;I
suppose it was trying, even for a minister&mdash;and
when I went up to Harriet she seemed very calm.
She told me triumphantly that the last thing she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
did was to show him that big Bible of hers with
the picture in the front, where she's crossed out
the figure of the dove with ink, and to tell him
that she was no Papist, to worship graven images
of birds!"</p>

<p>Mr. Freeland shook his head gravely. "Dear,
dear, dear!" he said.</p>

<p>"And then I got Dr. Henshawe from St. Mary's,
in the city, you know, who's out here this summer,
to come in. He's a very fine man, and very interesting.
He stayed a while with Harriet, and told
her not to mind, but to go on, and pray, and do
the best she could, and she couldn't be blamed.
He told me afterwards that he was far from considering
her religious condition a safe one, but
that she would soon be ill, and was growing morbid,
and he tried to soothe her. She fell into a
dreadful passion, and called him a lukewarm
Jesuit, and told him that she was going to hell
just because she couldn't believe in the Holy
Ghost! He was very polite and quiet, and picked
a rose when he went&mdash;he complimented the house&mdash;but
Harriet wouldn't eat any dinner nor tea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
she was so angry. Of course it excites the others&mdash;they
haven't much to think about, you know&mdash;and
I'm really growing nervous. Old William
Peterson, that gentle old man, preached a revivalist
sermon day before yesterday, and got
them all stirred up, so that Mrs. Sheldon groaned
and cried all night, and kept Sarah Waters awake.
And when Sarah stays awake all night, there's
no living with her&mdash;none!"</p>

<p>Mr. Freeland looked frankly puzzled. He was
not a particularly able man, and very far from
originality of any sort. His doctrinal position,
though always considered very solid, was somewhat
stereotyped, and he had never happened to
run against this peculiar form of apostasy. But he
was a kindly man, and very honestly convinced of
the responsibility of his position; moreover, he remembered
Harriet pleasantly; he had thought her
a very nice old lady. So he took his little Bible out
of his pocket, and hoped that a desire to succeed
where Mr. Dent and Dr. Henshawe had failed
would not be accounted to him for unrighteousness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Mrs. Markham led the way across the hall and
up the stairs. Before a door she paused to say,
"As long as Harriet is upset in this way she has
the room alone, because Mary Smith scolds her all
night for being so sinful, and it makes them both
cross. Mary is in the hall-room, and talks in her
sleep so that nobody can rest very well. It doesn't
disturb Harriet at all, she's such a sound sleeper,
and I wish she could go back! You don't know
how this disturbs us! Remember that we have
prayer-meeting at half-past four," and she left
him alone before the door.</p>

<p>Mr. Freeland knocked loudly and entered. Before
him in the clean, bare room, with its rag-carpets,
mats, and pine furnishings, sat a little
old woman, her hands folded in her lap, her head
erect, her eyes fixed uncompromisingly on the
door. He started as he saw her face; it was so
changed from the time, two weeks or more ago,
when he had delivered that admirable prayer for
charity and loving kindness on the occasion when
the Widow Sheldon had thrown the butter-plate
at old Mis' Landers. Thin and sunken, with dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
serried hollows under her still bright eyes&mdash;she
had aged ten years in those weeks.</p>

<p>"My sister, my poor, suffering, misled sister,"
began the pastor; but Harriet's eyes flashed
ominously.</p>

<p>"If you come to talk to me about that Holy
Ghost, I ain't got nothin' to say," she declared,
"an' if you think I'm goin' to say another word
myself, you're mistaken. I'm a pore sinful woman,
but I ain't goin' to be pestered t' death! I'm doin'
the best I can 'bout it, an' I've prayed 'bout it,
an' Mr. Dent an' a Papist, they both talked 'bout
it till I nearly died. I don't see any more sense
in it than I did before&mdash;not a morsel. So if that's
what brought you, you might just as well start
back this minute!"</p>

<p>Her reverend guest stared at her dumfounded.
Was this the little woman who had pressed his
hand at the prayer-meeting and thanked him so
piously, so meekly, for such "beautiful prayin'?"</p>

<p>"You are greatly changed since I saw you last,
Miss Blake," he said gravely. "Your spirit was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
gentler, your mind was more religiously inclined.
I found you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You didn't find me pestered t' death," said
Harriet briefly, somewhat mollified by his "Miss
Blake."</p>

<p>"I was led to believe that you were suffering,
that you were in trouble," hazarded the
pastor.</p>

<p>Never in his somewhat self-sufficient life had he
felt such difficulty in giving spiritual advice. Even
to his thick-skinned personality it was deeply evident
that this sharp-tongued little woman was in
great trouble. Ordinarily, a certain facility for
quotation and application made him a confident
speaker, but to-day he felt impeded, held back
by the self-control and patience of his listener.
For he saw that she was patient; that she
could say much more if she chose; that she
was, beneath all her sharpness, alarmed and worried.</p>

<p>His somewhat perplexed air, his evident memory
of her earlier estate, his startled recognition
of her changed appearance had the effect that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
nothing else could have had. Her hands twisted
nervously in her lap, her mouth twitched, she
dropped her eyes, and opened her lips once or
twice without speaking. Suddenly, with a little
gasp, she began:</p>

<p>"If you think I don't care, you're mistaken.
I'm just about sick. I been a Christian and a
good believer all my life, and now I ain't. Maybe
I don't care about that? They just pester me
t' death, and Mis' Markham, she can't stop 'em.
They'll send me back to Sarah's, that's my niece,
and they can't keep me there. They ain't good to
me there, and I get fever 'n ague every day o'
my life there. But I can't help it&mdash;I can't help
it! I got ter go!"</p>

<p>Some good angel held Mr. Freeland silent, and
after a moment she went on.</p>

<p>"I'm sixty-two years old, and I never was anything
but a churchgoer an' a believer. Two weeks
ago to-day I set in this chair an' looked out the
winder, an' I see the birds pickin' in the front
yard."</p>

<p>He followed her eyes and watched for a mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>ment
the poor house pigeons preening and posing
in the noon sun. They whitened the summer grass,
and their clucking and cooing formed the undertone
of the old woman's confession.</p>

<p>"I see 'em there, and I got thinkin' about the
dove in my Bible an' the Holy Ghost. And it just
come into my mind like a shot&mdash;what's the good
of it? What'd it ever done for me? What's the
sense of a bird, anyhow? An' I worked over it,
and I worried over it, an' I got to talkin' with Mis'
Sheldon about it while we was workin' together, and
she just made me hate it more. She said I'd go to
hell&mdash;me, a believer for sixty-two years! An' I've
cried till I can't cry any more, an' I've prayed
till I'm tired of prayin', and nothin' happens to
me exceptin' I hate it more. An' if they send me
back to Sarah's I'll die, that's the truth. But I'll
have t' go&mdash;I'll have t' go!"</p>

<p>She rocked back and forth, dry-eyed, but in an
agony of grief. The pastor remembered the time
when he had wrestled with certain damnation in
the form of terrible religious doubt, and experienced
again that peculiar helplessness, that isola<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>tion,
that terror of hope gone from him that had
dignified even his commonplace life. His vocabulary
forsook him, his periods and phrases receded
from his mind like the tide from the beach, and
left it bare of suggestion. He looked at her for a
moment, and as she bent her tired old head over
her arm and sobbed the dry, creaking sob of
the ageing spirit that looks forward to no long
and gayer future, he felt that the time was short
and kindness not too lenient for the sinner.</p>

<p>"I will send my wife over," he said, suddenly.
"Would&mdash;would you want to see her?"</p>

<p>Harriet had stiffened again and got herself in
hand. "I don't want that any one should put 'emselves
out for me," she said dryly. "I guess I'll
get along. I'd just as lief see Mis' Freeland if it
ain't any trouble to any one. But I don't know
as anybody c'n do anything. I ain't very pleasant
comp'ny. An' I dunno as the room's cleared up
enough. I ain't swept it sence day before yesterday."</p>

<p>Her guest had risen and moved toward the door.
He felt curiously cold and dull. Was this the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
help he had come to give? His tongue was
tied; his lips refused to utter even one text.</p>

<p>"Good-afternoon, Miss Blake," he said.</p>

<p>"Good-afternoon," said Harriet, and he went
out.</p>

<p>She shut the door behind him, and stood for a
moment looking at the pigeons. Emotion had
shaken her too often of late, and she was too tired
to bear more confusion of feeling. She only knew
that she was very tired, and that she should like
to get away from the scene of so many struggles.
Suddenly she took her gingham sunbonnet from
the wall, and left the room. She went softly down
the hall, and slipping through the screen door near
the lower end crept down the back stairs and
through the deserted kitchen.</p>

<p>A Sunday stillness reigned there, and no one
was near to see her. She got a piece of bread from
the large pantry, and noticed with disgust that
the shelves were dusty and the bread-tin full of
pieces and crusts. To keep this neat was her work,
but she had been excused for the last three days,
since she was far too weak to manage it. Out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
through the last blind-door, and she was in the field
behind the barn. She walked feverishly to the little
wood close by and sank down exhausted under a
large chestnut-tree.</p>

<p>"I'm tired&mdash;I'm dead tired out!" she whispered
to herself. "I'll just stay here a minute 'fore I
go on."</p>

<p>Had Mr. Freeland seen her then he would have
been more startled than before, for two red
spots burned in her sunken cheeks and her eyes
glittered unnaturally. She had not eaten since
breakfast, for the boiled dinner had sickened her,
and though she was weak for want of food she
had not strength to munch the great piece of rye
bread. Her head swam a little and strange tunes
seemed to sound all about her. Her mother's voice,
almost in her ear, sang her to sleep with the Old
Hundred Doxology, and for a moment she listened
entranced, but as the phantom voice reached the
last line she opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"No, no!" she screamed. "No, no! I won't sing
to a bird! I won't! I'll go to Sarah's first!"</p>

<p>A stillness that frightened her followed. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>thing
pattered beside her, and she looked apprehensively
at the sky through a rift in the branches.</p>

<p>"Don't say it's rain!" she whispered, nervously.
"I'm fearful scairt o' thunder-storms!"</p>

<p>The sky was rapidly clouding over, and a growl
of thunder answered her. She started up, but fell
helplessly back.</p>

<p>"O Lord, I can't move! I can't move a step!
I'm too heavy!" she cried in terror. The storm
came on fast; the branches shook under a sudden
wind, and the birds grew still. She was too
weak to realise fully her situation, but what consciousness
she owned was swallowed up in terror. A
sudden flash, and she shrank together with a moan.</p>

<p>"I'm out o' my head&mdash;I'm not really here&mdash;I'm
in the house&mdash;I wouldn't be here f'r anything!"
she whispered. A heavy clap, and she screamed
with fear. The time when she left the house was
far away and misty in her mind. She could not
remember coming. The drops struck her in quick
succession and the muttering grew more frequent,
the flashes brighter. Sick with fright, she cowered
under the tree. Her childhood unfolded before her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
her girlhood; her poor pinched life assumed a
glory and fulness it had never had. So warm, so
sheltered, so contented it seemed to her.</p>

<p>A great harsh clap shook the little wood and a
vivid glare wrapped her about. With a wail she
fell back against the tree-trunk. Her mind was
clear again, she recalled everything. She had been
led out here to die. She was summoned forth to
meet the judgment of God. Heretic, infidel, blasphemer
that she was, she was to go before Him
that day!</p>

<p>Her clothes were soaked with rain, she shivered
with cold, she was too weak to take a step, but
she staggered to her knees and folded her hands.
The tree swayed above her, the wood was dark
as night, the rain to her weak nerves was deafening;
the powers of darkness raged about her. She
tried to pray for forgiveness, for peace at the last,
but in her mind, all too clear, was the remembrance
of her life for two weeks past. She set her teeth to
keep them from chattering so, and shivering at
each clap and gasping at each flash, she prayed:</p>

<p>"O Lord, if you are sendin' this storm to pun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>ish
me, I can't help it. I've believed in you all my
life, and I'm sixty-two and I'm going to die in
a thunder-storm. If it'll save me to believe in the
Holy Ghost, then I'll have to be damned eternally
as the Widder Sheldon says you'll do, for I can't,
I can't, I can't! I' been a believer all my life, and
I' only been this way two weeks, and if that counts
against all the rest, I'll just haf' to go to hell,
that's all. Feelin' as I do, you can't expect me to
change for a thunder-storm, Lord, scairt as I be.
It don't make no difference that I'm scairt, I feel
just the same. I' been a sinful woman, an' I pray
to be forgiven, but I can't change, Lord, I can't,
an' you wouldn't respect me if I was ter. Amen."</p>

<p>A glare that seemed to brighten the wood for
minutes and a terrific burst of thunder answered
her. With a little gasp she fell backward and lay
unconscious. The storm raged about her, but she
knew nothing of it. A little withered old woman,
she lay in a heap in the lap of all the elements,
and they beat upon her like a leaf.</p>

<p>If it were hours or minutes she did not know,
but she opened her eyes with pain upon a quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
world. The storm had passed, the leaves were
dripping, the sun was just beginning to brighten
the blue, the birds were twittering again. She got
up heavily, but with a certain fitful strength. She
turned around and dragged herself further into
the wood. Then, in dread of the thicker foliage,
she struck off uncertainly to the right. To her
the vengeance of God was only delayed; there was
only a momentary escape, but it was precious.
She was confused, terrified, beaten. She had no
notion in what direction the house lay. She felt
her legs tottering and reached painfully down to
pick up a large, gnarled, broken bough. The
effort all but stretched her beside it. But she leaned
on it, and turned her shaking head from one side
to another. All was thick, wet, glistening, confusing.
Only the twitter of the birds and the drip,
drip of the wet leaves broke the deadly stillness.
A nameless horror caught her. She felt alone in
the world.</p>

<p>"O Lord, O dear Lord, show me the way home!"
she prayed. "Let me die at home, Lord; don't let
me die out here&mdash;a poor old woman like me! <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>Sixty two,
Lord, an' a believer all my life! Send me
home!"</p>

<p>There was a little rustling noise in the tree near
the tiny clearing just before her; a low, soft
heavenly sound.</p>

<p>"I know I'm goin' to die, Lord, only let me die
at home! Don't do it here! I'm scairt, an' I'm
weak, an' I'm too old to die in the woods! Jus'
send me home, Lord; show me where the house is!"</p>

<p>The great sun suddenly sent a long, bright ray
down across the open space, and as she looked at it,
there hovered, full in the brightness, a gleaming
silver dove. With wings outspread, motionless, too
bright to look at with steady eyes, it hovered there.
It never fluttered its wings; it made no sound; in
a ray from heaven it held its quiet position
serenely and glistened from every tiniest feather.</p>

<p>The old woman's knees tottered beneath her.
She held with both hands to the gnarled staff, and
shuddered as she gazed.</p>

<p>"The Holy Ghost! The Holy Ghost!" she
panted. The bird's eyes met hers, and she could
not take her own away. To her blurred, smarting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
vision it seemed that an aureole of glory outlined
its head. She had no thoughts; only a confused
sensation of immediate and inescapable doom.
Death, death here, with this grave and moveless
vision was her part. She closed her eyes and
waited. A second, and she opened them, to see the
vision changed; the bird had turned around, and
was slowly guiding down the little clearing before
her. Just above her head it flew, with steady pace,
and with it went all the brightness of the sun.</p>

<p>Her lips moved. She took a step forward, and
the bird advanced. "Glory be to God!" she whispered,
"It'll show me the way!"</p>

<p>She never took her aching eyes for one second
from the wonderful white thing. She scorned to
watch the ground. With a magnificent faith she
walked, her head lifted, her heart too full
to know if she stumbled. In the clear places, always
where there were no branches, the white guide
flew and Harriet walked after with her staff. A
few moments took them out of the wood, but she
never looked for the house. In the full glare of
day, against the blue, the bird looked only snowier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
and to her dazzled, burning eyes the aureole grew
only brighter and bigger. She could not see its
wings move; it hovered steadily and floated serenely
upon the clear air, and the old woman saw
it, and it only.</p>

<p>She did not see the anxious crowd on the porch,
she did not hear their exclamations, she did not
know that her lips were moving, that her voice,
low, husky, but distinguishable, repeated over and
over, almost mechanically: "Forgive me, Lord!
forgive me, Lord! O Lord, forgive me!"</p>

<p>She only followed, followed with all her heart
and soul and strength, up the little hill, up the
path, up to the porch, a strange, shaking pilgrim,
leaning heavily on her staff, guided by the white
pigeon.</p>

<p>On the steps they received her, and as she sank
on the lowest, they caught her, falling. Her almost
sightless eyes were yet uplifted, and while to their
view the dove dropped down among its mates,
a patch among the white, to her it was mingled
with the summer blue, and vanished in the sky
whence it came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Her body was utterly exhausted, but her spirit
could not yet lose its consciousness. On the wave of
her exaltation she rose higher and higher. She
looked at them with a look they had never seen
in any human being.</p>

<p>"I'm saved! I'm saved!" she cried.</p>

<p>They watched her, silent, terrified, awed beyond
words at this redemption they could only feel but
could not understand. But as they stared, her eyes
glazed, her head fell back against the matron's
arm.</p>

<p>"Pray! pray!" she whispered. The pastor looked
at her and steadied himself. Wonder and a sense
of strength flowed in on him suddenly. But there
was scant time for prayer. Though the light in her
face had not yet died away, her breath was scarcely
moving. He came near her and repeated gently
the hymn she had in the time of her trouble disowned,
but which she had always loved:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"<i>Praise God from whom all blessings flow,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Praise Him all creatures here below,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Praise Him above ye heavenly host</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Her eyes opened and looked wide into the blue;
what she saw there they did not know, but she
smiled faintly.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"<i>Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!</i>"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>"Oh, yes! Oh, yes!" the matron guessed that
she murmured; and with the cooing and clucking
of pigeons sounding through the summer air, she
died.</p>

<p>A white, arrow-swift creature whirred through
the stillness, up, up, and out in a great proud
curve; their eyes were too dim to know if it turned
again to the earth.</p>

<h2 id="A_BAYARD_OF_BROADWAY">A BAYARD OF BROADWAY</h2></div>


<p>The younger man&mdash;he was only a boy&mdash;grinned
impishly at the elder, bringing out the
two dimples in his flushed, girlish cheeks.</p>

<p>"That's all right enough, Dill," he drawled; he
always drawled when he had been drinking. When
he was sober the familiar Huntington staccato
was very marked in him.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Dilly, my boy, and a grand
truth, as old Jim used to tell us at chapel, but
maybe little Robert doesn't see your game? Oh,
yes, he sees it, fast enough. Sis hands it out to
you, and you recite it to Robbie, and Robbie reforms,
and you get Sis! How's that for a young
fellow who flunks his math? Not bad, eh?"</p>

<p>Dillon flushed and set his teeth, mastering an
almost irresistible longing to slap those red cheeks
in vicious alternation. To think that this chattering
young idiot stood between him and his heart's
desire!</p>

<p>Bob drawled on: "Anyhow, Dill, I think it's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
right queer, you know. Why don't she marry you?
She can't love you very much, if it depends on
me. You're a man o' the world, you know, man o'
world"&mdash;he grew absent-minded and stared at the
wall. Dillon snapped his fingers nervously, and the
speaker began again with a start:</p>

<p>"That's what I say&mdash;a man o' world. Tell her
it's all bosh worryin' over me, tell her that, Dill,
tell her I say so. No use her tryin' to be my mother.
Now is there, Dill, as a man, is there? If she got
married and had some children of her own&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bob," the older man burst out, "for heaven's
sake, shut up, will you, and listen to me! I'm
going to tell you the truth. You've got the whole
thing in your hands&mdash;God knows why, but you
have&mdash;and I'm going to lay it before you once
for all. Then do as you please: make us all happy,
or go to the devil your own way&mdash;and I'll go
mine," he added, lower and quicker.</p>

<p>Bob sat up, blinked rapidly, and smoothed his
hair down tight over his ears&mdash;sure sign that he
was nearly himself.</p>

<p>"Go ahead," he said shortly, "I'll come in."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Dillon bit his lip a moment; he would rather
have taken a whipping than say what he had to
say. The clock ticked loud in the pause, and Bob,
every moment clearer-eyed, heavy sleep a thing of
the past, stared at him disconcertingly.</p>

<p>"What I'm going to say to you," Dillon began,
"isn't very often said by one man to another, I
imagine. Few men are placed in just my position.
I've known you all so well, I've seen so much of
you all my life&mdash;&mdash;" he paused.</p>

<p>"I needn't say how much I thought of your
mother. When your father was&mdash;when he broke
down so often at the last, of course I saw a great
deal of her, and she trusted me a lot&mdash;she had to,
once she began. When she died, and you weren't
there, because you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't! please don't, Dill!" the boy's lips contracted;
his slim body twisted with a helpless remorse.</p>

<p>"Well, then, when she died she asked me to look
out for you, because she knew how I loved her and&mdash;and
Helena. She knew you had it in you, and
she didn't blame you&mdash;they never do, I suppose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
mothers&mdash;but she asked me if I'd try to look out
for you. She knew I wasn't perfect myself. That's&mdash;that's
why she thought I wouldn't do for
Helena. Helena was always so wonderful, so high
above&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again he stopped, and the boy's voice broke in:</p>

<p>"Helena's made of snow and ice-water," he said
moodily, "she's too good for this earth. She doesn't
know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She knows what her brother should be, and she
knows what her husband must be," Dillon interrupted
sternly. "No sister could have been more
of an angel to you, Bob.</p>

<p>"Now I'll go on. It's going to be necessary just
here for me to tell you that I love your sister.
You don't know anything about that, of course.
You don't for a second of your life realise what
it is to love a woman as I've loved her for&mdash;for
five years, we'll say. I put it five because, though
I loved her long before, things happened in between,
and I don't count it till five years ago.
Heaven knows I'm not worth her shoe-laces. Once
or twice&mdash;before the five years&mdash;I've realised that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
a little too much, and then&mdash;the things happened.
But since then I've honestly tried to keep to the
mark your mother set me. She said to me once,
'If you would only keep as good as you are at
your best, Lawrence, you'd be good enough for
Helena,' and&mdash;perhaps because that wasn't so very
good, after all&mdash;I've really been keeping there,
after a fashion."</p>

<p>Bob stared at him in unaffected amazement.
This clubman, this elegant, this social arbiter
was standing before him with tears in his level
grey eyes. It dawned upon his reckless young soul
that the soul of another man was slowly and painfully
stripping itself before him.</p>

<p>"We'll let that part of it go," Dillon went on
hurriedly, "you couldn't see. I&mdash;I think I could
make her happy, Bob. I know her better than she
thinks. She almost said she'd have me, and then
you went on that spree. You nearly broke her
heart&mdash;I needn't go over it. Only she made a vow,
then&mdash;it was when she went into that convent-place
in Holy Week, and she's never been the
same since&mdash;and it was about you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
"About me? What d'you mean?"</p>

<p>"She told me she never could marry till she was
certain whether you were just obstinate and wild,
or&mdash;or like your father; and that in that case&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, in that case?" Bob muttered through
his teeth.</p>

<p>"She was going to devote her life to taking care
of you."</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>"There's no use in going over all the arguments
now, Bob&mdash;you know what the doctor said.
Three months without a drop, and then he'd warrant
you. Every day that goes by makes it harder
for you. And here's your Uncle Owen promising
that the first month you go without a spree he'll
send you for a three months' cruise on the yacht
with Stebbins&mdash;you know what a chance that
is."</p>

<p>Bob looked fairly up for the first time.</p>

<p>"Stebbins! Would Stebbins go? I don't believe
you!" he cried eagerly.</p>

<p>"He told me he would," said Dillon.</p>

<p>"Why on earth should he?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
"He's a friend of mine," the other answered simply.</p>

<p>Bob twisted his lips together a moment, while
the muscles around his mouth worked. Suddenly
he gave way and broke into sobbing speech.</p>

<p>"You're a good fellow, Dill&mdash;I'm not worth it&mdash;truly,
I'm not! I've been a beast&mdash;and the college
and all that&mdash;you all despise me&mdash;but so do I!"</p>

<p>He gripped the chair, turning his handsome,
tear-stained face up to his friend's. How the
straight, thin nose, the black-lashed blue eyes, the
white forehead reflected Helena! Dillon could have
kissed him for the likeness.</p>

<p>"Will you, Bob? Will you? We'll all stand by
you!"</p>

<p>"I will, Dillon, I will, so help me&mdash;Bob!" he
smiled through wet lashes. "You hang on, and I
will! But look out for that rector&mdash;he's running
a close second, and Aunt Sarah's backing him for
all she's worth!" He was smiling wisely now; the
strain was lifted, and he was almost himself again.
Dillon scowled.</p>

<p>"He takes her slumming, you know, and, say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
you ought to hear him give it to Aunt Sarah
about knowing the condition the poor devils are
in before you deal out the tracts, you know. He
wants the good ladies and gentlemen to come and
see&mdash;that way, you know."</p>

<p>"He's right enough there," Dillon said constrainedly,
"and I suppose he's better for her than
I'd be&mdash;no, by George, he's not! Bob, I tell you,
I know her better than he does&mdash;I tell you I've
waited five years&mdash;Oh, Lord, I can't talk any more
about it!"</p>

<p>They went out arm in arm, the boy warm and
friendly, proud of his confidence and full of high
resolve, Dillon impassive outwardly, but conscious
of great stakes. To say, in four short weeks, to
those wide, blue eyes, a little scornful, perhaps,
but with so sweet, so pure a scorn! "<i>The strain is
over: he is safe; can you not trust me now?</i>" His
heart leaped and grew large at the thought.</p>

<p>It was so like Helena, this service, half-sacred
in her mother's trust, half-shy in maidenly delaying.
"She is afraid of me!" he thought exultingly&mdash;indeed,
she admitted as much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
"You and your set&mdash;one knows you, and yet
one doesn't," she said to him. "You seem so still,
so satisfied, so sure about life&mdash;there seems to be
so much you don't tell! Do you see what I mean?
It frightens me. There is so much we don't think
the same about, Lawrence&mdash;so much of you I don't
know! I wanted, when I married, to come into a&mdash;a
peace. I wanted it to be&mdash;don't laugh&mdash;like my
Confirmation: do you think it would, if I married
you? Do you, Lawrence?"</p>

<p>He turned his head away. A vision of her, those
ten short years ago, in white procession down the
aisle of Easter lilies, rapt and aloof, flashed before
him. For one sweet second he saw her in fancy,
again in white, but trembling now, and near
him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, dearest child," he begged, "I don't know
about the peace&mdash;how can I? The things are so
different! But we could be happy&mdash;I know we
could! Is peace all you want, sweetheart, all?"</p>

<p>Caught by his eyes, her own wavered and
dropped; a flood of red rose to her hair.</p>

<p>"Don't, Lawrence, you frighten me! When you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
look like that&mdash;Oh, wait a month, only this month,
Lawrence, till Bob has gone and we're sure!"</p>

<p>"You want that more than anything else, don't
you? You'd give up anything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her eyes grew soft, then stern, and looked
clearly into his.</p>

<p>"Anything in the world," she said instantly,
"so that mamma could see he was&mdash;safe. I am all
Bob has. Oh, if he can only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He shall," Dillon assured her stoutly, "he
shall, this time!"</p>

<p>And indeed it seemed that he would. He
seemed awakened to the strongest effort they had
known him to make. His uncle's offer, grimly set
for one month from its date, or never, took on for
him a superstitious colour of finality. He was convinced
that it was his last chance.</p>

<p>"If I'm downed this time, Dill, it's all up," he
would say, wearily, as they paced the endless city
blocks together, arm in arm, under the night. "If
I can keep up till the yacht&mdash;how long is it, a
week?&mdash;then, something tells me I'm all right. I
swear it's so. I never felt that before. But if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
don't"&mdash;he paused ominously. "There's always
one way out," he added.</p>

<p>"You will break Helena's heart, then."</p>

<p>"Heart? I don't think she has one. If she had,
you'd have had her long ago. Oh, no, I sha'n't.
She'll go into that beastly retreat for a while, and
then she'll marry that crazy rector-man and go
about saving souls. You'll see."</p>

<p>The week was nearly up. The yacht was ready
in the harbour. The boy, though, showed the
strain, and Dillon, fearful of too much dogging
him, and warned by his furtive eyes and narrowed
lips, called in Stebbins to the rescue.</p>

<p>"I can't have him hate me, Steb," he explained.
"We're both of us worn pretty thin. If you could
give up to-day and to-night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>They shook hands.</p>

<p>"It's every minute, practically, you know,
Steb," he added doubtfully, "it's a good deal."</p>

<p>"Oh, get on!" the other broke in, with a good-natured
shoulder clap.</p>

<p>As he swung the glass door of the club behind
him, Dillon ran down a messenger-boy, bulging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
with yellow envelopes. The boy glanced at him
questioningly.</p>

<p>"Mist' Wardwell, Adams, Stebbins, 'r Waite?"
he inquired, holding out four telegrams as he
slipped in.</p>

<p>Dillon shook his head, and walked down the
steps.</p>

<p>One more night and she would be all to win, no
promise between, no scruple that a lover might not
smother. Shame on him if he could not woo more
persuasively than a mystical evangelist! In the
evening he would see her; the precious little note
lay warm over his heart.</p>

<p>He dined alone, he could not have said where,
and an idle impulse for the lights and bustle of
the great thoroughfare sent him strolling down
Broadway. It was too early for the crowd, and he
found himself guessing vaguely as to the characteristics
of the couples that met and passed him.
That tall, slender lad, for instance, with such a
hint of Bob&mdash;poor, troublesome Bob!&mdash;in his
loose, telltale swagger, what had led him to the
dark-eyed creature that tapped her high heels be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>side
him? As she came under the light, one saw
better; her flashing smile, her careless carriage of
the head, her broad sweep of shoulder, had a certain
charm&mdash;great heavens, it was Bob steadying
himself on her arm! A moment, and the familiar
drawl reached his ear:</p>

<p>"An' so you always want to choose mos' prom'nent
place, every time, an' you're safe's a church.
No chance to meet y'r dear frien's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dillon strode to his side, raising his hat to the
surprised woman.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Bob, but had you forgotten
your engagement this evening?" he said
smoothly. Bob stopped, glared a moment uncertainly,
but the scrupulous courtesy of Dillon's
bearing had its intended effect.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what engagement?" he inquired suspiciously.
"Friend o' mine," he added to his companion.</p>

<p>"Haven't you met Stebbins? He&mdash;he was expecting
you." Lawrence felt his heart sink. Where
was Stebbins? Oh, fool, to have lost hold at the
eleventh hour!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
"Stebbins? Stebbins?" Bob murmured to himself.
"Ah, yes; the beastly boat got afire, and he
had to go down; I'm going too, after a while&mdash;too
early yet&mdash;take a little walk, first, with Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;&mdash;"
He paused, and stared thoughtfully at
the woman. "I don't seem to just recall your
name," he said pleasantly. "Would you mind telling
me, so that I can introduce you? Bad form,
his poking in, though, terribly bad form."</p>

<p>Dillon noted with anger that Bob was at his
most argumentative, obstinate stage; at this point,
if he felt the necessity, he could speak most correctly
and clearly, by giving some thought to the
matter, and it was almost impossible to alter his
determinations.</p>

<p>"My name is Williams," said the woman. Dillon
bowed.</p>

<p>"What have you had, Bob?" he inquired, moving
along with them.</p>

<p>"Oh, only a cocktail&mdash;here and there&mdash;Miss&mdash;Miss
Willis likes 'em as well as anything. About
time we had another?" he suggested, eyeing Lawrence
combatively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
The older man stopped dead. A weary despair
of the whole business seized him. It was all up,
then. Even if he went about with the boy, which
Bob would hardly allow, his condition next morning
would be all too apparent. And then Uncle
Owen would wash his hands of it all. Aunt Sarah
would never consent to any institutional cure.
Helena would never marry while Bob needed
her&mdash;thank God, she had never suspected the
woman!</p>

<p>As if in answer to his thoughts, Bob complained
loudly:</p>

<p>"I say it's a blamed shame, the first time I go
out with a girl to enjoy the evening, to have you
pokin' in, Dill! Always stuck with the fellows before;
and now I get a girl, like anybody else, and
here you come! Why don't you get out? Two's
company."</p>

<p>Dillon caught his arm.</p>

<p>"Bob," he said beseechingly, "you don't know
what you're doing. Surely you know what this
means! Don't you remember that the Eider-duck
sails to-morrow at nine? Don't you realise that by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
this night's folly you're losing your last chance?
Your last chance, Bob! Think how you called it
that yourself! If this lady realised all this meant
to you, she'd excuse you, I'm sure. Don't be a fool,
Bob! Let me put you in a cab and go right to
Stebbins&mdash;old Steb'll put you up, and nobody will
ever know! You can sleep it off&mdash;it's only eight
o'clock."</p>

<p>To his unexpected delight Bob yawned sleepily.
His eyes were dull, his mouth drooped.</p>

<p>"Sleep it off," he murmured. "I wish I was in
bed this minute. Lord, I'm tired. And I know why,
too. I told her bromo-seltzer would settle me. Always
puts me to sleep&mdash;no good at all. Fool to
drink it. Told her so...."</p>

<p>Dillon's spirits rose.</p>

<p>"That's so," he assented, "it always acts that
way with you, doesn't it? Especially with cocktails.
Now, you be a wise man, Bob," he urged,
"and get into this cab&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And where do I come in?" said the woman
sharply. "I call this a little queer, if you don't
mind my saying so."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Bob roused himself for a moment.</p>

<p>"Just so," he declared heavily, "just so.
Where does Miss Willard come in? You must think
I'm a terrible cad, Dill, to ask a lady out for
the evening, and leave her like that! Not a bit
of it! You go on! Sorry, but can't leave the
lady."</p>

<p>Lawrence moved toward his pocket involuntarily.
The woman struck his arm lightly.</p>

<p>"That'll do," she said sullenly. "I don't want
your money. You think I'm a kind of a bundle, do
you? Pick me up and drop me. Well, that's where
you make a mistake. Why don't you let your
friend alone?"</p>

<p>"Helen&mdash;she'll know. You say nobody will,"
Bob broke in suddenly. "She won't lie, if you will.
She'll tell Uncle Owen. What's the use?"</p>

<p>"I won't tell her," Lawrence returned quickly,
"and nobody else knows."</p>

<p>"Well, then," Bob faced him cunningly, walking
backwards through the comparatively empty
cross-street they had turned down, "I think maybe
I'll do it. I want to go with Stebbins, all right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
But"&mdash;his obstinacy rose again, suddenly&mdash;"I
swear I won't go back on a lady! Nobody offer a
lady money in my presence! 'Twon't do, Dill! Get
out!"</p>

<p>"Bob," Lawrence urged, despairingly, "if I
take Miss Williams wherever she wants to go, and
she will accept my escort"&mdash;he half turned to her,
but his doubt was not evident, if he had it&mdash;"will
you go to Stebbins?"</p>

<p>Bob stopped short, nearly falling backwards.</p>

<p>"Great head!" he cried. "Never thought old
Dilly had it in him! I'll&mdash;I'll consider the prop&mdash;the
prop&mdash;the plan." He yawned widely. "I certainly
am sleepy," he observed, sinking on a convenient
step.</p>

<p>Dillon shook him and dragged him up.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, shortly, "will you?"</p>

<p>Bob pointed a theatrical finger at them.</p>

<p>"Do you, Dilly, being of sound mind, body, or
estate, give me your solemn word of honour as a
gentleman to escort Miss Willins wherever she
wants to go? Do you?"</p>

<p>"And drop me when your back's turned," inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>posed
the woman, laconically, but not angrily.
Her interest was awakened, perhaps her sense of
humour, too, and she awaited developments philosophically.</p>

<p>"Never a bit," Bob returned. "You don't know
old Dill. If he says it, he'll do it, if there were
what-do-you-call-'ems in the way."</p>

<p>"I give you my word of honour," said Lawrence,
steadily.</p>

<p>"And you'll never tell Helen? Because if you
do, she tells Uncle Owen, and it's all up with
Robbie."</p>

<p>"I will never tell her."</p>

<p>"On your word of honour?"</p>

<p>"On my word of honour."</p>

<p>"Then call your cab and tuck me in my little
bed. My eyes will crack if I prop 'em up any
longer."</p>

<p>"Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;I can't recall your name, but you
don't object?..."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I don't object in the least," said Miss
Williams satirically, with a wondering glance at
the tall, immaculate gentleman at her side, his face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
stern in the electric-light, his evening clothes in
marked contrast to Bob's neglige. "In fact, I
rather&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dillon whistled a cab and gave the driver whispered
directions. A bill fluttered as he passed it
up. The man nodded, respectful.</p>

<p>"And now I am at your service," said Dillon,
standing tall and straight before her. "Where did
you wish to go?"</p>

<p>Not for one moment did it occur to him to evade
his duty, and not for one moment did she intend
that he should. Where they went, through all that
nightmare evening, he could never afterward tell.
From dance-hall to concert-hall they wandered,
sat awhile, and departed. Nor were they silent on
the way. What they spoke of he could not have
told for his life, but they talked, fairly steadily
at first, less and less as the night wore on, and the
woman grew dreamily content with the lights, the
warmth, and the liquor. Dillon was imperturbably
polite, gravely attentive to her wishes, curiously
conscious of one life with her and another distinct
existence at Helena's home. Now he was waiting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
waiting, waiting in front of the close-shaded windows
to see if she had left the house or if she still
sat in surprised idleness expecting him. Now he
was at Stebbins's house watching Bob as he lay
asleep there.</p>

<p>He remembered afterward thinking that the
woman must have been a Southerner, for, as she
drank, her tongue turned to those softer tones,
slurred vowels and quaint idioms.</p>

<p>"It seems like you're having a good time, after
all," she said once. He bowed gravely.</p>

<p>By eleven they were well down-town, he was not
quite certain where. They stayed but little time in
any one place. It seemed as if they had been on
this endless journey for years. Now and then he
saw a man he knew. In one place he wakened,
with a shock of remembrance, to the fact that he
had been there before: there, and at the place opposite,
too. How little it had changed! It was before
the five years....</p>

<p>They were at a corner table, he with his back
to the room, the woman facing it. On a platform
opposite a young fellow sat before a piano, strik<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>ing
desultory chords. Presently he began to sing,
in a sweet, piercing tenor:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"<i>Oh, promise me that some day you and I</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There was a moved silence through the room;
his voice had a quality that reached for the
heart:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"<i>Those first sweet violets of early spring</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Dillon glanced at the woman; her large, dark
eyes were brimmed with tears. A great pity surged
over him: he would have given anything he owned
to be able to offer her her life to live again. Tenderly,
as over a dusty, broken bird, he laid his
hand over her clasped ones on the table. They sat
in awed silence; the song swelled on. He did not
hear the door open behind him, nor turn as a new
party of four entered quietly. Directly behind his
chair a man's voice spoke softly.</p>

<p>"This is a fair sample. Not very bad, you think?
But every man in this room is a confirmed opium-eater,
and the women&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The two at the table hardly heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
"Oh, the women!" said a woman's voice in a
rough whisper. "I cannot bear to think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't the women, Aunty! You sha'n't
say that&mdash;they are heart-breaking. It's the men,
the men I bl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Swiftly, hopelessly, as the steel turns to the
magnet, Dillon turned and faced Helena Huntington.</p>

<p>As her eyes met his all the rose colour in her
soft cheeks seemed to sweep into his and burn
dully there, leaving her whiter than bone. For one
fiery second her eyes rested on the table, the half-emptied
glasses, the clasped hands of the pair, the
tear-stained cheeks of the handsome girl. For one
breath two groups of stone confronted each other.
Then, with no sign of recognition, she swept from
her seat, her hand on the rector's arm, her aunt
and an older man behind them. Her aunt looked
at Dillon as if he were the chair he sat in.</p>

<p>The door swung behind them.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"<i>No life so perfect as a life with thee,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Oh, promise me; oh, promise me!</i>"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the tenor shrilled. Lawrence burst into jangling
laughter.</p>

<p>"The evening is over," he said, still red and
shaking. "Allow me to escort you home."</p>

<p>He never remembered the time between this
speech and the moment when she asked him to step
in for a while, and he laughed in her face. Then
there was another time, and he was at his rooms
at the club. But that was early morning. He was
lame and his shoes hurt his feet&mdash;he must have
walked a great deal.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock Stebbins dashed into the
room.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the fellows! What's the matter
with you?"</p>

<p>He was fresh and rosy; a faint, wholesome
aroma of cigars and eau-de-cologne swept in with
him.</p>

<p>"Why the deuce aren't you down to see us off?
They're all there. Got my telegram yesterday?
Fire didn't amount to much, but the fools hadn't
half the stuff I ordered. I was down there all the
afternoon seeing to it. I sent Bob right around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
to you. You must have walked him well. Stevens
said he came in at eight and tumbled straight to
bed. He's fresh as paint this morning. Asked him
where he'd been, and I swear he didn't know. Says
you told him to go to bed, and he went. Drove
home, he says. Actually doesn't remember a living
thing but that, since dinner. When you said he'd
be that way sometimes I didn't really believe you,
but I do now. Where were you?"</p>

<p>Dillon faced him.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, Lawrence, what is it? Are you
sick? She said you wouldn't be there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She? Who?"</p>

<p>"The old one&mdash;the aunt. Bob was wondering
about it, and she says directly, 'No, he won't be
here this morning,' so I slipped off. Bob said if
you were tired, never mind.</p>

<p>"I say, Lawrence, that's an awfully attractive
boy. You can't help liking him. He called me
aside, and, 'Look here,' says he, 'Uncle Owen says
there's to be no wine packed for you. Now I can't
have that, Stebbins, it won't do. It's awfully bully
of you to come, and you must have everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
you want.' I told him that would be all right and
what a fine vacation it was going to be for
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lawrence turned the water into the tub and
began to pull at his shoes. Never had he felt so
grateful for Stebbins's constant chatter.</p>

<p>"I don't believe I'll come down," he heard himself
say. "I have a beastly headache. I didn't get
much sleep&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, for heaven's sake get some, if it makes
you look like that! Where'd you go, anyway, after
you put Bob to bed?"</p>

<p>Lawrence pulled off his coat.</p>

<p>"Parson's down there, you know. He and uncle
seem to be hand in glove. He's pretty well fixed
with most of the family, I shouldn't wonder."</p>

<p>"How much time have you got?" said Lawrence's
voice.</p>

<p>"George, not much! Cab's waiting outside. I
won't mention how you look, then&mdash;just tell 'em
good-bye."</p>

<p>"That's all. Just tell 'em good-bye."</p>

<p>Lawrence was in the bath-room as Stebbins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
hurried out. He sat down on the porcelain rim of
the tub, his face drawn and grey above his white
shirt.</p>

<p>"It seems to be pretty well settled up," he said
quietly. "I hope his mother's pleased!"</p>

<h2 id="A_LITTLE_BROTHER_OF_THE">A LITTLE BROTHER OF THE BOOKS</h2></div>


<p>The new librarian entered upon her duties
bright and early Monday morning. She closed
with a quick snap the little wicket-gate that separated
the books from the outer vestibule, briskly
arranged her paste-tube, her dated stamp, and her
box of slips, and summoned her young assistant
sharply. The assistant was reading <i>Molly Bawn</i>
and eating caramels, and she shut book and bag
quickly, wiping her mouth as she hurried to her
superior.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Mather, I expect to get fifty books
properly labelled and shelved before noon," said
the new librarian, "and there must be no time
wasted. If anyone wants me, I shall be in Section
K," and she turned to go.</p>

<p>Section K was only a few feet from the registering-table,
but it pleased the new librarian to
assume the existence of long corridors of volumes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
with dumb-waiters and gongs and bustling, basket-laden
attendants. So much majesty did she throw
into her sentence, indeed, that the young assistant,
who had always, under the old rgime, privately
referred to Section K as "those old religious
books," and advised the few persons interested in
them to "go right in behind and see if the book
you refer to is there," was staggered for a moment,
and involuntarily glanced behind her, to see
if there had been a recent addition to the building.</p>

<p>The new librarian strode down between the
cases, glancing quickly from side to side to detect
mislaid or hastily shoved-in volumes. Suddenly
she stopped.</p>

<p>"What are you doing in here, little boy?" she
said abruptly.</p>

<p>In the angle of the case marked "Books of
Travel, Adventure, etc.," seated upon a pile of
encyclopdias, with his head leaning against
<i>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</i>, was a
small boy. He was dark of eyes and hair, palely
sallow, ten or eleven years old, to appearance. By
his side leaned a crutch, and a clumsy wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
boot, built up several inches from the sole, explained
the need of this. A heavy, much-worn
book was spread across his little knees.</p>

<p>He looked up vaguely, hardly seeming to see
the librarian.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here? How did you get
in?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"I'm reading," he replied, not offering to rise,
"I just came in."</p>

<p>"But this isn't the place to read. You must go
in the reading-room," she admonished him.</p>

<p>"I always read here. I'd rather," he said, pleasantly
enough, dropping his eyes to his book, as
if the matter were closed.</p>

<p>Now the new librarian thoroughly disapproved
of the ancient custom that penned the books away
from all handling, and fully intended to throw
them open to the public in a few months' time,
when she should have them properly systematised;
but she resented this anticipation of what she intended
for a much-appreciated future privilege.</p>

<p>"But why should you read in here, when none
of the other children can?" she demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
The boy raised his eyes again.</p>

<p>"Mr. Littlejohn lets me&mdash;I always do," he repeated.</p>

<p>The new librarian pressed her lips together
with an air of highly creditable restraint.</p>

<p>"Mr. Littlejohn allowed a great many irregularities
which have been stopped," she announced,
"and as there is no reason why you should do
what the other children cannot, you will have to
go. So hurry up, for I'm very busy this morning."</p>

<p>She did not speak unkindly, but there was an
unmistakable decision in her tone, and the boy got
up awkwardly, tucked his crutch under his arm,
and laying the big book down with care, went out
in silence, his heavy boot echoing unevenly on the
hardwood floor. The librarian went on to Section
K.</p>

<p>Presently the young assistant, who had been accustomed
to keep her crocheted lace-work on the
Philosophical shelf, directly behind the <i>Critique of
Pure Reason</i>, recollected that it would in all human
probability be discovered, on the removal of
that epoch-making treatise, and came hastily down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
to get it. Having concealed it safely in her pocket,
she paused.</p>

<p>"That was Jimmy Reese you sent out&mdash;did you
know it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, what of it?"</p>

<p>"Why, nothing, only he's always read in here
ever since I came. Mr. Littlejohn was very fond
of him. He helped pick out some of the books.
He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Picked out the books&mdash;that child? Great
heavens!"</p>

<p>"Well, he's read a good deal, Jimmy has," the
assistant contended. "It's all he does. He can't play
like the other children, he's so lame. He seems real
old, anyhow. And he's always been here. He helps
giving out the books, and helps the children pick
out. He was very convenient when Mr. Littlejohn
didn't like to be waked up."</p>

<p>"Great heavens!" the librarian cried again.</p>

<p>"I think you'll find he'll be missed, you being
so new," the assistant persevered.</p>

<p>"I think I can manage to carry on the library,
Miss Mather," replied her superior coldly, "with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>out
any assistance from the children of the town.
Will you begin on that Fiction, please?"</p>

<p>She walked on again, but paused to put away
the brown book, which lay where the intruder had
left it, a mute witness to the untidiness of the laity.
Opening it briskly, she glanced at the title:</p>


<p class="p2 center break-before">
The<br />
AGE OF FABLE</p>
<p class="center">or</p>

<p class="center smcap">Beauties of Mythology</p>

<p class="center">by</p>

<p class="center smcap">Thomas Bulfinch</p>

<p class="p2">Below was a verse of poetry in very fine print;
she read it mechanically.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><i>O, ye delicious fables! where the wave</i></div>

<div class="line i12"><span class="smcap">Barry Cornwall.</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It flashed into her mind that an absolutely
shameless subscriber had retained Miss Proctor's
collected poems for three weeks now, and she made
a hasty note of the fact on a small pad that hung
from her belt. Then she set the <i>Age of Fable</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
in its place and went on about her work, the incident
dismissed.</p>

<p>The next afternoon as she was sorting out from
the department labelled, "Poetry, Miscellaneous
Matter, etc.," such books as Mr. Littlejohn had
found himself unable or unwilling to classify further,
shaking down much dust on the further side
of the shelves in the process, she was startled by a
faint sneeze. Her assistant was compiling a list of
fines at the desk, and this sneeze came from her
very elbow, it seemed, so she hastily dismounted
from her little ladder and peered around the rack.
There sat the little boy of yesterday, the same
brown book spread across his knees. She looked
severe.</p>

<p>"Is this Jimmy Reese?" she inquired stiffly.</p>

<p>"Yes'm," he answered, with a polite smile. He
had an air of absolute unconsciousness of any
offence.</p>

<p>"Well, don't you remember what I told you
yesterday, Jimmy? This is not the reading-room.
Why don't you go there?"</p>

<p>"I like it better here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>The librarian sighed despairingly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't know who I am," she explained,
not crossly, but with that air of detachment
and finality that many people assume in
talking with children. "I am Miss Watkins, the
new librarian, and when I give an order here it
must be obeyed. When I tell any one to do anything,
I expect them to do it, because&mdash;because
they must," she concluded lamely, a little disconcerted
by the placid stare of the brown eyes. "You
see, if all the little boys came in here, there would
be no room for us to work."</p>

<p>"But they don't&mdash;nobody comes but me," he reminded
her.</p>

<p>"Suppose," she demanded, "that someone should
call for that book you are reading. I shouldn't
know where to look for it."</p>

<p>"Nobody ever wants it but me," he assured her
again.</p>

<p>"I have no time to argue," she said irritably,
"you must do as I tell you. Put the book up and
run away."</p>

<p>Without another word he laid the book on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
broad base-shelf, picked up his crutch, and went
out. As she watched his retreating figure, a little
uneasy feeling troubled her usual calm. He seemed
so small, so harmless a person.</p>

<p>A little later it occurred to her to see how he had
entered the library, and stepping through the two
smaller rooms at the back, choked and dusty with
neglected piles of old magazines, she noticed a
door ajar. Picking her way through the chaos,
she pulled the knob, and saw that it gave on a
tiny back porch. On the steps sat the janitor, as
incompetent, from the librarian's point of view,
as his late employer.</p>

<p>"I thought you were sweeping off the walks,
Thomas," she suggested, coughing as the wreaths
from his pipe reached her.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, Miss Watkins, so I was. I just
stopped a minute to rest, you see," he explained,
eyeing her distrustfully. Since her advent life had
changed greatly for the janitor.</p>

<p>"I see Thomas, does that little lame boy come
in this way?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jimmy? Yes, ma'am. 'Most always he does. In
fact, that's why I keep the door unlocked."</p>

<p>"Well, after this I prefer that you should keep
it locked. There is no reason why he should have
a private entrance to the library that I can see;
and anyway it's not safe. Some one might&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, Miss Watkins, don't you worry.
Nobody ever came in here yet, and I've been here
eight years. Jimmy's all right. He's careful and
still's a mouse, and he won't do a mite of harm.
He comes in regular after school's out, and it's
just like a home to him, you may say. He's all
right."</p>

<p>Miss Watkins frowned.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt that he is a very estimable
little boy," she said; "but you will please see that
no one enters the library by this door. I see no
reason for favouritism. You understand me, I
hope."</p>

<p>And she returned to her work. The assistant,
weary of her unprecedented labour, had laid aside
the list of fines, and was openly crocheting. No
sound of broom or lawn-mower proclaimed Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
worthy of his hire, and Miss Watkins, vexed beyond
the necessity of the case, labelled Fiction
angrily, wondering why such a town as this needed
a library, anyway.</p>

<p>Two little old ladies, plump and deprecatory,
entered in a swish of fresh, cambric morning-dresses.
One of them fumbled in her black-silk
bag for a book, and leaning on the little gate,
coughed lightly to attract the assistant's attention.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, Miss Mather, a lovely day. Sister
and I enjoyed this very much. I don't know about
what we'll take, exactly; it's so hard to tell. I always
look and look, and the more I look the more
anxious I get. It always seems as if everything
was going to be too long, or else we've read it.
You see we read a good deal. I wonder&mdash;do you
know where the little boy is?"</p>

<p>Miss Mather smiled triumphantly. "You'll have
to ask Miss Watkins," she said.</p>

<p>"The new librarian, my dear? Oh, I hardly like
to disturb her. They say she's very strict. My
cousin told me she charged her nine cents for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
book that was out too long. You ask her, my
dear!"</p>

<p>"Miss Watkins," said the assistant meekly,
"there is a lady here would like to see Jimmy. Do
you know where he is?"</p>

<p>"I do not," the librarian returned briefly. "Anything
I can do&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not at all!" cried the flushed old lady,
"not for the world! Don't disturb yourself, please&mdash;Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;I'll
just wait till he gets in. He
picked this out for me. You see, he knows pretty
well what we want. I always like something with
a little travel in it, and sister won't hear of a
book unless it ends well. And it spoils it so to look
ahead. So the little fellow looks at the end, and
sees if it's all right for sister, and then he assures
me as to the travel&mdash;I like European travel best&mdash;and
then we know it's all right. I'll just wait
for him."</p>

<p>"I have no reason to suppose that he will be
here," Miss Watkins said crossly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he'll be here," the old lady returned
comfortably. "He'll be here soon. We can wait."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>The librarian pressed her lips together and retired
into her work. The minutes passed. Presently
the outer door opened softly, and the irregular tap
of a crutch was heard. Jimmy's head peered
around the partition into the ante-room. The old
ladies uttered a chirp of delight, and slipped out
into the hall for a brief, whispered consultation,
returning with a modest request for "<i>Griffith
Gaunt</i>, by Charles Reade." The elder of the two
shut it carefully into her bag, remarking sociably,
"I wanted to read the <i>Cloister and the Hearth</i>, by
the same author, I'd heard there was so much
travel in it, but he said sister never could bear
the ending."</p>

<p>Going into the reading-room later, on some
errand, the librarian was surprised to find the
magazines neatly laid out in piles, the chairs
straightened, the shades pulled level, and a fresh
bunch of lilacs in the jar under the window. She
guessed who had done it, but Jimmy was not to
be seen. Once, during the next afternoon, she
thought she saw a small, grey jacket disappearing
into the waste-room, but much to her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
surprise, forbore to make certain of it. During the
next few days, when her time was entirely taken
up with the catalogue in the front of the library,
and the assistant transacted all business among the
shelves, she was perfectly convinced that somewhere
between sections A and K a little boy with
a brown book was concealed, but found herself
too busy to rout him out.</p>

<p>Even when a red-faced, liveried coachman presented
her with a note, directed in a sprawling,
childish hand to "Mr. Jimmy Reese, Esq.," she
only coughed and said severely, "There is no such
official in the library."</p>

<p>"It's just the little boy, ma'am, that's meant,"
the man explained deferentially. "Master Clarence
is back for the summer&mdash;Mrs. Clarence Vanderhoof,
ma'am&mdash;and he always sends a note to the
little fellow. There was some book he mentioned
to him last year as likely that he would enjoy, and
Master Clarence wants it, if it's in. I was to give
him the note."</p>

<p>"I will send a list of our juveniles to Mrs.
Vanderhoof," said the librarian, in her most busi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>ness-like
manner, "and I will give you, for Master
Clarence, the new Henty book. He will probably
like that."</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, ma'am," persisted the coachman,
"but Master Clarence says that there was a book
that the little boy particularly recommended to
him, and I was to be very special about it. He
goes a good deal by the little fellow's judgment.
I'll call in again when he's here, after my other
errands."</p>

<p>Miss Watkins sighed, and gave way. "Will you
see, Miss Mather, if Jimmy Reese is in the library?"
she inquired, and Miss Mather, smiling,
obeyed her.</p>

<p>He was never formally enfranchised, but he
took up his place in the department of Travel
and Adventure, and held it unchallenged. All the
long, spring afternoons he sat there, throned on
the books, leaning against them, banked safely in
from the tumult of the world outside, a quiet little
shadow among the shadowy throngs that filled the
covers.</p>

<p>Whatever he might read, for he turned to other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
books as one travels, for the joy of coming home
again, the old brown book lay open on his knees,
and he patted the pages with one hand, absently,
as his eyes travelled over the print. Sooner or
later he came back to the yellowed leaves&mdash;perhaps
to the story of Dryope.</p>

<p class="i2 p2">"<i>Now there was nothing left of Dryope but her
face. Her tears still flowed and fell on her leaves,
and while she could, she spoke. 'I am not guilty.
I deserve not this fate. I have injured no one.
If I speak falsely, may my foliage perish with
drought and my trunk be cut down and burned.
Take this infant and give it to a nurse. Let it
often be brought and nursed under my branches,
and play in my shade; and when he is old enough
to talk, let him be taught to call me mother, and
to say with sadness, "My mother lies hid under this
bark." But bid him be careful of river-banks, and
beware how he plucks flowers, remembering that
every bush he sees may be a goddess in disguise.
Farewell, dear husband and sister and father. If
you retain any love for me, let not the axe wound
me nor the flocks bite and tear my branches. Since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
I cannot stoop to you, climb up hither and kiss
me; and while my lips continue to feel, lift up my
child, that I may kiss him. I can speak no more,
for already the bark advances up my neck, and
will soon shoot over me. You need not close my
eyes; the bark will soon close them without your
aid.' Then the lips ceased to move, and life was
extinct; but the branches retained, for some time
longer, the vital heat.</i>"</p>

<p class="p2">In fancy he walked by that fatal stream. He
saw the plant dripping blood&mdash;the flower that was
the poor nymph Lotis. The terrible, beautiful revenge,
the swift doom of those wonderful Greeks,
that delights even while it horrifies, he felt to the
fullest measure. He had no more need to read them
than a priest his breviary, for he knew them all,
but he followed the type in very delight of recognition.</p>

<p>Through the window came the strong scent of
the purple lilacs, that grew all over the little New
England town. Faint cries of children playing
drifted in with the breeze. The organ in the church
nearby crooned and droned a continual fugue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Someone was always practising there. The deep,
bass notes jarred the air, even the little building
trembled to them at times. And since it had been
at this season of the year, when he had first found
the book, the lovely broken myths, elusive sometimes,
and as dim to his understanding as the marble
fragments that still bewilder the enchanted
artist, he always connected with that throbbing,
mournful melody, that haunting lilac
odour. Sometimes the organ swelled triumphantly
and cried out in a mighty chorus of tone: at those
times Ulysses shot down the false suitors, or Perseus,
hovering over the shrieking sea-beast, rescued
the white Andromeda. Sometimes a minor plaintive
strain troubled him vaguely, and then he listened
to poor Venus, bending in tears above the slain
Adonis.</p>

<p class="p2 i2">"<i>'Yet theirs shall be but a partial triumph;
memorials of my grief shall endure, and the spectacle
of your death, my Adonis, and of my lamentation,
shall be annually renewed. Your blood shall
be turned into a flower; that consolation none shall
envy me.' Thus speaking, she sprinkled nectar on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the blood; and as they mingled, bubbles rose as in
a pool, on which rain-drops fall, and in an hour's
time there sprang up a flower of bloody hue, like
that of the pomegranate. But it is short-lived.</i>"</p>

<p class="p2">The peculiar odour of much leather on pine
shelves was confused, too, with the darling book.
He had never read it elsewhere; he had not money
enough for a library-ticket. Old Mr. Littlejohn,
quickly recognising the invaluable services that
this little acolyte might be counted upon to render,
had readily granted him the freedom of the
shelves, and smoked his pipe in peace for hours
together, thereafter, in the back room, sure of his
monitor in front.</p>

<p>Miss Watkins needed no such assistance, but she
found herself, to her amazement, not wholly ungrateful
for the many steps saved her by Jimmy's
tactful service to the children. At first she would
have none of it, and groups of shy boys and girls
waited awkwardly and in vain before the little
gate, hoping for a glimpse of their kindly counsellor.
She thrust lists of juveniles into their
unwilling hands, led them cautiously into an in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>spection
of Nature Lessons for Little Learners,
displayed tempting rows of bound <i>St. Nicholas</i>&mdash;but
to no purpose.</p>

<p>"Where's Jimmy?" they demanded stubbornly.</p>

<p>"What on earth do they want of him?" she
asked of her assistant one day. "That stupid
Meadows child&mdash;is she going to ask his opinion
of the Dotty Dimple Books?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," Miss Mather replied tranquilly.
"But he always gets her a Mary J. Holmes novel,
and I stamp it and let it go. You always argue
with her about it, and ask her if she wouldn't prefer
something else&mdash;which she never would."</p>

<p>Little by little he grew to wait on the children
as a matter of course. He was even allowed to
keep the novels desired by the Meadows child
in the juvenile shelf, where he insisted they belonged.</p>

<p>"Only the girls in Number Seven want 'em,"
he explained, when his superior complained of
his audacity in removing them from adult fiction.</p>

<p>And so the little girl who had reached that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
period of little girlhood when every well-regulated
young person is compelled by some inward power
to ask the librarian, tremblingly, if she has a book
in the libr'y called <i>St. Elmo</i>, was spared all embarrassment,
for Jimmy handed it out to her almost
before she asked.</p>

<p>Not that he lacked the discrimination to exercise
a proper authority on occasion. Miss Watkins
remembered long a surprising scene which she witnessed
from the top of a ladder in the Biography
and Letters Section. A shambling, unwholesome
boy had asked Miss Mather in a husky voice for
the works of Edgar A. Poe, and as she blew off
the dust from the top and extended two fat volumes
toward him, a rapid tapping heralded the
youngest official.</p>

<p>"Don't you give 'em to him, don't you!" he
cried, warningly. As she paused instinctively he
shook his finger with a quaint, old-fashioned gesture
at the boy.</p>

<p>"You ought to be ashamed, Sam Wheeler," he
said reprovingly. "You shan't take those books a
step. Not a step. If you think you're going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
scare Susy to death you're mistaken. If you want
to read 'em, come here and do it. But you aren't
a-going to read 'em to her nights, again. So you
go right off, now!"</p>

<p>Without a word Sam turned and left the library,
and Miss Watkins from her ladder remonstrated
feebly.</p>

<p>"Why, Jimmy, if that boy has a ticket you
haven't any right&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you know what he does with those books,
Miss Watkins?" replied the dauntless squire of
dames. "He reads 'em after supper to his little sister
Susy. That one where the house all falls down
and the one where the lady's teeth come out and
she carries 'em in her hand! And she don't dare
take her feet off the rungs, she sits so still. And
she don't go to sleep hardly ever. Do you s'pose
I'd let him take 'em?"</p>

<p>The librarian threshed the matter over, and
finally thought to stagger him by the suggestion
that it would be difficult for him to ascertain the
precise intention of everyone drawing out books.
"How do you know," she asked, "that other peo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>ple
may not be frightening each other with various
stories?"</p>

<p>"There aren't many fellows as mean as Sam
Wheeler," he replied promptly, "and then I was
sure that he was going to. I happened to
know."</p>

<p>She turned again to her work and he went back
to his corner, the brown book under his arm.</p>

<p>The syringa was out now, and the mournful,
sweet odour blew in from the bushes around the
church. In the still June air he could hear the bees
buzzing there. He turned the beloved pages idly.
Should it be poor Psyche, so sweet and foolish, or
Dana, the lovely mother, hushing her baby in the
sea-tossed chest? He found the place of Proverbial
Expressions at the back of the book, and read
them with a never-failing interest. Around them he
wove long stories to please himself.</p>

<p class="p2 i2">"<i>Their faces were not all alike, nor yet unlike,
but such as those of sisters ought to be.</i>"</p>

<p class="p2">This one always pleased him&mdash;he could not
have said why.</p>

<p class="i2 p2">"<i>Here lies Phton, the driver of his father's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
chariot, which if he failed to manage, yet he fell
in a great undertaking.</i>"</p>

<p class="p2">The simple grandeur of this one was like the
trumpet tone of the organ. He thrilled to it delightedly.</p>

<p>The third he murmured to himself, entranced
by the very sound of the words:</p>

<p class="p2 i2">"<i>He falls, unhappy, by a wound intended for
another; looks up to the skies, and dying remembers
sweet Argos.</i>"</p>

<p class="p2">Ah, why would Thomas never consent to the
witchery of these words:</p>

<p class="i2 p2">"&mdash;&mdash;<i>and dying remembers sweet Argos.</i>"</p>

<p class="p2">He sighed delightedly and dreamed into the
dusk. Almost he thought he had known that man,
almost he remembered sweet Argos....</p>

<p>In the middle of June the Vanderhoof's coachman
brought bad news: Master Clarence was quite
ill. No one knew what it was exactly, but if there
was any exceptionally fine book that Jimmy could
suggest, he'd be glad to be read to from it.</p>

<p>For the first time the little librarian parted from
his darling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
"If you'll be especially careful of it, William,
and I've put in slips of paper at the best ones.
And as soon as he gets better, I'd be glad if he'd
send it back&mdash;if he's through with it."</p>

<p>The days seemed long without it. The heat was
intense, and when Miss Mather stayed at home a
day or two, and all the summer people came in
for books, he had a great deal to do. Miss Watkins
was very glad of his help, now.</p>

<p>One hot Saturday afternoon he did not return
to the library, but began a resolute journey to the
Vanderhoof's big house on the hill. It was almost
two miles, and he went slowly; now and then he
stopped to rest on the stone horse-blocks. It took
him an hour to get there, and at the door he had
to stop to wipe his forehead and get his breath.</p>

<p>"I came to ask how Clarence was," he said to
the maid.</p>

<p>"He's better, thank you, but it's dreadful sick
he's been. 'Twas scarlet fever, dear," she answered,
with a pitying glance at the crutch. "Not that
you need be worried, for the half of the house is
shut off, and we've not been near it," she added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm glad he's better, and&mdash;and is he through
with the book?" he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"The book? What book is it, my dear? Sure the
nurse does be reading a hundred books to him."</p>

<p>"A brown book: Stories of Gods and Heroes.
I&mdash;I'd like it, if he's through with it. I stay at
the libr'y, and I sent it to him&mdash;" he sank on the
step, exhausted.</p>

<p>The kind-hearted girl dragged him into the
hall. "Come out with me, dear, and get a glass
of cold milk," she said. "You've walked too far."</p>

<p>Seated on a chair in the kitchen, his eyes closed,
he heard, as in a dream, his friend's voice raised
in dispute with some distant person.</p>

<p>"And I say he shall have it, then. Walking all
this way! And him lame, too! Tell Emma to put
it on the tray, and leave it in the hall. The child's
well enough now, anyway. I'll go get it myself&mdash;I'm
not afraid. The whole of us had the fever,
and no such smelling sheets pinned up, and no
fuss at all, at all. I'm as good as a paid nurse, any
day, if you come to that. A book'll hurt no
one."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Later he found himself perched beside the coachman,
who was going to meet a train, the beloved
book tight in his arms. He fingered it lovingly;
he smelled the leaves like a little dog. For the first
time in his life he took it to his home, and clasped
it in his arms as he lay in bed.</p>

<p>For days he did not appear, and it was Thomas,
the janitor, who went finally to look him up,
troubled by the children's reports of his illness.
He returned grave-faced.</p>

<p>"It's the fever, Miss Watkins, and they say
there's little chance for him, the poor little feller!
He was worn out with the heat. They don't know
how he got it. He's out of his mind. To think of
Jimmy like that!"</p>

<p>The librarian's heart sank, and her assistant put
her head on her arms and cried. Thomas sat sadly
on his little porch, his unlighted pipe in his mouth.
The library seemed strangely empty.</p>

<p>The little Meadows girl brought them the news
the next morning.</p>

<p>"Jimmy's dead," she said abruptly. "He got it
from a book up at the Vanderhoof's. His aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
feels awful bad. It was a libr'y book. They say he
held it all the time."</p>

<p>The librarian put away the book in her hand,
envying the younger woman her facile tears. She
was not imaginative, but she realised dimly for a
moment that this little boy had known more of
books, had got more from them, than she, with all
her catalogues.</p>

<p>They sat together, she, Miss Mather, and
Thomas, a strange trio, at the simple funeral service
in the church nearby. So far as daily living
went, they were as near to him as the aunt who
cared for him.</p>

<p>Coming back to the library, they lingered
awhile in the reading-room, trying to realise that
it was all over, and that that little, quick tapping
would never be heard again among the books. At
last Thomas spoke:</p>

<p>"It don't seem right," he said thickly, "it don't
seem right nor fair. Here he was, doting on that
book so, tugging it round, just living on it, you
might say, and it turned on him and killed him.
Gave it up, and a sacrifice it was, too&mdash;I know&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>and
as a reward, it killed him. Went back to get
it, brought it home, took it to bed&mdash;and it killed
him. It's like those things he'd tell me out of it&mdash;they
all died; seemingly without any reason, the
gods would go back on 'em, and they'd die. He's
often read it out to me."</p>

<p>"It will be lovely to have that Children's-room
memorial," said Miss Mather, softly, "with all the
books and pictures and the little chairs. It was
beautiful in Mrs. Vanderhoof, I think. It wasn't
her fault. I wish&mdash;I wish we'd had a little chair
in there for Jimmy."</p>

<p>The librarian got up abruptly and moved
around among the magazines, a mist before her
eyes. Only now did she realise how she had grown
to love him.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>"The only objection I have to ghost stories,"
said young Sanford, "is from a literary point of
view. They're so badly done, you know."</p>

<p>"In what way?" said the clerk of the hotel, settling
back in his office chair, and smiling at young
Sanford and the circle of men who had come down
for their keys from the billiard-room.</p>

<p>"Well, in this way. I'm not considering the little
harmless stories where the heroes are only
frightened, or even those where their heads are
grey in the morning. I'm thinking of those where
they never live to tell the awful tale, you know;
the ones in which they tell their friends to come
if they call, and then they never call; the ones in
which, although they scream and scream, nobody
hears them.</p>

<p>"And yet the old trembling man who points them
to the haunted room knows perfectly well that five
men have entered that room on five nineteenths of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
October, and never come out alive. Yet he
only warns them, or at most only beseeches
them not to go in. He has no police force&mdash;not
that police could seriously harm the ghosts, but
somehow they never appear to the police; he does
not arrange with the victim's friend to burst in
the door at twelve-thirty, anyhow, whether they
are summoned or not; he doesn't&mdash;but then, what
do any of them do that they might be expected to?
And all this forced condition of things so that the
ghost may have all the evening to work quietly in.
Do you mean to tell me that if I were frightened to
the extent of grey hair in the morning, I couldn't
scream loud enough to be heard any distance?"</p>

<p>This speech drew nods of approval from several
of the men. "I've thought of that, too," said the
clerk. In a dark corner behind the stove sat a man,
hunched over his knees, silent, and apparently unknown
to any of the others. At this point he looked
up, cleared his throat, and said in a strange, husky
voice:</p>

<p>"Do you really suppose that that is anything
else than nonsense?" Young Sanford flushed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
"Sir"&mdash;he began. The other continued in his
rough, thick voice:</p>

<p>"Do you suppose they don't try to scream? Do
you suppose they don't <i>think</i> they're screaming?"</p>

<p>A little silence of discomfort fell on the circle.
There was something disagreeably suggestive in
the question. Suddenly the man spoke again.</p>

<p>"I had a friend," he said, "in fact, I had two
friends. One was young&mdash;about your age," nodding
to Sanford. "The other was older. He was not
so clever nor so attractive nor so brilliant nor so
jolly as the younger, but he had a characteristic&mdash;perhaps
his only one&mdash;for he was a very ordinary
man. He had an iron will. His determination was
as unbreakable as anything human could be. And
he was devoted to his friend, who, somehow, loved
him. I don't know why, because he had so many
other admirers&mdash;but he stuck to his friend&mdash;Joan.
They called the two Darby and Joan. Their real
names were not unlike those, and it was rather
funny. Darby used to talk as you were talking,
sir," he nodded again to Sanford, "and he was
sure, cock sure, that what he said was right. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
would tell what things were possible and what
were not, and prove what he said very nicely. Joan
wasn't clever, but he knew that it does no good
to call a thing impossible. He knew, in fact, that
nothing is more possible than the most impossible
things."</p>

<p>The man coughed and cleared his throat and
waited a moment as if to see whether he were intruding.
No one spoke, so he went on.</p>

<p>"One day Darby rushed into Joan's study and
told him of a haunted mill he'd discovered. It was
one of the old mills where the farmers used to
bring their sacks before the big concerns in the
West swallowed all the little trades. It was dusty
and cobwebbed and broken down and unused and
haunted. And there was a farmhouse directly
across the road and a house on either side of it
not a hundred feet away.</p>

<p>"'Was it always haunted?' asked Joan. 'No,'
said Darby, 'only once a year.' On Christmas eve
every year for nineteen years there had appeared,
late at night, a little light in one of the windows;
and that side of the house had an odd look, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>how
it seemed to look fresher and newer, and at
one o'clock or so a horrible piercing shriek would
ring out from the mill, and then a kind of crashing
fall, and then all was still, and the light would
disappear.</p>

<p>"'Had nobody investigated?' Oh, yes. The
first year it was noticed was when houses were
built up around it. It used to stand away from
everything else, and the miller and his family lived
there. Then, long after they were dead, people
moved out there and heard the noises and saw the
light. They thought of tramps and escaped criminals
and everything one suggests till it had occurred
too repeatedly for that, and then a young
farmer went over one Christmas eve, not telling
any one, and they found him roaming about the
mill, a hopeless wreck the next day; he had gone
quite mad.</p>

<p>"And the next year a man came up from
the city, and his friends were in the next room to
help him if he called, and he didn't call, and they
were afraid to startle him by knocking, so they
got a ladder and peeped into the window at ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
minutes to one, and he lay peacefully on the bed
with his eyes closed and his hands stretched loosely
out, and they thought it was a great joke that he
should sleep through it, so they went home, and
in the morning they found him in horrible convulsions,
and he never recovered.</p>

<p>"And there were two young divinity students
that went once together, and they had a crowd
along with instructions to break in the door at one
exactly. And at the stroke of one the crowd beat in
the great door and burst into an empty room!
They had gone up a flight too far, somehow, and
as they stood staring at each other, from the room
beneath them came a dreadful shriek and a crash,
and when they rushed down they found the boys
in a dead faint. They brought them to and got
them home, and they muttered nonsense about a
dog and a sash and would say no more. And they
escaped with severe nervous prostration. But later
they lost what little nerve they had and couldn't
sleep at night, and joined the Catholic Church, because
they said that there were things they found
it difficult to reconcile....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"'And what was the story of it all?' asked Joan.
Oh, the story was disagreeable enough. The miller's
daughter wanted to marry a poor young man,
but her father would not let her. And she refused
to accept his rich nephew. So he locked her in her
room till she should consent. And she stayed there a
week. And one night the nephew came home late
and saw a tiny light in her window, and presently
he saw some one place a ladder and go softly up,
and the miller's daughter leaned out and helped
him in. So he told her father, who came into her
room the next night with a bloodhound, and bound
her to the bed and hushed her cries with her sash,
and lit the little light. And when her lover had
climbed the ladder&mdash;the dog was there. And that
was Christmas eve.</p>

<p>"'Do the people suffer this without complaint&mdash;these
deaths and convulsions and apostasies?'
asked Joan. Well, no. But if they destroyed the
mill a liquor saloon would go up immediately. The
proprietor was simply waiting. And they didn't
want that. So they kept it quiet. And nobody need
go there. Nobody had been alarmed or hurt except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the meddlers. And in villages the people have less
scientific curiosity. But Darby was going immediately.
It was December twenty-third now. Joan
must come, too; it would be most exciting. Joan
argued against it, but he too was curious, so they
agreed to go. And the next day they went."</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>By this time the circle was absolutely silent,
concentrated to ears and eyes. They stared and
leaned towards the shadowy corner behind the stove
where the dimly defined figure crouched. The clerk
got up and turned down the gas, which flared in
his face, and the room was almost wholly dark.
The man spoke in a dull, mechanical way, as one
speaks who clears his mind, once for all. At intervals
he waited fully ten seconds to rest his voice,
strangely impressive, with its strained, choked
tones.</p>

<p>"The next day they went," he repeated. "Darby
was not only clever&mdash;he was extremely sensitive.
Ridicule was unbearable to him. And though he
was a literary fellow, and artistic and all that, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
was practical, too, for all he was so brilliant and
winning. It actually troubled him that people
should believe anything but what he called 'the
strictly logical,' and he thought Joan's ideas far
too flexible and credulous. It was really for Joan's
sake, he said in joke, whom he rather suspected of
spiritualistic leanings, that he intended to make the
excursion into the country. And he would tell nobody.
He would make no inquiries. He would conduct
the search along somewhat unusual lines, he
declared. One of them should sleep in the room.
At one o'clock precisely the other should quietly
mount a ladder fixed just where the mythical
ladder had been and enter the room in that way,
thus preventing any mischievous practical jokes
from without, and insuring help to the man within,
should he need it.</p>

<p>"And Joan agreed to this. He was interested
himself, and he'd have been as eager and scornful
as Darby if it hadn't occurred to him&mdash;for he was
a terribly literal fellow&mdash;that four tragedies, sad
as these had been, and all unexplained, couldn't
be accounted for by chance nor made less sad even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
by a good logician like Darby. So he suggested
one or two friends to fall back upon in case of
foul play of any kind. And Darby looked at him
and laughed a little sneering laugh and called
him&mdash;&mdash;" The man choked and bent lower. He
seemed to be unable to speak for some seconds.
Then he hurried on, speaking from this point very
rapidly and using a kind of clumsy gesture that
brought the scenes he spoke of strangely clear to
the men around him.</p>

<p>"He called him a coward. So Joan agreed to
go. And on the afternoon of the day before Christmas
they took a long ladder and a lantern and
some sandwiches and two revolvers and drove in
a butcher's cart to the little village. And Joan was
as eager as Darby that no one should know. You
see, Darby called him a coward.</p>

<p>"They slipped into the old, dingy mill at dusk,
and went over it with the greatest thoroughness.
Everything was open and empty. Only the corner
bedroom and one of the living rooms were furnished
at all. The dust lay thick in the mill
proper, but the living rooms were singularly free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
from it. Darby noticed this and remarked it to
Joan. 'It doesn't smell half so musty, either,'
he said. 'I'm glad of that. I hate old, musty
smells.'</p>

<p>"Then a queer, crawly feeling came over Joan,
and he said: 'Darby, let's go home. Life's short
enough, heaven knows. If anything&mdash;&mdash;' And
then Darby told him once for all that if he wanted
to go home he might, and otherwise he might
shut up.</p>

<p>"'Do you want it dusty and smelly?' said he.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said Joan, 'I do. I don't see why it isn't,
either. It's just as old and just as deserted as the
other part.'</p>

<p>"'You might get a little dust from the other
side and scatter it about,' said Darby, and
before Joan could reply he had scooped a handful
of dry, brown dust from the bagroom of the mill
and laid it about on the bureau and chairs of the
bedroom. 'Now come out for our last patrol,' he
said. They went out and studied the mill carefully.
As they came around to the house side, keeping
carefully in the shadow, Joan looked surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and pointed to the door by which they had entered.</p>

<p>"'That door's shut,' he said.</p>

<p>"'Well?' asked Darby.</p>

<p>"'We left it ajar.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, the wind!' said Darby, and went up to
the door softly, listening for any escaping joker.
He rattled the knob and pushed it inward, but the
door did not yield. 'Why, you couldn't have left it
ajar,' he said, 'it's locked!'</p>

<p>"Joan stared at the house, wondering if it was
possible that the window-panes really shone so
brightly. And the cobwebs about the blinds, where
were they? He could have sworn that the porch
was full of dead leaves and sticks when they went
in&mdash;it was as clean as his hand now.</p>

<p>"'We'll go in by the window, the broken one, at
the back,' he said quietly. They went around the
house and hunted for the broken window, but did
not find it. The window was not only whole but
locked. Then Joan set his teeth.</p>

<p>"'The broken window must have been at the mill
side,' he said, 'we'll go there.' So they went around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
and clambered in by a paneless window and went to
the bedroom. The room was dim, but they could
distinguish objects fairly well. Darby looked
queerly at Joan.</p>

<p>"'So you cleared away the dust,' he asked.</p>

<p>"'What dust?' asked Joan. Then he followed
Darby's eyes, and where the little piles of brown
dust had lain were only clean, bare boards.</p>

<p>"Outside, the teams of the home-coming farmers
rolled by. A dog barked, and now a child called.
But they seemed far away&mdash;in another country.
Where the two young fellows stood, there was a
strange lonely belt of silence.</p>

<p>"'Perhaps I brushed the chair as we went out,'
said Darby slowly. But he looked at Joan queerly.</p>

<p>"They took their supper, and then Joan announced
his intention of staying in the room while
Darby patrolled the house, and climbed the ladder
at one. At first Darby demurred. He had planned
to stay. But Joan was inflexible. It was utterly
useless to argue with him, so Darby agreed. If
Joan wanted help he was to call. At eleven and
twelve Darby was to climb the ladder and look in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and at one he was to come in, whatever the situation.
At the slightest intimation of danger of any
kind Joan was to fire his revolver and Darby was
to call for help and rush up the ladder. For all
that the people were so quiet round about, they
were probably uneasy&mdash;they knew that things
might happen on the night before Christmas.</p>

<p>"Joan sat for some time after Darby had left
him, staring about the room. It was simply furnished
with a large bed, a table, and two deal
chairs. Thrown over the bed was a moth-eaten
blanket, checked white and red. Joan swept it off
from the bed and shook it, closing his eyes instinctively
to avoid the dust. But no dust came.
He shook it again. It was as fresh and clean as
his handkerchief. He threw it back on the bed and
looked out at Darby walking quietly around in the
shadow.</p>

<p>"He was glad Darby was out there. He got to
thinking of ghosts and strange preparations for
their coming. The boards of the window creaked,
and he gasped and stared, only to see Darby's
face at the window. 'Anything happened?' he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
signalled. Joan shook his head. It must be
eleven o'clock. How was it possible? The time
had seemed so short. He stared at a big star till
his eyes swam. He felt dull and drowsy. He had
sat up late the night before, and he needed sleep.</p>

<p>"A thought came to him, and it seemed somehow
very original and striking. He tapped on the
pane to Darby.</p>

<p>"'I'll lie down and take a little nap,' he whispered,
opening the window softly. 'You can call
me at twelve.' Darby nodded.</p>

<p>"'How do you feel, old fellow? All right?' he
asked."</p>

<p>The man choked again and was silent for a time.
The strain was growing. The men waited for something
to happen as one awaits the falling of the
red, snapping embers.</p>

<p>"Joan lay down in that bed," said the stranger
hoarsely, and from this point he hurried on almost
too quickly for clearness, "on that hideous checked
blanket, and fell asleep. He fell asleep thinking
of Darby's words and how thoughtful they were:
'How do you feel, old fellow? All right?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"He had bad dreams. He dreamed a woman
stood at the foot of the bed and stared at him
and motioned him to go. And she was an unnatural
woman. She kept changing colour, from red to yellow,
from yellow to cream colour, from cream
colour to white, from white to&mdash;ah! she was a dead
woman!</p>

<p>"She motioned him to go, but he refused. She
came to the side of the bed and took off her long
red sash and bound him down. Then he was willing
to go indeed, and strained his muscles in useless
efforts to break away, but she laughed at him
and then breathed in his face till her damp, icy
breath chilled his very soul&mdash;and he woke, covered
with the sweat of terror&mdash;to see her standing at the
foot of the bed, looking, looking into his staring
eyes!</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>"So it was true. There were such things. But
at least his limbs were free, and to his joy he discovered
that he was not afraid. No; he had a dull
feeling of coming disaster, but no fear. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
a young woman, with big shadowy eyes and a
strange mouth. She had on a long, loose white
nightgown, open at the throat, and she carried
a little lamp. 'Go!' he saw in her eyes as plainly
as if she said it. He looked about the room&mdash;he
could have sworn it was changed. It had the air
of a woman's room, that she is living in and keeps
her things in. He had no right there&mdash;none. He
should have gone. But he was proud because he
wasn't afraid, and he answered her with his eyes
that he would not go. A tired, puzzled look came
into her face, a kind of frown, and she leaned
over the footboard and begged him with those big
dark eyes, begged him hard to go. He had his
chance&mdash;oh, yes, the fool had his chance!</p>

<p>"But he was so proud that he could master her,
master a returned soul&mdash;for lovely as she was, he
knew she wasn't human&mdash;that he only set his teeth
and started up to come nearer her. But she raised
her hand and he fell back, feeling queer and
drowsy. Then she came to the edge of the bed and
sat down and took from behind her a soft red silk
sash and drew it across his face. A sweet, languid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
feeling stole over him; the bed seemed like a cloud
of down, her sash smelled like spice and sandalwood
in a warm wind. He felt he was being drugged and
weakened, and he tried to stumble up, but the soft
silk smothered him, and he became almost unconscious.</p>

<p>"He only wanted one thing&mdash;to feel her fingers
touch his face and to hold her long brown hair. And
while she drew the sash across his mouth he
stretched out his hands on either side to catch it and
reach her fingers. There was nothing ghostly about
her&mdash;she was only a lovely dream-woman. Maybe
he was asleep....</p>

<p>"And then she pulled the sash away, and he
caught her eye and awoke with a start&mdash;her look
was full of triumph. She didn't beg him any longer.
This was no helpless, gentle spirit of a woman;
this was a weird elemental creature; she hadn't any
soul or any pity; something made her act out all
this dreadful tragedy, without any regard for human
life or reason. He knew somehow that she
couldn't help his weakness; that though in some
fiendish way she had bound him hand and foot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
she did it not of herself, but in obedience to some
awful law that she couldn't help any more than
he. And then he began to be afraid. Slowly great
waves of horror rose and grew and broke over him.
He tried to move his feet and hands, but he could
not so much as will the muscles to contract. He
strained till the drops stood on his forehead, but
still his arms lay stretched motionless across the
bed.</p>

<p>"Just then he met her eyes again, and his heart
sank, they were so mocking and bitter. 'Fool!
fool!' they said. They were so malignant, and yet
so impersonal&mdash;he could have sworn that she was
afraid too. What was to happen? Would she kill
him? His tongue was helpless. He worked his lips
weakly, but they made no words. And she turned
down her mouth scornfully and played with the
sash. Why did she wait? For she was waiting for
a time to come&mdash;her eyes told that. What was that
time? A great joy that Darby was safe outdoors
came to him, and he remembered that Darby would
come at twelve! He would break the spell. And just
then she left the bed and bent down over the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
lamp, and when she took it up it was lighted. She
moved across to the window and set it in the sill.
Then she glided to the door and locked it. Joan
heard the bolt slip.</p>

<p>"Steps sounded on the ladder outside. Into
Joan's half-dulled thought came a kind of comfort.
Darby was coming. Some one knocked on the
pane and the window was raised from the outside.</p>

<p>"'Joan! Joan!' whispered Darby, 'are you all
right? Why did you light the lamp? Where are
you?' And then Joan, the fool, forgot that if he
had not answered, Darby would surely have come
in. It seemed to him that if he did not speak now,
he was lost. He strained his throat to say four
words&mdash;only four: 'All right. Come in.' Just that.
The first two to reassure Darby, the second to bring
him. He made a mighty effort. 'All&mdash;all right!'
he shouted, 'c&mdash;c&mdash;,' and then her eyes were on
him and he faded into unconsciousness. He saw in
them a terror and surprise. He understood that
she wondered at his speaking. There was a stinging
pain in his throat, and he heard Darby whisper
angrily,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Keep still, can't you? Don't howl so! It's
quarter to one. I looked in at twelve, and didn't
want to wake you. You'd better get up now&mdash;who's
that down there?' and with a sickening despair
he heard Darby hurry down the ladder.</p>

<p>"The leaves rustled a little and then all was
still. He didn't struggle any longer. It was clear to
him now. He was to play the lover in this ill-fated
tragedy, whose actors offered themselves, fools that
they were, unasked, each time. And what happened
to the lover? Why, he was killed. Well, rather that
he should die than Darby. It seemed to him so
reasonable, now. No one had asked him to suffer.
He had had his chance to go and refused it. No
one could help him now. Not even she. They must
play it out, puppets of an inexorable drama.</p>

<p>"And then the girl dashed to the bed, and sank
beside it as if to pray. And he felt her hair on his
face, as he had hoped, but it brought no joy to
him. For something was coming up from the floor
below. Something that sent a thrill before it, that
advanced, slowly, slowly, surely. The girl shuddered
and grasped the bed and tried to pull her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>self
up, but she sank helplessly back. And slowly
the bolt of the door pushed back. No one pushed it,
but it slipped back. Then slowly, inch by inch,
the door opened. Joan grew stiff and cold, and
would not have looked but that his eyes were
fixed. Wider, wider, till it stood flat against the
wall.</p>

<p>"Then up the stairs came steps. And with them
others, quick and pattering. What was that? Who
walked so quickly, with padding, thudding feet?
He longed for them to come in&mdash;he dreaded their
coming. The door was ready for them. The room
was swept and clean.</p>

<p>"Up, up, they came, the heavy steps and the
scratching, pattering feet. Nearer, nearer&mdash;they
came in. The man, large, dark, heavy-jawed; the
stone-grey, snarling hound, licking its frothing
jaws, straining at its chain. The girl writhed
against the bed in terror&mdash;she opened her lips,
but with a stride the man was upon her,
his heavy hand was over her mouth. He dragged
her up, shaking and sinking, he snatched the sash
and bound her mouth, he held her at arm's length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and stared once in her eyes. Scorn and rage and
murder were in his.</p>

<p>"Joan forgot his own danger in terrified pity.
He struggled a moment, but it was useless. His
dreadful bonds still held. The man came to the bed,
dragging the hound, and Joan shut his eyes, not
to see the dark evil face. He would die in the dark,
alone, unaided. Oh! to call once! To hear a human
voice! But there was no sound but the panting
of the great, eager dog.</p>

<p>"The man seemed not to see him. He seized the
girl, and turning her toward the light that burned
at the pane, he bound her to the bed-post with the
silken sash. She writhed and bent and tried to
grasp his feet; she pleaded with her eyes till their
agony cut Joan like a knife, but the man tied her
straight and fast. Then he walked to the pane
and crouched down by it and held the dog's muzzle,
and became like a stone image.</p>

<p>"And suddenly it flashed across Joan's mind,
with a passion of fear to which all that had gone
before was as nothing, that Darby was coming up
that ladder to that light! Darby, whom he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
thought so safe, was to come unknowing, unwarned,
to that straining, panting beast. He
turned faint for a moment. And then with all the
power of his soul he tried to scream. He felt his
throat strain and bend and all but burst with the
tremendous effort. He tried again, and the pain
blinded him. At his feet there the girl strained and
twisted, great tears rolling down her cheeks. And
yet there was a ghastly silence. The stifled panting
of that hound echoed in a deadly quiet. It
was horrible, pitiful! The girl's white gown was
torn and mussed; her soft naked shoulder quivered
when she strained against the cruel sash.
He could see that her arm was red where it was
tied.</p>

<p>"She trembled and bent and bit her lip till the
blood stained her chin. He cursed and prayed and
shrieked till the sound, had it come, would have
deafened him&mdash;but it was all a ghastly mockery!
It was as still as a quiet summer afternoon&mdash;and
the dog and the man waited at the window.</p>

<p>"There was a sound of scraping. Someone was
coming up the ladder&mdash;someone who whistled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
softly under his breath, and came nearer every
moment. Up, up&mdash;the ladder rattled against the
window-frame. The man at the window slipped his
hand slowly, slowly from the dog's muzzle. The
dog stiffened and drew back his black, dripping
jaws from his yellow teeth. The man's fingers sunk
in the beast's wrinkled neck and he held him back,
while he threw one look of hate and triumph at
the tortured woman behind him.</p>

<p>"The man bound to the bed couldn't bear it any
longer. As a hand grasped the window-sill from
outside, he summoned all his iron will, and with a
rasping, rending effort that brought a sickly,
warm taste to his mouth, he gave a hoarse cry.</p>

<p>"Then the woman leaned over till the sash sunk
into her soft flesh, and shrieked with a high, shrill
note that cut the air like a knife. But even as she
shrieked, a form rose over the sill, there was a
rush from inside, and their voices were drowned
in a cry of terror, a scream so broken and despairing
that Joan could not recognise the voice. And
then there was a horrid crashing fall, and the light
went out, and something snapped in the brain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the man chained to the bed, and he dropped for
miles into a deep, black gulf."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was a dead silence in the room. No one
dared to speak. The stranger's voice had quavered
and broken, and in a hoarse whisper he said, rising
and stumbling to the door while they made
way for him silently:</p>

<p>"And when he knew his friends again, Darby
had been buried a long time. Joan did not know
whether a broken neck is so much worse than anything
else in the world. He hadn't any curiosity
about the mill&mdash;he didn't care to hear the details
of how they burned it to the ground. Perhaps
after a while he will be too tired to contradict ignorant
people. But he thinks&mdash;he has said, that
when a man has not slept five hours in a week, nor
spoken for days together without agony, much
may be forgiven him in the line of intolerance
of other people's ignorance&mdash;a blessed ignorance
gentlemen, a blessed ignorance."</p>

<p>The door closed behind him and the men drew
a long breath. No one turned out the gas and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
burned till morning, for they took their keys in
silence and went upstairs, for the most part arm
in arm, haunted by the hoarse, rough voice of the
stranger, whom they never saw again.</p>

<p>And indeed they did not care to see him. "For
what could one say?" as young Sanford demanded,
the next day. "It either happened, or it didn't. If
it didn't, he can say no more; if it did, then he
is right, and we are in blessed ignorance." And
no one of the circle but nodded and looked for a
moment at the chair behind the stove.</p>

<h2 id="THE_TWILIGHT_GUESTS">THE TWILIGHT GUESTS</h2></div>


<p>When they left him, in the warm, late afternoon,
lying listless on his couch in the porch, they
thought he would stay alone there till they
came again. His little granddaughter, indeed, felt
so sad at deserting him that she ran back and
kissed him twice. "To leave Grandpapa alone!"
she said. But he was not alone; there came to him
strange guests and sweet. And this was the manner
of their coming.</p>

<p>As he watched the shadow creeping up the steps,
he thought how often he had marked the time by
it in the far away days. He remembered how he
had tried to keep in the broad sunbeam that lay
along the walk, when he used to run home to supper
tired and hungry, shouting to his mother that
his school was over and out and that he had come&mdash;"So
hungry, mother dear!" And as he thought
of her, slow tears crept from under his old eyelids,
and he raised his hand feebly to wipe them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
away. When he saw clearly again, he started
slightly, for up the path, walking in the sunbeam,
came a boy. He smiled sweetly, cheerily at the old
man, and sat down confidingly, close to the couch.
"It is so warm in the sun!" he said.</p>

<p>The old man turned uneasily and looked at him.
"Are you Arthur's son?" he asked doubtfully.
"My eyes are so dim&mdash;I cannot always tell you
apart, at first. Are you Arthur's son?"</p>

<p>"No," said the child.</p>

<p>"Are you&mdash;&mdash;" but then the boy looked full in
his face and the old man could not take his eyes
from that searching smile. And as he looked, there
grew around his heart the sweet faint breath of
lilac trees, though it was early autumn and not at
all the spring. And deep in the child's eyes was
so strange a soul&mdash;yet so familiar! As he looked
yet deeper the lilac scent grew stronger and he
dared not turn away his eyes, lest he should lose
it. So he listened to the child, who spoke brightly
yet gravely, with his head resting against the old
man's knee.</p>

<p>"See!" he said, "the lilacs are all out! I took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
a bunch to school, and the teacher wore them in
her dress. Oh, but I grow tired of the school in
the mornings, when the birds sing under the window!
The brook is all full with the flood water,
do you know?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old man dreamily, "yes, I
know."</p>

<p>"There are pickerel there&mdash;I saw one, anyway!"
said the boy. "The old one&mdash;he lives under the
stone all alone. If I could get him, I'd be proud
enough! But I never can&mdash;I can only catch him
on a Friday night when the moon is full, and then
I'm not allowed out! The man that weeds the garden
told me that. Do you remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember," said the old man.</p>

<p>"But if I don't fish, I don't care so much," said
the boy happily. "For I get so wet and dirty, and
Rachel doesn't like me then. I can't look on her
book. She is so dear! She never spots the ink on
her apron, like the other girls. And she never eats
fish, either. She thinks it hurts them too much to
kill them. I don't think so&mdash;do you? But girls are
different."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where are you going to-night?" said the old
man, quietly, yet his voice trembled.</p>

<p>"I'm going to sing to Rachel's grandfather.
He's blind, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old man, "and old. His hair is
white. He walks with a cane. But he loves the singing."</p>

<p>"Then to-morrow I must go to church," said
the boy. "The minister talks and prays and I get
so sleepy. But mother keeps a peppermint for me,
just before the second hymn. Then I have it for
the long prayer. And I can sing the hymns.
Rachel never looks at me, she sits so still in church.
And she won't play on Sunday. I can have my
whip and two of the largest marbles. Do you think
that is wrong?"</p>

<p>"No," said the old man, "I don't think that is
wrong."</p>

<p>"And we have gingerbread on the porch in the
afternoon," said the boy, "and Rachel comes.
Mother says children must not be vexed at the
Lord's Day."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old man, "mother is so good to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
us&mdash;so good&mdash;&mdash;" and when he saw clearly again,
the child was gone. Only the shadow lay upon the
upper step of the porch, and the sunbeam was
shrunken to a narrow path of light.</p>

<p>He stretched out his trembling hands and called
sorrowfully to the boy. "Come back! O come back!
I had forgotten so much! And the lilacs&mdash;&mdash;" but
he was alone. And his hair was almost white. He
covered his face with his hands and shivered. For
the shadow was creeping up the porch.</p>

<p>And then over his chilled heart there came the
breath of roses&mdash;summer roses. The air struck
warm and soft upon his cheeks. And when he
dropped his hands there stood in the sun-ray a
straight tall youth. His eyes were shining with
strength; his smile was happiness itself. In his firm
brown hands he held roses&mdash;summer roses. The
old man forgot to be afraid and raised himself
on the cushions.</p>

<p>"Give them to me&mdash;give them!" he cried. The
young man laughed low and laid the red flowers
softly up against the withered cheeks. Then he sat
down and took the cold, dry hands in his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do they make you remember?" he said.</p>

<p>The old man sighed for pure joy. "Ah, how
sweet&mdash;how heavenly sweet! Did they come from
the garden behind her father's house?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the youth, "from the old bush near
the wall. It was moonlight, and we picked them
together. I reached the highest ones, because
Rachel is not tall. She wore&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She wore the white gown with the big shade
hat," said the old man eagerly. "And I made a
wreath for her shoulders. I called her&mdash;what did
I call her? The queen&mdash;the queen"&mdash;</p>

<p>"The queen of roses," said the youth.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, the queen of roses!" said the old man.
"Her mouth was like the pink, young buds. We
went up and down the long paths, and I wanted
her to take my arm."</p>

<p>"But she would not," laughed the young man.
"She said that old folks might lean, but she could
run as well as any man!"</p>

<p>"So she ran through the garden, and I after!"
cried the old man, crushing the roses till they
filled the porch with sweetness. "She hid behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the old elm and let me call and call. And I had to
find her in the moonshadows. You know she grew
afraid and cried out when I caught her? And yet
she knew I would. But women are so. Her mother
knew I was with her, so she let us stay till it was
late. Rachel's mother was kind to me, you
know?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the young man. "But she knew that
Rachel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the old man quickly, "it seems they
all knew! All but Rachel and me! Now that is so
strange. For we should have known it first. But
Rachel laughed so when I tried to tell her, she
said&mdash;what was it she said?"</p>

<p>"That you were too young to know how you
would think of it later," said the youth.</p>

<p>"And I said, 'I'm old enough to know I love
you, Rachel, now and for ever!'" said the old man
softly, clasping his hands together so that the
roses dropped to the ground. "And then she did
not laugh at all, but only held her head down so
I could not see her eyes, and would not speak."</p>

<p>"It was so still," said the youth. "There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
no breeze, and everything in the garden listened,
listened, for what she would say."</p>

<p>"But nothing in the garden could hear," said
the old man eagerly, "because she only whispered!"</p>

<p>"Was it then that her mother called?" asked the
youth.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old man, and he smiled. "But
we did not come, for Rachel was afraid to go.
She thought her mother would not like to have
her leave the old home. And she feared to tell her
that she wanted to go. So we sat like silly children
in the dark. You see, I was afraid, too. Her
father and mother were old, and old people cannot
know how we feel when love first comes to us&mdash;and
yet they loved, once!"</p>

<p>"Yes, they loved once," said the youth, "but
they forget. They think of lands and money and
the most prudent course&mdash;they cannot feel their
heart's blood rushing through their veins, surging
in their ears, 'She loves me!' They cannot feel that
one hour with her is dearer than years with the
others of the world!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"And then we went in!" said the old man softly.
"Then we went in! And her mother stood waiting
for us. Rachel would not look up and I had to
lead her by the hand. She feared that we could
not make it plain, that her mother would scold
us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The youth laughed aloud. "But did she?" he
said.</p>

<p>And the old man laughed too.</p>

<p>"No. She came to me and kissed me and then
she held Rachel and cried. But not that she was
sorry. Older people feel strange when the younger
ones start away, you see."</p>

<p>The young man picked up the roses and laid
them again by the side of the couch. "Sleep," he
said softly, "and dream of her!" And the old man's
eyelids drooped and the hands that held the roses
relaxed in quiet sleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke the sun had almost set. The
path of rays had faded and the creeping shadow
had covered the highest step and lay along the
porch. He felt feebly for the roses, but they were
gone. And the sweet warm scent of them was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
in his dim memory. But there sat in the shadow a
man.</p>

<p>Threads of grey were in his hair and lines
around his firm mouth. But in his eyes shone yet
a sweet strength, and he held his head high as he
spoke.</p>

<p>"Do you know where I have been?" he said.</p>

<p>The old man shook his head.</p>

<p>"Think!" said the other.</p>

<p>Then while he looked into the stranger's eyes,
there stole across his heart the wind that blows
through the orchard when the fruit is ripe. He
drew in great breaths of it, in doubt, and at last
he said in a whisper so low that he hardly heard
himself, "You have been to his grave&mdash;his little
grave!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the man, "I have. His mother goes
there alone&mdash;not even I go with her. She goes
alone."</p>

<p>"No," said the old man solemnly, "no. God
goes with her. I thought that she would have died&mdash;why
did she live?"</p>

<p>"Because," said the other, "because you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
have been alone. And you could not have kept
yourself a man, if she had gone, too."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" said the old man softly, "that is it.
She is an angel! When he was born I was almost
afraid. I said, 'My son! I have a son! If I should
die to-night, he would live and I should live in
him!' And when she brought him herself into the
orchard&mdash;I see her now&mdash;I see her now!"</p>

<p>He could not lift his head from the pillow, he
was so tired and weak, but with his eyes he begged
the other to come nearer. The man came close to
the couch and looked down tenderly at the old
man. "She wore the white trailing gown," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," whispered the old man, "and the great
wide hat. And she held him up under the brim
and said that if it should rain, she and he could
keep dry together, but I must stay in the rain!"</p>

<p>"Do you remember," said the other, "how when
he could just say words, you played with him under
the apple tree?"</p>

<p>"Can I ever forget?" said the old man. "But
now the angels teach him a better language, so
that he had but one to learn!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you remember how she left him with her
mother and went away with you?" said the other.</p>

<p>The old man smiled a little. "Ah, yes! Well
enough!" he said. "We thought we would be young
again, and leave him to his grandmother and his
sisters. He had enough care! It was not lack of
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And when you had gone only a few miles she
grew anxious&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" said the old man. "She said, 'Suppose
he is sick? Suppose he falls into the brook?
He walks about so brave and strong&mdash;and he is
our only son!' So we came back."</p>

<p>"You were good to her," said the other. "You
did always just as she wished."</p>

<p>"I loved her," said the old man simply.</p>

<p>The stranger's eyes grew moist and his voice
shook as he said, "When he grew sick&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, when he grew sick!" cried the old man
bitterly. "Almost I lost my trust in the Giver of
my child, and dared not give him back! How I
begged! How I prayed!&mdash;you know!"</p>

<p>"Yes," whispered the stranger, "I know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then she left me for the first time," said the
old man slowly. "For the first time. She went alone
and prayed. Oh Rachel, my dear, dear wife, I
could not go with you to God! I think even we
go best alone! I said 'It cannot be! He cannot let
it come! I have done all my life as best I knew
how, and is this my reward?' And I heard her
crying, and I wished I had never lived."</p>

<p>"But not for long?" said the other.</p>

<p>The old man smiled through his tears.</p>

<p>"No, no, not for long!" he said. "When Rachel
saw that I was weak she grew strong. It is strange,
but women are the strongest then. And she showed
me the folly and wickedness of throwing away my
faith because the Most Faithful had taken away
my child. And she brought me my little daughters
and set them on my knees and put her arms around
my neck. So I grew comforted. And there have
come other sons&mdash;Arthur and John. But he&mdash;ah,
Rachel! Little we thought when we laid him on
the grass under the tree and measured him with
goldenrod, that he would so soon lie there for all
our lives!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"And he lies there now," said the stranger.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old man softly, "he lies there
now. Under the apple tree where he lay and
laughed that day, he lies there now. For Rachel
wanted it so. 'I carried him out there the first
time,' she said, 'and he always loved it there. I
used to walk there before he came, and plan for
him, how he should grow so great and famous and
good; and now I want him to be there, while he
is asleep. And I think that all the fields are God's&mdash;the
orchard as well as the graveyard.' So we
laid him there, and she goes there often, and I."</p>

<p>"You miss her?" said the stranger.</p>

<p>"Miss her?" said the old man, staring at
the visitor, "miss her? Why, she is here! She is
my wife!&mdash;--" but he was alone, on the couch,
with the faint breath of ripening apples dying
on the air.</p>

<p>And as he turned wearily, the shadow crept
softly and covered the porch and the couch where
he lay. The sun dropped behind the hills and the
air struck cold on his uncovered shoulders. He was
too tired to cry, too old and weak to question or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
find fault, but he dimly felt that to be left alone
was hard. His memory grew suddenly untrustworthy;
had they come or not? It was all so plain
to him now. He was not with Rachel, he was
neither in the church nor in the garden nor in the
orchard. He was an old man, strangely weak and
confused, left alone.</p>

<p>"Ah, Rachel," he murmured, "only come again,
while I go! Come to take me&mdash;not that it will be
long to wait before I see you, dear! We have been
so happy, you and I! But it was so cold&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then while he shivered helplessly and half
afraid, there came the scent of spring lilac-bushes,
and by his bed stood the bright-eyed child.</p>

<p>"Come! come and sit by me!" cried the old man.
But the boy only smiled. "Take my hands&mdash;they
are so cold!" he begged. Still the boy smiled. And
as the old man looked, the child's eyes filled him
with half hope, half fear. "Are you&mdash;are you&mdash;&mdash;"
he tried to speak, but no sound came from his lips.</p>

<p>"If I come and touch you," said the boy, "it
will be the end. Shall I come?" The old man's face
lighted softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," he said in his heart, for he could not
speak aloud, "yes, come now!" The boy laughed
and stepped to the couch and lay down beside him,
putting his cheek close to the white hair.</p>

<p>Into the heart of the old man rushed a quick,
new life. "Ah, Rachel, Rachel," he said strong and
clear, "sit on the step and eat your cake with me?
Here is the flag-root I promised you&mdash;it's quite
clean. I took off all the mud! And here is the red
marble"&mdash;but the child kissed him and he went to
sleep, holding to his heart his happy youth.</p>

<p>And when they found him in the evening, they
were not too grieved, for on his face was a great

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
