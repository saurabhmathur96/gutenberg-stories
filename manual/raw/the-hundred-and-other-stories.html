<p>Mrs. Darling was dining from home,
and every heart in her little establishment
rejoiced over the circumstance, for it meant
less work for everybody, with an opportunity
to enjoy Christmas Eve on his own account.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonnet, the lady's-maid, with the
plans she had in mind for the evening, was
scarcely annoyed at all when her mistress
scolded because the corset-lace had got itself
in a knot.</p>

<p>The chamber was full of a delicate odor of
iris. The gas-globes at the ends of their
jointed gold arms looked like splendid yellow
pearls; on the dressing-table under them
glittered a quantity of highly embossed silverware,
out of all reasonable proportion with
the little person owning it, who sat before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the mirror beautifying her finger-nails while
Mrs. Bonnet did her hair.</p>

<p>"Mind what you are about," the mistress
murmured, diligently polishing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonnet instantly removed the hot
tongs from the tress she was twisting, and
caught it again with greater precaution.</p>

<p>"Mind what you are about," warned Mrs.
Darling, somewhat louder, a beginning of
acid in her voice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonnet again disengaged the hair
from the tongs, and after a little pause, during
which to make firm her nerve, with infinite
solicitude took hold again of the golden
strand, and would have waved it, but&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mind what you are about!" almost
screamed little Mrs. Darling. "Didn't I <i>tell</i>
you to be careful? You have been pulling
right along at the same hair! <i>Do</i> consider
that it is a human scalp, and not a <i>wig</i> you
are dealing with! Bonny, you are not a bad
woman, but you will wear me out. Come,
go on with it; it is getting late."</p>

<p>Before the hair-dressing was accomplished
Mrs. Darling rolled up her eyes&mdash;her blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
eyes, round and angelic as they could sometimes
be&mdash;at the reflection of Mrs. Bonnet's
face in the mirror, and said, meekly: "Bonny,
do you think that black moir of mine
would make over nicely for you? I am going
to give it to you. No, don't thank me&mdash;it
makes me look old. Now my slippers."</p>

<p>While Bonnet was forcing the shoe on her
fat little foot, Mrs. Darling's glance rested,
perhaps by chance, on a photograph that
leaned against the clock over the mantelpiece.
It was that of a still young, well-looking
man, whose face wore an unmistakable
look of goodness, of the kind that
made it what one expected to read under it
in print&mdash;the Rev. Dorel Goodhue. There
was another more conspicuous man-photograph
in the room, on the dressing-table, in
a massive frame that matched the toilet accessories.
It stood there always, airing a
photographic smile among the brushes and
hand-glasses and pin-boxes.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Mrs. Darling, while she
braced herself against Bonnet to help get
the small shoe on&mdash;"I suppose I have a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
bad temper!" and she laughed in such a sensible,
natural, good-natured way any one
must have felt that her exhibition of a moment
before had been a sort of joke. "Tell
the truth, Bonny: if every mistress had to
have a certificate from her maid, you would
give me a pretty bad one, wouldn't you?
But I was abominably brought up. I used
to slap my governesses. And I have had
all sorts of illnesses; trouble, too. And I
mostly don't mean anything by it. It is just
nerves. Poor Bonny! I treat you shamefully,
don't I?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ma'am," said the lady's-maid, expanding
in the light of this uncommon familiarity,
"I would give you a character as
would make it no difficulty in you getting a
first-class situation right away; you may depend
upon it, ma'am, I would. Don't this
shoe seem a bit tight, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. It is a whole size larger than
I wear. If you would just be so good as
to hold the shoe-horn properly. There, that
is it."</p>

<p>She stood before the bed, on which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
spread two long evening dresses. A little
King Charles spaniel had made himself comfortable
in the softest of one. His mistress
pounced on him with a cry, first cuffed, then
kissed and put him down. "Which shall I
wear?" she asked.</p>

<p>Bonnet drew back for a critical view, but
dared not suggest unprompted.</p>

<p>"The black and white is more becoming,
but the violet crape is prettier. Oh, Bonny,
decide quickly for me, like a tossed-up penny!"</p>

<p>"Well, I think now I should say the violet,
ma'am."</p>

<p>"Should you?" Mrs. Darling mused, with
a finger against her lip. "But I look less
well in it. Surely I had rather look pretty
myself than have my dress look pretty,
hadn't I? Give me the black and white,
and hurry. Mr. Goodhue will be here in a
second. Bonnet!" she burst forth, in quite
another tone. "You trying creature! Didn't
I <i>tell</i> you to put a draw-string through that
lace? Didn't I <i>tell</i> you? <i>Where</i> are your
ears? <i>Where</i> are your senses? What on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
<i>earth</i> do you spend your time thinking
about, I should like to know, anyway? I
wouldn't wear that thing as it <i>is</i>, not for&mdash;not
for&mdash;Oh, I am tired of living surrounded
by fools! Take it away&mdash;take it
away! Bring the violet!"</p>

<p>At last she was encased in the fluffy violet
crape, and at sight of the sweet picture she
made in the mirror her brow cleared a little;
she looked baby-eyed and angelic again, with
her wavy hair meekly parted in the middle.
While she looked at herself she let Bonnet
have one of her arms to button the long
glove.</p>

<p>"Ouch! Go softly; you pinch!" she murmured.</p>

<p>Bonnet changed her method with the silver
hook, adjusted it anew, and pulled at it
ever so softly.</p>

<p>"Ouch! You pinch me!" said Mrs. Darling,
a little louder.</p>

<p>Bonnet stopped short, and looked helplessly
at the glove, that could not be made
to meet without strain over the plump
white wrist. After a breathing-while, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
stealthy gentleness, again she fitted the silver
loop over the button, and, with a devout
inward appeal to Heaven, tried to induce it
through the button-hole. She had almost
succeeded when Mrs. Darling screamed,
"Ouch, ouch, ouch! You pinch like <i>anything</i>!
I am black and blue!" And tearing
her arm from the quaking servant, began
fidgeting with the button herself, soon pulling
it off.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>"SHE LET BONNET HAVE ONE OF HER ARMS"</p>
</div></div>


<p class="p2">"Bonnet, how many times must I tell you
to sew the buttons fast on my gloves before
you give them me to put on?" she asked,
severely. "No, they were not!" she stormed,
and peeled off the glove, throwing it far
from her, inside out.</p>

<p>There was a knock, and a respectful voice
saying, outside the door, "Mr. Goodhue is
below, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Get a needle," Mrs. Darling said, humbly,
like a child reminded of its promise to
behave, and waited patiently while the button
was sewed on, and held out her arm
again, letting Bonnet pinch without a murmur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
A final bunch of violets was tucked in the
bosom of her gown, and she was leaving the
bedroom, when, as if at a sudden thought,
she turned back, went to the door of a little
room leading from it, and stood looking in.</p>

<p>"Aren't they lovely, the hundred of them?"
she gushed. "Did you ever see such a sight?
One prettier than the other! I almost wish
I were one of the little girls myself!"</p>

<p>"Them that gets them will be made happy,
sure, ma'am. I suppose it's for some
Christmas-tree?"</p>

<p>"They are for my cousin Dorel's orphans.
Pick up, Bonny. Open the windows. Mind
you keep Jetty with you. Don't let him go
into the kitchen. I am sure they feed him. I
shall not be very late&mdash;not later than twelve."</p>

<p>Mrs. Darling went down the stairs, followed
by Bonnet with her mantle and fan,
and Jetty, who leaped and yapped in the delusion
that he was going to be taken for a
walk.</p>

<p>The gentleman waiting below came forward
to take Mrs. Darling's hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonnet listened to the exchange of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
polite expressions between them with no
small degree of impatience; it seemed to
her they might just as well have made these
communications later, in the carriage.</p>

<p>At last and at last they were gone.
With the clap of the door behind them the
whole atmosphere of the house changed as
by enchantment. A door slammed somewhere;
a voice burst out singing below-stairs;
the man in livery who had held the
door for Mrs. Darling and her reverend cousin
leaned over the banisters and shouted, heartily,
"Catherine! I say, Catherine!" Mrs.
Bonnet fairly scampered up-stairs, with the
mistaken Jetty, who thought this was the
beginning of a romp, hard after her, trying
to catch her by the heels.</p>

<p>She entered Mrs. Darling's room with no
affectation of soft-stepping, threw up the
window&mdash;the sharp outer air cut into the
scented warmth like a silver axe&mdash;and began
pushing things briskly into their places. She
digressed from her labors a moment to get
from the closet a black moir, which she examined,
then replaced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Now came a rap at the door, and a voice
only a shade less respectful than before, saying,
"Miss Pittock is waiting below, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Very well, I will be down directly," said
Mrs. Bonnet. "Come here, Jetty!"</p>

<p>Jetty, instead of coming, ran round and
round among the chair legs, waving his tail
in a graceful circle, eluding Mrs. Bonnet's
hand not by swiftness, but craft.</p>

<p>"Come here, you little fool," muttered
Bonnet; and as her bidding, however severe,
availed nothing, she cast Mrs. Darling's
wrapper over the little beast, and got him
entangled like a black-and-tan butterfly in a
pocket-handkerchief. She snatched him up
squirming a little, tucked him tightly under
her arm, and ran up-stairs to her own chamber
on the third floor. There she dropped
him; and when she had donned her black
coat and bonnet, gloves and galoshes, during
which preparations Jetty was leaping and
yapping like crazy, in the supposition again
that they were going for a walk together,
she turned out the light and shut the door
against his wet, black nose. His reproach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>ful
barks followed her down the passage.
"It's good for 'is lungs," she said, grimly,
hurrying over the stairs.</p>

<div class="figcenter2em" id="illo4"><img src="images/illo4.jpg" width="500"
height="755" alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>"AT LAST THEY WERE GONE"</p>
</div></div>


<p class="p2">And here at the foot was Miss Pittock,
looking quite more than the lady in her mistress's
last year's cape.</p>

<p>"I hope I haven't kept you waiting, Miss
Pittock."</p>

<p>"Quite the contrary; don't mention it,
Mrs. Bonnet. Oh, the shops is a sight to
behold, Mrs. Bonnet! I never seen anything
like this year. It do seem as if people
made more to-do than they used about
Christmas, don't it? Are we ready, Mrs.
Bonnet?"</p>

<p>"I am if you are, Miss Pittock."</p>

<p>"Now, what kind of shops do you fancy
most, so we'll go and look into their show-windows
first?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know. What do you
prefer yourself, Miss Pittock? We've time
to see most everything of any account, anyhow.
She's not coming home before twelve."</p>

<p>"No more is mine. Suppose we go first
to the Grand Bazar. They've always got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the most amazing show there. That you,
Mr. Jackson? A merry Christmas to you,
Mr. Jackson, and a happy New Year!"</p>

<p>For just as they reached the door they
found the butler letting himself out too.
He did not sleep in the house, and was taking
the opportunity to-night to leave early.
For a second he could not return Miss Pittock's
salutation, his mouth being crowded
with a last bite snatched in haste. When he
had swallowed, he grinned and excused his
hurry, holding the door for the ladies.</p>

<p>"Sorry I ain't going your way, ladies," he
said, amiably, and the door closed behind the
three.</p>

<p>In the kitchen the cook, with a face like a
pleasant copper saucepan, rosy and shining
and round, was moving about leisurely, giving
this and that a final unhurried wipe.
She wore a face of contentment; it was her
legitimate night out; with a good conscience
presently she was going up to make a change,
and off to her family.</p>

<p>A young woman in a light gingham and
frilled cap sat watching her sulkily, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
hands idle on her embroidered muslin apron.
A girl of perhaps eighteen, capless, in a dark
calico that made not the first pretension to
elegance, was washing her face at one of the
shiny copper faucets. She vanished a moment,
and came back with her damp hair
streaked all over by the comb. The cook
was gone.</p>

<p>"You going, too, I suppose?" said the sullen
parlor-maid.</p>

<p>"Why, yes. 'Ain't I done everything?
There's no need of my staying, is there?"
The kitchen-maid went home for the night,
too.</p>

<p>"No, I don't suppose there is. I just
thought you might happen to be, that's all."</p>

<p>The kitchen-maid sat down a minute, in a
tired, ungirt position, and looked over at the
parlor-maid with good-natured young eyes
grown a trifle speculative. The latter let
her glance wander over the day's newspaper,
brought down-stairs until inquired for.</p>

<p>"Tell you what I'd like to do!" exclaimed
the kitchen-maid.</p>

<p>"What'd you like to do, Sally?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's to come back again after I've
been home for just a minute."</p>

<p>The parlor-maid looked up, unable altogether
to conceal her interest. The house
was very quiet. Through the clock-ticks,
at perfectly regular intervals, came the muffled
sound of Jetty's disconsolate yaps. Neither
of the girls appeared to hear them.</p>

<p>"You don't mean just to oblige, do you,
Sally?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'd do it in a minute for nothing
else beside, but that ain't quite all I was
thinking of just this once. Miss Catherine"&mdash;she
hesitated, then, enthusiastically&mdash;"have
you seen 'em up-stairs? the whole hundred
of 'em laid out off Mrs. Darling's bedroom?
I saw 'em when Mrs. Bonnet she sent me up
for the lamps to clean. Law! Wouldn't
any child like to see a sight like that!
There's a little girl in my tenement, she'd
just go crazy. Do you think there'd be any
harm in it if I was to bring her over and let
her get one peep? She's as clean a child as
ever you saw. She comes of dreadful poor
folks, but just as respectable! She never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
seen anything like it in her life. Law, what
would I have done when I was a young one
if I'd seen that? I'd thought I was dead
and gone to heaven. I say, Miss Catherine,
d' you think any one would mind?"</p>

<p>"How'll they know?" said Miss Catherine,
callously. "Look here, Sally; you go along
just as fast as you can and fetch your young
one. And when you've got back, perhaps
I'll step out a minute, two or three doors up
street, and you can answer the bell while I'm
gone. Now hurry into your things. I'll give
you your car fare."</p>

<p>"Miss Catherine, you're just as good as
you can be, and I'll do something to oblige
you, too, some time," said Sally, her face
aglow with delight; and having hurried into
her jacket and tied up her head in a worsted
muffler, was off.</p>

<p>She almost ran over the packed snow
down the street. She had soon left the
quiet rows of private dwelling-houses and
come where hundreds of lights glittered
across the rose-tinged snow. At every few
rods a street band tootled and blared, cov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>ering
the scraping of snow-shovels and jingle
of bells. "How gay it is!" she thought;
"won't it be a treat!"</p>

<p>She plunged into a mean, small street,
leading off a mean but tawdry larger one,
where things hung outside the shops with
their prices, written large, pinned on them,
and had soon come to the house where her
family lived.</p>

<p>She went in like a great gust of fresh air.
In less than five minutes she came out, leading
by the hand a little girl who, from being
very much bundled up about the shoulders,
and having brief petticoats above thin black
legs, looked top-heavy. She was obliged to
nearly run to keep up with Sally, and was
trying to get out words through the breathlessness
occasioned by hurrying and laughing
and coming so suddenly into the frosty
air.</p>

<p>"Oh, lemme guess, Sal, and tell me when
I'm hot. Is it made of sugar?"</p>

<p>"No, it ain't."</p>

<p>"But you said it was a treat, didn't you,
Sally?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did that. But ain't there all sorts of
treats? There's going to the circus, for instance.
That hasn't any sugar."</p>

<p>"Is it a circus, Sally? Is it a circus?"</p>

<p>"No, it ain't a circus, but it's every bit as
nice."</p>

<p>"Is it freaks, Sally? oh, tell me if it's
freaks? It isn't? Are you sure I shall like
it very much? It's nothing to eat, and it's
nothing I can have to keep, and it's not a
circus. What color is it? You'll answer
straight, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's every color in the world, and
striped and polka-dotted and crinkled and
smooth. There's a hundred of it."</p>

<p>The child would have stopped short on the
sidewalk the better to centre her mind on
guessing, but Sally dragged her briskly along.
At the top of the street they came to a standstill.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the child.</p>

<p>"We're going to take the car," said Sally,
grandly.</p>

<p>"O&mdash;h!" breathed the child.</p>

<p>"I guess you never stepped on to one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
these before. This, Tibbie, is nothing but
the beginning. Hi! Hi!"</p>

<p>The swiftly gliding, fiery, formidable car
stopped, and the hoarse buzz died out in a
grinding of brakes; the light was dimmed a
minute, then flared out again, as if the monster
had winked. Sally and Tibbie climbed on; it
moved, banging and whirring on its farther
way. They had to stand, of course, but
what of that? Tibbie looked all about with
her shining, intelligent brown eyes, and felt
a flush of gratified pride to see Sally, when
the conductor had squeezed himself near,
pay like the others; it had seemed impossible
that some compromise should not have
to be made with him. She slipped her hand
in Sally's, and was too occupied with the
people and the colored advertisements to
talk.</p>

<p>"Did you get anything for Christmas yet,
Tibbie?"</p>

<p>She moved her head up and down, bestowing
all her attention on a parcel-laden
woman bound to drop something the next
time she stirred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"What did you get?"</p>

<p>"A doll's flat-iron and a muslin bag of
candy. I put the iron on to heat, and it
melted. I gave what was left to Jimmy."</p>

<p>"Who gave them to you?"</p>

<p>"Off the Sunday-school tree. But there
were no lights on it, because it was daytime.
Sally, I know something that has a hundred&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's that? Let's see if you've got it
now?"</p>

<p>Tibbie looked a little shamefaced, then
said, "A dollar&mdash;is a hundred cents."</p>

<p>"Well, and would I be bringing you so far
just to show you a dollar? This is worth as
much as a dollar, every individual one of
them. Tibbie, it's just the grandest sight
you ever seen&mdash;pink and blue and yellow
and striped&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tibbie, who was looking Sally fixedly in
the face, as if to see if her secret anywhere
transpired, now almost shouted, "It's marbles!"</p>

<p>"Aw, but you're downright stupid, Tibbie.
I don't mind telling you I'm disap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>pointed.
You're just a common, every-day
sort of young one, with no idear of grandness
in your idears at all. And you don't
seem to keep a hold on more than one notion
at a time. First it's a dollar. Is that
pink and blue? And next it's marbles. Is
marbles worth a dollar apiece? Now tell me
what's the grandest, prettiest thing that ever
you saw&mdash;"</p>

<p>"... Angels."</p>

<p>"D' you ever see any?"</p>

<p>"In the church window, painted."</p>

<p>"Well, this is as handsome as a hundred
angels, less than a foot tall, all in new
clothes, with little hats on."</p>

<p>"Sally, I think I know now. Only it
couldn't be that. There couldn't likely be
a hundred of them all together, for, oh, Sally,
it isn't a store we are going to! You didn't
tell me it was a store."</p>

<p>"No more it is. We're going straight to
Mrs. Darling's house, and no place but there.
Here's where we get off."</p>

<p>The big girl, with the small one, alighted
and turned into the quieter streets, Tibbie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
as before, almost running to keep up with
her long-legged friend.</p>

<p>They went into Mrs. Darling's by the
back door. In the kitchen stood Miss Catherine
in a coat with jet spangles and a hat
with nodding plumes, pulling on a pair of
tight kid gloves.</p>

<p>Tibbie at sight of her hung back, murmuring
to Sally, "You didn't tell me! You
didn't tell me!"</p>

<p>"Now, you'll be sure she don't touch anything,
Sally," said Miss Catherine, looking
Tibbie over.</p>

<p>"Naw! She won't hurt anything. I've
told her I'll skin her if she does."</p>

<p>"Are her hands clean? You'd better give
them a wash, anyhow."</p>

<p>Tibbie dropped her eyes, a little mortified.</p>

<p>"All right! I'll wash 'em," said Sally.</p>

<p>"She'd better scrape her boots thoroughly
on the mat, too, before going up."</p>

<p>"I'll look after all that, Miss Catherine.
Just you go long with an easy mind."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm off. I won't be long. Why
don't you give her a piece of that cake? It's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
cut. But make her eat it down here. Good-night,
little girl. I guess you never was in a
house like this before. Good-night, Sal. Is
my hat on straight?"</p>

<p>She was gone, and the whole house now
belonged to Sally and Tibbie. They looked
at each other in silence a moment; the glee
they felt came shining to the surface of their
faces and made them grin broadly at each
other.</p>

<p>"She's particular, ain't she?" said Sally.</p>

<p>"I just as soon wash them again, but
they're clean. I thought you said she was
gone off to a party and going to be gone till
real late."</p>

<p>"Law!" roared Sally, and plumped down
to contort herself in comfort. "She thought
it was Mrs. Darling herself! Law! law!"</p>

<p>Tibbie laughed, too, but not so heartily,
and the great time began.</p>

<p>Sally went for the cake-box, and Tibbie
made a thoughtful selection; and "Who'll
ever find a few crumbs?" said Sally. "Come
along!"</p>

<p>The great child and the little, full of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
sense of play, went up the stairs hand in
hand. Tibbie could scarcely take account
of what was happening to her, such was the
pure delight of the adventure.</p>

<p>"This is the dining-room; this is the sitting-room;
this is the receiving-room; this,
now prepare&mdash;this is Mrs. Darling's own
room!"</p>

<p>Up went the light; the rose-paper walls,
the rose-chintz dumpy chairs, the silver-laden
dressing-table, the pink and white draped
bed, leaped into sight. Tibbie stood still,
open-lipped.</p>

<p>"Ain't it handsome?" asked Sally, with
the pride of indirectly belonging to such
things. "Come along, I'm going to wash
your hands in Mrs. Darling's basin."</p>

<p>She drew Tibbie, who gazed backward
over her shoulder, into the little alcove where
the marble wash-stand was, and turned on
stiff jets of hot and cold water together. At
the sweet odor of the soap tablet pushed
under her nose, Tibbie's attention was won
to the operations of washing and wiping.</p>

<p>"But where is there a hundred of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>thing?"
she asked, faintly, looking all
about.</p>

<p>"Oh, this ain't it yet! This is only like
the outside entry. Now, Miss Tibbs, what
kind of scent will you have on your hands?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Sal!"</p>

<p>"Shall it be Violet, or Russian Empress,
or&mdash;what's this other&mdash;Lilass Blank? or the
anatomizer played over them like the garden-hose?"</p>


<p>They unstopped the bottles in turn, and
drew up out of them great, noisy, luxurious
breaths. "This, Sally, this," said Tibbie at
the one with the double name like a person.
Sally poured a drop in her little rough, red
hands, and she danced as she rubbed them
together.</p>

<p>"Why are the little scissors crooked?" she
asked, busily picking up and putting down
things one after the other. "What for is
the fluting-irons? What for is the butter in
the little chiny jar? What's the flour for in
the silver box? Oh, what's this? Oh, Sal,
what's that?"</p>

<p>Sally picked up the powder-puff and gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
her little friend, who drew back startled and
coughing, a dusty dab with it on each cheek.
"It's to make you pale," she said. "It ain't
fashionable to be red." She applied the puff
to her own cheeks as well. The two stood
gazing in silent interest at themselves in the
mirror, and gradually broke into smiles at
the incongruous reflection. Sally suddenly
bent one cheek, hitched up one shoulder, and
brushed half her face clean; then did the
same by the other cheek with her other
shoulder. Tibbie, who had watched her,
aped her movement faithfully. They looked
at themselves again, and Tibbie remarked,
"But I ain't red, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Law! that you ain't! When are you
going to begin to get some fat on your
bones, Tibbie, or to grow?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Who's the gentleman,
Sal, in the pretty frame?"</p>

<p>"That's Mrs.'s husband. He ain't been
living some time."</p>

<p>"Oh, he isn't living. Listen, listen, Sally!
What's that noise I keep hearing? I've
heard it ever since we came."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Sally listened. "That? That's Jetty. It's
a little bit of a dog, up at the top of the
house."</p>

<p>"Oh, a little bit of a dog! Why does he
bark all the time?"</p>

<p>"I guess Mrs. Bonnet shut him up there
alone in the dark till she came back from
gadding with Miss Pittock."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we get him, Sally? I hate to
hear him. I want to see him awfully."</p>

<p>"All right. You wait here. But don't
you hurt anything, or I'll skin you, sure, like
I told Miss Catherine. And whatever you
do, don't you go into the little room till I
come back."</p>

<p>"Is the hundred there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's there."</p>

<p>Tibbie, left alone, looked at the half-open
door a minute, then turned away from it: all
was so interesting, anyhow, she could wait
with grace. With the palm of her hand,
which she frequently stopped to smell, she
stroked the fine linen pillows on the bed,
and the white bear rugs on the floor, and the
curtains: everything felt so soft. She ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>amined
the features of the Rev. Dorel Goodhue
with approbation, proposing to ask Sally
whether she knew him.</p>

<p>The bark came nearer and nearer; when
the door opened, in tumbled a small silky
ball of black dog, who almost turned himself
inside out in his delight at being in
human company again. He ran floppily
about and about the floor, in his conscious,
cringing, graceful way, waving his tail round
and round, tossing back his long silk ears to
bark and bark.</p>

<p>At last the girls between them had him
caught. He was squeezed tight in Tibbie's
arms, where he wriggled and twitched, covering
her cheeks and ears with rapid dog-kisses,
interspersed still with rapturous
barks. "Oh, oh!" cried Tibbie, trying vainly
to hold him still long enough to get a
good kiss at him. "Isn't he soft? Isn't
he sweet? And he has a yellow ribbon.
Oh, do keep quiet, doggie dear&mdash;you
tickle!"</p>

<p>"I don't think we will bother any more
about seeing the hundred," said Sally, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
feigned coldness in her tone, and stood aloof
watching child and dog.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten, honest, Sally."</p>

<p>"Put him down and come on, then."</p>

<p>"Mayn't I hold him and come too?"</p>

<p>"No; for when you see 'em, you'll drop
him so quick you'll like as not break his
legs."</p>

<p>"All right. Down, Jetty! Down, sir!
Come along, Jetty; come right along, dear!"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. I'll go in first and turn
up the light. When I sing out, you come
on."</p>

<p>She went ahead, and Jetty precipitated
himself at her heels. Tibbie stooped with
anxious inducing noises, and "Come back,
sir! Come back!"</p>

<p>"Ready!" shouted Sally.</p>

<p>Tibbie made a bound for the door, but at
a step's distance was overcome by a curious
timidity, and instead of bolting in, pulled
the door towards her tremulously, and pushed
aside the lace hanging with a cold hand.</p>

<p>There lay the hundred, all on a couch under
the gas-light, arranged as in a show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>-window,
propped by means of silk cushions
so as to form a solid sloping bank&mdash;the
hundred beautiful dolls.</p>

<p>"Well, ma'am?" asked Sally, expectantly.</p>

<p>Tibbie said nothing, but looked at them
vaguely, full of constraint.</p>

<p>"Well, I never!" said Sally. "Don't you
like 'em? What on earth did you expect,
child? Well, I never! Well, if it don't beat
all! Why, when I was a young one&mdash;Why,
Tibbie girl&mdash;don't you think they are
<i>lovely</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered, moving her head
slowly up and down, then letting it hang.</p>

<p>"Aw, come out of that," said Sally, understanding.
"Come, let's look at 'em one by
one, taking all our time. Come to Sally,
darling, and don't feel bad. We'll have lots
of fun."</p>

<p>She took the not unwilling Tibbie by the
hand, and led her nearer the banked splendor.</p>

<p>The dolls were all of a size, and, undressed,
would with difficulty have been told apart,
except, perhaps, by their little mothers. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
were very blond and wide-eyed and bow-lipped;
all, though dressed like little ladies,
had the chubby hands of infants; and their
boots were painted trimly on with black,
and their garters with blue. But how to
render the coquettish fashionableness with
which these wax-complexioned darlings were
tricked out! all equally in silks and satins
and velvets and lace, so that there could be
no jealousies; all with hats of like beauty
and stylishness.</p>

<p>Sally seated herself on the floor beside the
low couch, and pulled Tibbie down into her
lap, who drew up Jetty into hers. Tibbie
had recovered the power to speak, but was
still unduly sober and husky.</p>

<p>"I had almost guessed it, you know," she
said, "when you said like angels with hats
on. But I couldn't think there would be a
hundred unless it was a store. What has
the lady so many for?"</p>

<p>"Bless your heart! They ain't for herself!
They are for orphans in a school that
a minister-cousin of hers is superintendent
of. She has been over a month making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
these clothes. Every Wednesday she would
give a tea party, and a lot of ladies come
and sit stitching and snipping and buzzing
over the dolls' clothes the blessed afternoon.
And I washed the tea things after
them all!"</p>

<p>"They are for the orphans. Are there a
hundred orphans?"</p>

<p>"I guess likely."</p>

<p>"Suppose, Sally&mdash;suppose there were only
ninety-nine, and some girl got two!"</p>

<p>"Well, we two have got a hundred for to-night,
Tibbie, so let's play, and glad enough
we've got our mothers. Look, this is the
way you must hold them to be sure of not
crumpling anything."</p>

<p>She slipped her hand deftly under a doll's
petticoats, and they peeped discreetly at the
dainty under-clothes, crisp and snowy, more
lace than linen.</p>

<p>"My soul and body! Did you ever see
the like!" exclaimed Sally, spurring on Tibbie's
enthusiasm by the tone of her voice,
making the wonder more, to fill her little
friend's soul to intoxication. Tibbie easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
responded. She fairly rocked herself to and
fro with delight.</p>

<p>"And not a pin among 'em," sighed Sally.
"All pearl buttons and silk tying-strings and
silver hooks and eyes; and, mercy on my
soul! a little bit of a pocket in every dress,
with its little bit of a lace pocket-handkerchief
inside. D'you see that, Tibbie? And
not two alike!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but there are some <i>'most</i> alike!" said
the quick-eyed Tibbie; "only, scattered far
apart. There are three with the little rose-bud
silk, and here's more than one with the
speckled muslin. Perhaps those will be given
to sisters."</p>

<p>"Come on, Tibbie; let's choose the one
we would choose to get, if we was to get
one given us. Now, I would like that one
in red velvet. It's just so dressy, ain't it,
with the gold braid sewed down in a pattern
round the bottom. Which would you
take?"</p>

<p>"I should like the one all in white. She
must be a bride; see, she has a wreath and
veil and necklace. I should like her the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
very best. But right after that, if I could
have two, I should like this other in the
shade-hat with the forget-me-nots, and
forget-me-nots dotted all over her dress.
And, see! the sky-blue hair-ribbon. If I
could just have three of them, then I would
take this one too, with the black lace shawl
over her head fastened with roses instead of a
hat. She has such a lovely face! And after
her I would choose this one in green&mdash;or
this one in pink; no, this one here, Sally,
just look&mdash;this one in green and pink. And
you, if you could have more than one, which
would you choose, after the red one?"</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I'd choose this one in
white."</p>

<p>"Oh no, Sally; don't you remember?
That is the bride, the one I said the very
first. You can have all the others, Sally
dear, except the bride. But let's see, perhaps
there are two brides. Yes!&mdash;no!&mdash;that
is just a little girl in white, without a wreath.
Should you like her as well? I was the first
to say the bride, you know."</p>

<p>"Law! I wouldn't have wanted her if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
had known she was a bride! I take this
one, Tibbie&mdash;this one with the feathers in
her hat. Ain't she the gay girl, in red and
green plaid! And this purple silk one, and
this red and white stripe, and this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait! That's enough, Sally; that makes
four for you. It's my turn now. If I could
have five, I should take one of the rose-bud
ones&mdash;no, two of them, so's to play I had
twins. Say, Sally, let's choose one apiece&mdash;first
you one, then me one, till we've chosen
them all up, and got fifty apiece. Your turn."</p>

<p>They chose and chose, pointing each time,
and detailing the costume of the chosen one
aloud with the greatest enjoyment.</p>

<p>Jetty had laid himself down beside them,
stretched his silky length, his nose between
his paws. He was very tired. Perhaps
among the things his great moist eyes were
wondering about was the reason of this fatigue
in his vocal chords.</p>

<p>"For my forty-fifth one," said Sally, placing
her forefinger pensively against the side
of her nose, "I choose her&mdash;her with the little
black velvets run all through."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Taken already," said Tibbie, promptly.</p>

<p>"Then her over there, with the short puffy
sleeves."</p>

<p>"Taken!"</p>

<p>"She taken too? Well, then, her in the
pink Mother Hubbard with the little knitting-bag
on her arm."</p>

<p>"Taken, Sally! Can't you remember anything?
Those belong to me; I chose them
long ago. These are the only not taken
ones; here and here and here and here and
here and here and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw, you're a great girl!" cried Sally,
suddenly throwing her arms around Tibbie
and casting herself backward on the floor
with her, where they tumbled and rolled,
laughing, Jetty jumping about on top of
them, barking hoarsely in a frenzy of fun.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tibbie, ain't we having a time of it?"</p>

<p>And Tibbie almost shouted, "Yes!&mdash;ain't
we having a time of it!"</p>

<p>"Ain't this a night?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes!&mdash;ain't it a night!"</p>

<p>Sally tickled and poked her affectionately;
and she tried to tickle Sally, and laughed till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
she was almost hysterical, and never remembered
who she was, or thought of anything
outside this little room, but was filled with a
sense of the crazy deliciousness of the moment.</p>

<p>At last, weak with laughter, she disentangled
herself from the still panting and
laughing Sally on the floor, and insisted on
returning to the business of the distribution.
She felt in the mood to be very funny. She
jerked herself up and down and all about in
a senseless sort of way.</p>

<p>"Here, Sally, now stop laughing and let's
finish. It was your turn. You'd best take
that one; she looks more as if she might be
a little girl of yours, her cheeks are so red&mdash;red
as a great big cabbage!" This remark
seemed to Tibbie so inexpressibly humorous
that she laughed again till she nearly cried.</p>

<p>"Well, it's sure none of 'em has legs to
make 'em look like children of yours," retorted
Sally; and that seemed a greater joke
still. With a foal's action, Tibbie flung out
the thin black legs with the awkward boots
at the ends of them, and dropped to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
floor squirming and laughing. Sally caught
her suddenly again, and cast herself backward
with her as before, in a gale of mirth.</p>

<p>There they were frolicking, when the peal
of a bell rang brightly across their giggles.</p>

<p>Sally sat up instantly, and all in Mrs.
Darling's house was for a long moment still
as the very grave, for Sally had instinctively
clapped her hand over Jetty's ready
muzzle.</p>

<p>"Murder!" whispered Sally, solemnly, at
last.</p>

<p>"What is it?" breathed Tibbie in her ear.</p>

<p>"Was it the front door or the back door?"
asked Sally.</p>

<p>"I dun'no', Sally."</p>

<p>Sally had picked herself up, and was stroking
down her things.</p>

<p>Tibbie stood beside her, looking up in her
face, her own a trifle pale.</p>

<p>Sally's irresolution lasted only a second.
She cast an eye on the dolls, saw that they
were very nearly as she had found them,
and turned down the light. She looked
about Mrs. Darling's room to see that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
was as usual, and turned down the lights
there too, after glancing at the clock.</p>

<p>"It ain't late," she murmured. "It ain't
a bit later than I supposed. It can't be her!
It might be Mrs. Bonnet, though, getting
home before Catherine, who's got the key.
I shouldn't want her to catch you here for
the whole world. Look here, Tibbie. You
stand in here till I find out who it is, and if
it's Mrs. Bonnet, you'll have to stay hidden
till I find a good chance to come and smuggle
you down."</p>

<p>Tibbie waited in the farthest corner of the
hall closet, holding her breath, conscious of
nothing at first but excitement and fear of
she did not know quite what. After a little,
the thought drifted across her fervent hope
for present safety, that though she got well
out of this scrape, she would probably never
see those radiant dollies again, her own half
or Sally's.</p>

<p>She heard a whiffling and scratching at
the closet door. Here was Jetty, dear Jetty,
whose actions would surely betray her to
Mrs. Bonnet when she came that way. Tib<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>bie
whispered: "Go right away, Jetty.
There's no one in this closet; go right
away!" and pressed backward to the wall,
among the water-proofs, feeling like a little
criminal with the police on her track.</p>

<p>"Tibbie!" came Sally's voice from the
foot of the stairs: it sounded perfectly calm,
and pleasant with a sort of company pleasantness.
"It's all right. It's just a friend
dropped in for a moment. You can go in
again and play a little longer. Turn up the
light carefully. But remember what I told
you."</p>

<p>Tibbie instantly forgot all her fears. She
came out and picked up Jetty; she kissed
him, explaining why she had told him to
go away. The doggie seemed to bear no
malice.</p>

<p>Tibbie tiptoed into the doll-room, and established
herself on her knees before the
dolls, happier than before, with a profounder
happiness, in a stiller, almost devotional
mood. It was so different being alone with
them, having them quite to herself, to play
with in her own way. She took up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
bride with a reverent hand, and after long
contemplating her, very seriously, tenderly
kissed her. Then, touching them as if they
had been snow-flakes almost, she moved the
impressive little persons about, until her
fifty were on one side and Sally's on the
other.</p>

<p>"I can't play they're a family," she reflected;
"they are too many all the same
age, and all girls. I will play they are a
hundred girls in an orphan asylum&mdash;a very
rich orphan asylum&mdash;and that I am the superintendent.
To-morrow I am going to give
each a beautiful doll for a Christmas present.
This little girl's name is Rosa. That
one is Nelly. That one is Katy. That one
is Sue." She named every one, passing
through the list of such names as Golden-locks,
Cherrylips, Diamondeyes, to end with
such invented ones as Kirry, Mirry, Dirry,
Birry. They seemed so much completer with
names. Tibbie would say, "Miss Snowdrop!"
And Miss Snowdrop, with Tibbie's assistance,
would rise, answering, "Yes, ma'am."
"Spell knot." "N&mdash;O&mdash;T!" "Not at all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
my dear. Sit down again, my dear. Miss
Lily; stand up, miss, and see if you can do
any better this morning."</p>

<p>Suddenly, after having taken the asylum
through a day's exercises, Tibbie tired of
being the superintendent. She craved a relation
more intimate, more affectionate, with
the dollies. She did not believe a superintendent
would have kissed and fondled them
as she longed to do. She selected a dozen
or so, to play they were her children. She
gave them their supper; she washed them
and made them say their prayers. She told
them it was bedtime, and she would now
rock them to sleep. She turned down the
light, to make all very real, and drawing out
a low rocking-chair that seemed made for
her purpose, seated herself in it with two
dolls on each arm, the rest made as comfortable
as possible on her lap; for not one
of them, after being included in the family,
could, of course, be left out of the rocking.
She rocked gently, now hushing, now
singing "Bye-low-low-baby," her maternal
heart swollen very large. In time, one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the daughters became fractious and restless;
she had to have medicine, and the rocking
for her sake had to become almost violent.
Nothing would soothe her but that the chair
should rock backward and forward to the
very tip ends of its rockers. This had its
good effect at last; all the dolls were fast
asleep, and the mother, her duty done, composed
herself to take a well-earned rest too.
This thought was no doubt suggested to
Tibbie by the fact that she was really getting
sleepy. It was long past her bedtime.</p>

<p>She was not far from napping when she
became aware of Sally saying: "Lively, Tibbie!
Miss Catherine has got back. We
must be packing off home. I declare I lost
sight of the time. There's just no one like a
fireman to be entertaining, I declare. Mrs.
Bonnet won't be long coming now."</p>

<p>She turned up the light, and saw the dolls
so disarranged.</p>

<p>Tibbie was rubbing her eyes.</p>

<p>"Law!" said Sally, a little blankly. "Do
you suppose we can get them to look as
they did? I hope t' Heaven she didn't know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
which went next to which. Do you remember,
Tibbie, where each belonged?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The bride went here. The rose-buds
here. The purple and gray here. I
can put them all back, every one."</p>

<p>"Oh, we're all right!" said Sally, cheerfully
again. "No one'll ever know in the
world they've been disturbed."</p>

<p>She had drawn off to get the general effect,
and compare it with the earlier image
in her brain, when she made a dive for one
of the dolls, the last one, that the sleepy
Tibbie had handed her up off the floor.</p>

<p>"Tibbie!" she said, in a ghastly whisper,
"look at its head!"</p>

<p>Something had happened to it, certainly.
Its pink-and-white face was pushed in; it
looked very much as if a chair-rocker had
gone over it. Tibbie looked at it, not understanding
at all.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tibbie!" groaned Sally, "now what'll
we do!"</p>

<p>"I didn't do it," said Tibbie, lifting a pale
face with perfectly truthful eyes. "I was
just as careful! She was one of my daugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>ters;
I had her in my lap rocking her to
sleep with the others; she must have slipped
off my lap&mdash;there were too many for one
lap, I guess&mdash;but I didn't step on her.
Sure, Sally&mdash;sure as I live, I didn't step on
her!"</p>

<p>"Oh, law! You must have rocked on
her. Oh, Tibbie, what'll I do!"</p>

<p>She picked up the doll to examine it, but
saw at once that the little face could not be
made right again.</p>

<p>Tibbie watched her without a word; her
voice seemed to have sunk far below reach.</p>

<p>Sally moved the dolls about tentatively,
so that ninety-nine should cover the same
space as a hundred. Certainly at first
glance the one she held would never be
missed. "But what's the good?" she said,
throwing it down. "They'll count them,
and there'll be the mischief of a fuss. Oh,
Tibbie"&mdash;and she had reached the end of
her good-nature&mdash;"why did I ever think of
bringing you here? Now look at all the
trouble you've brought on me, when I thought
you'd be so careful! And I told you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
told you till I was hoarse. And here you've
ruined all!"</p>

<p>Tibbie's eyes could not bear to meet Sally's.
She stood with her hands behind her,
speechless and motionless, in the middle of
the floor.</p>

<p>"I declare I don't know what to do!" Sally
exclaimed, dropping her arms and sitting
down before the wreck. "I wish I'd never
seen 'em! I wish there'd never been any
Christmas! Oh, it's a great job, this! Tibbie,
you've done for me this time!"</p>

<p>At this moment Miss Catherine came in
to hurry them.</p>

<p>"She's broken one of them!" blurted out
Sally.</p>

<p>"You don't mean it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, she has!"</p>

<p>"Let me see it. Oh, you wicked child!
She's smashed its face right in! Now who
ever heard of such naughtiness?"</p>

<p>Tibbie twisted about ever so little, to get
her back turned towards the two.</p>

<p>"She didn't do it out of naughtiness at
all, Miss Catherine. She's as good a child as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
ever lived!" At that Tibbie's shoulders gave
a little convulsive heave. "It was an accident
entirely. But that's just as bad for
me. I suppose I shall have to say it was
me did it."</p>

<p>"And then they'll say what was I doing
while the kitchen help was poking about in
the Mrs.'s chamber. No; you don't get me
into trouble, Sally Bean! You'd much better
say how it was&mdash;how that you asked me
if you just might bring a little girl to look,
and I said you might, out of pure good-nature,
being Christmas is rightly for children,
and I've a softness for them. And
while we was both in the kitchen, she slipped
away from us and came here and done it
before we knew. And the child herself will
say that it was so. You'll be packed off
dead sure out of this place if you let on you
meddled with them yourself. She won't
have her things meddled with&mdash;There
goes the bell. There comes that old cat
Bonnet."</p>

<p>She hurried off to open.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" said Mrs. Bonnet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
elevating her eyebrows as she appeared at
the door and looked into the room she had
expected to find dark and still. She held a
paper bag; she spoke with an impediment
and a breath of peppermint. Her cheek-bones
and the end of her nose were brilliant
pink with the cold. "What child is that?"</p>

<p>Miss Catherine was behind Mrs. Bonnet.
"It happened this way, Mrs. Bonnet," she
began, and told the story with a little tactful
adaptation to the intelligence of her audience,
ending, "And now, Mrs. Bonnet, what's
to be done?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you wicked little brat!" said Mrs.
Bonnet. "I just want to get hold of you
and shake you!"</p>

<p>She made a snatch at Tibbie, who instinctively
got beyond her clutch, and turning
scared eyes towards Sally, said, just audibly,
"I want to go home; I want to go
home."</p>

<p>"It don't seem possible," said Mrs. Bonnet,
bitterly, "that I can't run out a minute
just to do an errand for Mrs. Darling herself&mdash;to
get a spool of feather-stitching silk&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
things like this has to happen. Catherine,
I thought you, at least, was a responsible
person, and here you has to go and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bonnet," Catherine interrupted, "you
just let that alone! Don't you try none of
that with me! I went out of an errand
every bit as much as you did. I went out
to make sure the ice-cream would be sent
in good season for Christmas dinner, I did.
Now I don't get dragged into this mess one
bit more than you do!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bonnet looked at her with a poison-green
eye. She seemed to be repressing
what was a trifle difficult to keep the upper
hand of.</p>

<p>"Well," she exclaimed at last, "Mrs. Darling
will be here in a minute, and then we
shall all see what we shall see. Lord, ain't
that woman been cross to-day, and fussy!
'Tain't as if she was like other people&mdash;a
little bit sensible, and could take some little
few things into consideration, and remember
we are all human flesh and blood. Not
much! She don't consider nothing, nor nobody,
nor feelings, nor circumstances! She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
just makes things fly! Things has to go her
way, every time!"</p>

<p>"I want to go home," cried Tibbie, pathetically,
and looked towards Sally now
with a trembling face.</p>

<p>"No, you sha'n't go home," said Bonnet,
uglily. "You shall stay right here and take
the blame you deserve, after spoiling the
face of that handsome doll. What do you
mean by it, you little brat, you little gutter
imp?"</p>

<p>"You let her alone, Mrs. Bonnet," said
Sally, with a boldness that had never before
characterized her relations with that lady.
"Don't you talk to her like that! Any one
can see she's as sorry as sorry can be for
what she's done, and all the trouble she's
got us into&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And what does that help, I'd like to
know? The doll is broke, ain't it? And
some one of us is going to catch it, however
things go. You're a lucky girl, I say, if you
don't lose your place. Some one of us is
going to, I can easy foretell."</p>

<p>"I ain't going to lose my place," said Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Catherine, firmly; and with a lifted chin was
leaving to lay off her things, when the cook's
nice copper-saucepan face was pushed a little
inside the door.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" she asked, cheerily,
and stepped in. Her high-colored shawl
was pinned on her breast with a big brooch;
her bonnet-strings were nearly lost in her
fat chin. "What's it all about? Whose
nice little girl is this?"</p>

<p>Gradually she got the whole story, and
going straight to Tibbie lifted her miserable
little face, saying: "Don't you feel bad one
bit, darlin'! It was all an accident, and it's
no good crying over spilt milk. And if Mrs.
Darling gets mad at you, she ain't the real
lady I take her for. Why, I gave my Clary
a new doll to-night, and it's ready for a
new head this minute. And did I stop
to rear and tear about it? Not a bit of it.
Why, bless you, she didn't go for to do it!
What child smashes a doll a purpose? You're
a pretty set, the whole gang of you, to pitch
into a mite like this!"</p>

<p>Tibbie by this time was freely weeping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and Sally and the cook together were trying
to comfort and silence her.</p>

<p>"I've a great mind to stay here myself and
stand up for her, yer pack of old maids, the
lot of yer!" said the cook, looking hard at
Mrs. Bonnet, who had reappeared without
her hat and coat.</p>

<p>"You will oblige me, Mrs. MacGrath, by
doing nothing of the sort," said Mrs. Bonnet.
"We've no need to have a whole scene
from the drama. You've no business on this
floor anyhow, and I must insist on your keeping
yourself in your own quarters."</p>

<p>"And I'll take my own time, yer born
Britisher," said Mrs. MacGrath. Then putting
her arm around Tibbie: "Well, Tibbie
dear, you can be sure of this: however
bad this seems, it'll soon be over. And if
Mrs. Darling does scold, it'll soon be over
too. It'll all be looking different to you in
the morning. However things goes, you'll
soon be forgetting all about it. And to-morrow
is Christmas Day, that our own dear
Lord was born on, and I'll bake you a little
cake and send it to you by Sally."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"But Sally's going to be sent away,"
sobbed Tibbie.</p>

<p>"So she might be, but I feel it in my little
toe that she ain't going to be."</p>

<p>"Well, and if I am, I am, and there an
end," said Sally, bravely. "But I don't see
why she can't take the price of the doll out
of my wages and let me stay."</p>

<p>"I think you'll find," said Mrs. Bonnet,
"that it ain't most particularly the cost of
the doll gets you into trouble&mdash;There she
comes this minute!"</p>

<p>The door-bell had rung. Profound silence
reigned above, while all listened. Tibbie
stopped crying.</p>

<p>"Good-night," came Mrs. Darling's sweet
voice, presently, floating up from the foot of
the stairs.</p>

<p>"Good-night," came the Rev. Dorel Goodhue's.</p>

<p>There was a rustle of silken skirts.</p>

<p>"Oh, Cousin Cynthia!"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"At ten, did you say&mdash;or half past?"</p>

<p>"I said ten&mdash;<i>or</i> half past. Good-night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>More rustling of skirts; then,</p>

<p>"Oh, Cousin Dorel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" from the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter&mdash;what we spoke about,
you know, unless perfectly convenient."</p>

<p>"Oh, but it will be convenient, perfectly.
Good-night. Sleep well."</p>

<p>"You too. Pleasant dreams. Good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night."</p>

<p>The rustling drew nearer, and Mrs. Darling
stood in the doorway, looking with a sort
of absent-minded astonishment at the assemblage
in her room.</p>

<p>The violets were quite dead on her white
bosom; her hair was beginning to come
loose, and stood out in golden wisps about
her flushed face. She looked very sweet
and soft and shiny-eyed and pleasant altogether.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked; and as Jetty
was evoluting and clamoring about her feet
she picked him up and kissed him like a
mother. "Has anything happened? What
is everybody doing up here? Whose little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
girl is this sitting up so late? They used to
tell me I should never grow, my dear, if I
sat up so late&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is what it is, ma'am," began Mrs.
Bonnet; and she told her arrangement of
the story, uttering her words as a mowing-machine
cuts weeds.</p>

<p>Mrs. Darling abstractedly took the rocking-chair;
as she listened, the pleasant, happy
look forsook her face.</p>

<p>"Oh, cut it short!" she interrupted, sharply.
"What you have to tell is that the
child there has broken one of the dolls, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>There was an assenting mutter from Mrs.
Bonnet.</p>

<p>"And you've kept her here, when she
ought to have been in bed these hours, to
bear the first beauty of my displeasure&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Darling had said so much in a hard
voice, with an appearance of cold anger;
here her voice suddenly died, and she burst
out crying like a vexed, injured child. "I
<i>declare</i> it is too bad!" she sobbed, quite
reckless of making a spectacle of herself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
while all looked on and listened in consternation&mdash;"I
declare it is too bad! It's no use!
It doesn't matter <i>what</i> I do&mdash;it is always
the same! It is <i>always</i> taken for granted I
will conduct myself like a beast. Who can
wonder, after that, if I do? Here I find
them, pale as sheets, the five of them, shaking
in their boots because a forlorn little
child has broken a miserable doll. And <i>what</i>
is it supposed I shall do about it? Didn't I
dress the hundred of them for children, and
little poor children too? And I must have
known they would get broken, of course.
<i>Why</i> did I dress them? <i>What</i> did I spend
months dressing them for? Solely for <i>show</i>,
they think&mdash;not for any charity, any kindness,
any love of children, or anything in the
<i>world</i> but to make an effect on an occasion,
I suppose&mdash;to make myself a merit with the
parson, perhaps!" Here her crying seemed
to become less of anger and nervousness, and
more of sorrow; one would have thought
her heart-broken. "Oh, it is too bad! One
would imagine I never said a decent thing,
or did a kind act, to any one. And Heaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
knows it is not for lack of trying to change.
But no one sees the difference! I am treated
like a vixen and a terror. All the people
about me hate and fear and deceive me! A
proof of it to-night! Oh, the <i>lesson</i>! Oh, I
wasn't <i>meant</i> for this! I wasn't meant for
it! When I remember last Sunday's sermon,
and how straight to my heart it went&mdash;oh,
I am a fool to cry! Come here to me,
dear child. What is your name? What?
A little louder! What did you say? Tibbie!
Oh, what a nice, funny name!" Mrs.
Darling smiled through her tears, pathetically
hiccoughing and sighing while she spoke.
"<i>You</i> didn't think I was going to scold you,
did you, dear? Of <i>course</i> not! It was an
accident; I understand all about it. I used
to break my dolls' heads frequently, I remember
very well&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Darling had put her arm endearingly
around Tibbie, and tried to make the
child's head easy on her shoulder. But poor
Tibbie's muscles could not relax; her stiff
little face rested uncomfortably, without
pressing, upon its warm alabaster prop. "Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
us see, dear, now, what we can do to make
us both feel happier. I dressed all those
dolls for little children I am not acquainted
with at all. Which of them should you like
the very best? Which should you like for
your very own?"</p>

<p>Tibbie could neither make herself move
nor speak; but the tail of her eye travelled
towards the dolls.</p>

<p>"The bride!" Sally took the liberty of
saying, beaming as she came to Tibbie's
aid.</p>

<p>"The bride? Which one is that? That
one? Of course!" Mrs. Darling reached
for the resplendent favorite and placed her
in Tibbie's hands. "There, my dear."</p>

<p>Tibbie took the doll loosely, without
breath of thanks; but while Mrs. Darling reviewed
the dolls, her hand went out involuntarily
towards the broken one. Mrs. Darling
saw it. "Of course," she said&mdash;"of
course, you would want that poor dollie to
nurse back to health. Now, dear, isn't there
<i>one more</i> you would like?"</p>

<p>At this Tibbie's confusion seemed likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
to overwhelm and swamp her. "I'll choose
one for you," said Mrs. Darling, "and you
shall call her Cynthia, after me. How would
you like that? Suppose we say this one,
with the forget-me-nots? She looks a little
like me, doesn't she, with her hair parted in
the middle? Her frock is made of a piece of
one of my own, and that blue is my favorite
color. There, Tibbie, now you have two
whole dollies and part of another. You
must run right home to bed. A Merry
Christmas to you, dear child. I am very
happy to have made your acquaintance."</p>

<p>The exuberant Sally talked like a clock
gone mad all the way home through the
clear wintry night; and since she felt inclined
to conversation, it was well she could
keep one up alone, for Tibbie, who trotted
beside her, holding fast her dolls, did not utter
a single word.</p>

<h2 id="THE_PASSING_OF_SPRING">THE PASSING OF SPRING</h2></div>


<p>In the crowded, unbeautiful part of the
city were two streets forming as if the two
long legs of the A we knew as children, the
A with feet wide apart, that stood for Ape.
A third street went from one to the other, as
the little bar does across the A, but crooked,
as a child's hand would draw it. This street
was narrow, gloomy, and relatively quiet.
The tide of traffic kept to the larger streets;
the small street knew, beyond the occupants
of its own houses and visitors to these, few
but hurried foot-travellers who used it as a
short cut, and people of inferior pretensions
coming there to trade. The ground-story
of almost every house was a shop; a person
might have spent a life without real necessity
for leaving the street. Here boots were made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and mended; in the next door, clothes were
sold (the dim show-windows were full of decent
dresses, very good still for what you
paid; you could be fitted even with a ball-dress,
all beads and satin bows), yonder you
could get money on deposit of your watch,
or your flute, or your ear-drops; farther you
could have yourself shaved. There was a
window full of tarts and loaves; another window
in which a roast fowl set its gold note,
as some would say, between the pink note of
half a ham and the coral note of a lobster.</p>

<p>Across a certain one of the windows in
that street for a long time had hung from a
line, as from the belt of a savage, tails of hair&mdash;black,
brown, blond. Below these, two
featureless wax faces presented their sallow
blankness to the passer, one wreathed with
yellow curls, the other capped with brown
waves of a regular pattern. Ordered around
the twin turned-ebony stands were hairpins,
sticks of cosmetic wrapped in silver paper,
slabs of chalk laid on pink cotton, china pots
with pictures of flowers or beauties and pleasing
inscriptions in French, fuzzy white balls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of down, combs, gilt-brass ornaments, kid-capped
phials containing amber and ruby
liquids. On the inside of the heavy shutter,
caught back against the street-wall by day,
was pasted a large print. This told you in
what a prodigious way Madame Finibald's
Gold Elixir would make your hair grow, and
showed you the picture of a lady who doubtless
had used it&mdash;her hair was extraordinary,
it nearly reached to her feet.</p>

<p>Perhaps it had been found that the neighborhood
was become hardened to the sight
of the luxuriant pictured hair; perhaps some
who had provided themselves with the small
copy of it, to be obtained inside on a bottle
full of brown stuff, had grown inclined to
treat of it lightly: "Ah, Madame Finibald!"
perhaps one irritated customer had said to
the old proprietress, coming to have made
clear to her why after three bottles of Gold
Elixir her locks were still not thick, still not
glossy and splendid as the announcement
promised they should be, "it's easy to cork
up herb tea. It's easy to make hair long in
a picture, and it's easy to make it thick. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
don't believe there ever was any such person
as that young woman on the label!" One
morning saw a change in Madame Finibald's
window. All the accustomed things were
crowded to the sides to make room for a
chair; on this sat a girl with brown-gold hair
that reached in very truth to the floor.</p>

<p>On every morning and every afternoon,
through a long winter, first one end and then
the other of the little street was crossed by
a youth who kept to the larger thoroughfares
with the stream. He carried books; he
went rapidly, granting small attention to the
things he passed. It is not from that to be
supposed that he was profoundly thinking.
His face, agreeable in feature and color, was
rather wanting in expression; no more interesting
than it was interested. He passed
at precisely the same hour every morning,
and the time of his passing in the afternoon
varied but little. This, from October unto
April. But when April set its gold stamp
on the weather, had there been any wise person
observing this well&mdash;constructed blond
machine, applauding its regularity, holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
it up perhaps as an example to other young
frequenters of schools and lecture-rooms&mdash;that
wise person would have been troubled,
he would have had misgivings, he would
have been at last full of grief.</p>

<p>A change had come over the young man's
mood. His eye was acquiring a roving habit.
If his step had before been bent on duty, it was
now less directly bent; if before he had been
on time at his appointments, he must now
have been always more or less late. He
walked leisurely, swinging his books by a
strap. He loitered before shop-windows, he
turned to look after a face. The sky smiled
down between the rows of buildings on the
occasion of the first balmy day; little clouds
floated in it, shimmering like dissolving
pearls. He returned the soft sky's compliment;
he looked up at it, the winter sternness
melting from his eyes. At every street
corner he was seen to stop, foolishly smiling
upward; and, yes, positively, he was seen
there, forgetful of all the people, to sigh and
stretch! On that very day he lost three
books out of his strap, and did not for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
time notice it; when he did, he cared nothing!
From a scrawl on the fly-leaf the finder
of these books learned their rightful owner
to be of the house of Fraisier.</p>

<p>He had come hundreds of miles from an
obscure town to study in this great city; he
had been a serious, mechanical plodder for
months, feeling that he owed it to himself
and to his distant family to fill his head full,
full with precious notions. He had formed
no friendships with his fellow-students, fearing
that they would divert him, or perhaps,
fearing the young fellows themselves, among
whom he felt singularly green. He lived
alone in one little room at the end of the
world, took no holidays, had no fun, went to
bed early so as to be fresh for his book in
the morning. And now, suddenly, he had
completely lost the point of view from which
it had seemed necessary that he should get
dizzily high marks, that he should conquer
field after field in the realm of learning, and
return to his home exuding glory. He could
not persuade himself any more but that it
befitted him perfectly to spend many hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
strolling through the streets with his hands
in his pockets, amusing his eyes with sights
of every sort. He could find no argument
that satisfied him why he should not lounge
on a garden seat warm with sun, smoking
cigarettes half the day, thinking nothing
profitable. The wretched boy had lost all
sober sense of the duty of man.</p>

<p>If he had limited himself to sitting idle in
the garden, watching the year develop in that
narrow, charming enclosure, one might have
found an excuse for him, the same as for the
scientist who studies a specimen under a
glass; or, one might have said he had been
overworking, his new circumstances on coming
to the city had induced in him a false
sort of fervor for work&mdash;a reaction was to
be expected. But the mood whose first
stage had been simple disinclination for study
and a taste for pointless wanderings, by the
time that in the march of the year the crocuses
had gone, took on developments. It
was not so often before a many-colored
flower-bed he stopped, as before a window
full of hats and bonnets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>If, again, he had limited himself to staring
in at milliners' fronts! The wares there do
somewhat resemble fantastic flowers, and
might explain the interest of a botanist.
But he halted in the same way before shops
that offered no excuse for the same attention;
windows in which were only idle feminine
frocks displayed, flippant fans, frills of fluted
lace, feathery things for the neck.</p>

<p>One might have imagined from his wonder
and interest that all these things had just
been invented, that they were a strange
spring-crop; that new, too, was the race of
smiling, chatting, shopping beings crowding
the street on sunny days, new and in fashion
only since this spring, such unaccustomed
pleasure spoke in his eye that shyly followed
them in their prettiest representatives. What
exquisite sense shown, O ever-young Creator,
in making the lip red, and the neck white,
and the temperate cheek between white and
red!</p>

<p>The boy had moments of being drunk in a
glorified way even as is the innocent bee,
with nothing but wandering among flowers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Owing to a confusion in the ideas attendant
on that mysterious soft travailing among the
atoms of the heart warmed through by spring,
all sorts of things to him were as flowers!
His imagination was so increased in power,
that with nothing but a pair of little shoes in
a show-case to start from he could build up
the most astonishing, dreamy stories: he
could set feet in the shoes and rear a palatial
flesh-and-blood structure over them, as easy
as sigh; fit the whole with graces, laces, circumstances
and adventures&mdash;contrive even
to tangle its fate pleasingly with his own.</p>

<p>Which may make supposed that he was a
youth of some boldness. Far from it. He
scarcely knew what a woman's eyes were like,
except in profile or fugitive three-quarters;
on the other hand, he was well acquainted
with her back hair. Hair, in which he could
pursue long studies unconfounded, seemed
to him the most beautiful thing in all the
world.</p>

<p>One day, with a view to lengthening the
way by taking a road that though shorter
must from novelty be richer in diversion than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
his daily track, he turned into the little street
that cut off the triangle of the A. He paused
before the window of the worn watches and
sleeve-links; he took his time over the faded
finery of the second-hand clothes shop; he
examined certain yellowed wood-cuts and
stained books he found in a narrow open
stall. As he seemed coming to the end of
the street's resources, he looked over the way
and thoughtfully felt his cheek: he could not
find there what would have justified a refreshing
station at the barber's. He continued
his way slowly, to make it last. Now, he
stopped where several others were likewise
stopping&mdash;he had come to Madame Finibald's.</p>

<p>The girl sat amid her hair, either unconscious
or disdainful of the eyes watching her
beyond the glass. She looked in a book
open on her lap; now and then she turned
over a leaf, sometimes revealing a picture on
the page. Her chair was low, perhaps so
that her hair should amply trail; its lowness
made an excuse for the listlessness of her
posture; her feet were outstretched and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
crossed, the passers might know that one of
her shoes was laced with pink twine. If she
moved her eyes from her book a moment, it
was only to sweep them past the faces, unseeing,
and lift them to the strip of sky between
the houses&mdash;so blue this day, the little bit
there was of it.</p>

<p>Her face one scarcely noticed for the first
moment more than any rosy apple; for oh!
her hair!&mdash;her hair claimed all the attention
a man had to give, did her shining hair falling
stately along her cheeks, all over her shoulders,
below her waist, beyond her garment&mdash;richer,
of course, than any possible queen's
cloak. The light rippled over it, changing
on it all the time, when nothing else in the
window appeared to live.</p>

<p>Within the shadow of the shop was discerned
a watchful, wrinkled old face, chiefly
differing from a parrot's in the slyness of its
eyes. Fraisier catching sight of it thought
of a witch on guard over a princess enchanted
and imprisoned in a glass-case.</p>

<p>The little group in front of Madame Finibald's
dispersed, formed anew with other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
faces many times in the hour; Fraisier remained,
his eyes climbing up, sliding down
the golden ropes of hair.</p>

<p>At last, though the girl gave no sign, he
was made uncomfortable by the sense that
she must, even without looking, have seen
how long he stood. He inquired timidly
of her face. It was informed with a gentle
brazenness, fortified to be stared at all the
day. Yet there was a suggestion of childishness
in its abstracted expression; she
wore the sort of look one has seen on the
face of a little girl playing at being somebody
else far more splendid than herself.
A close observer might have suspected that
she really thought it rather grand to sit there
in the gorgeousness of her hair, and was
amused with pretending not to know that a
soul looked on.</p>

<p>Fraisier, because her eyes were lowered,
found hardihood to stare his fill at her face.
He surrendered without struggle before the
round cheeks, the short little nose, the good-natured
mouth and chin, which, in truth, took
more than their just space in the face. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
most&mdash;oh, still most! delighted him the
brown-gold hair that tumbled over her forehead
and ears in little curls.</p>

<p>He was realizing from the mutterings of
what was left him of a conscience how late
it must be getting&mdash;he must be taking himself
off; he was making long the one minute
more he allowed himself, when her pupils slid
between the lashes in his direction. He had
lost all presence of mind, he could not withdraw
his glance. After a second's pause
upon his, her eyes slid back to her book and
were hidden. Then, without another thought
towards duty, he crossed the street to the
barber's, from whose window he could see
Madame Finibald's; and, coming forth with
a smoother face than the rose, entered the
little eating-shop next door, from which likewise
he could command Madame Finibald's.</p>

<p>He went through the little street every day.
He took many atrocious meals in the shop,
on the table nearest the window.</p>

<p>On such days as brought perfect weather,
the girl in Madame Finibald's would turn
very often to the sky a look easily inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>preted
as longing. Then would Fraisier
look up too and sigh. It seemed such a
pity, this wasted blue weather.</p>

<p>It seemed such a pity, all this wasted
sweetness, he thought in crossing a public
garden on his occasional unwilling way to a
lecture. The quince-tree blossomed in red;
under the cherry were little drifts of scented
snow; up out of the vigorous, rested earth
were flowers springing in mad, gay multitudes.
The air was silver made air in the
morning; and in the afternoon it was gold
made air. Birds, busily building, busily twittered.
These things did nothing to him, but
the more they were lovely and penetrated the
heart, the more to make him lonesome.</p>

<p>He took himself away from their radiance
without one regret for them, to spend his
time in preference in an ugly little street
where one could scarcely have known what
season it was, where there was nothing to see
that was beautiful but certain long, long hair.
In thought, though, let it be said in vindication
of spring's power of enthralling, having
done up the hair in braids, and extinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
it with a hat, he was always, always guiding
it to the contemned garden. When once it
was in the garden, May there had become
perfect.</p>

<p>He wondered whether it could be she had
become aware of his persistent presence. He
feared she had, and as often that she had not.
He imagined sometimes that when he looked
her face was quivering with a conquered
desire to smile. That disconcerted him a
shade. Sometimes he thought she looked
suspiciously rosy for a girl unconscious of all
the world. Sometimes he looked away, with
the idea that if he turned suddenly he should
find her stealing a glance at him. But he
dared not look very quickly, lest the action
should be too marked; and turning with discreet
alacrity, he could never feel sure.</p>

<p>One day, at last, having settled in his mind
that this tame conduct was unworthy of a
man, refusing himself a second in which to
think better of any matter, he crossed the
street and charged the shop. A bell snapped
sharply as he opened the door. It startled
him to the point of gasping. He grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
crimson, finding himself opposed in truth, as
many a night before in dream, by Madame
Finibald's sly and lowly smile, breathing the
same faintly drug-perfumed air as the princess
breathed, no glass screen between himself
and the hair. He could have touched it,
had he been so bold.</p>

<p>He stammered a request for soap&mdash;scented
soap. He wished himself tens of ten miles
away, or time out of mind dead, when&mdash;wonderful!
The maiden in the window
looked frankly over her shoulder. Was it
that her eyes brimmed with friendly laughter,
or did it seem so to him because his head
had become incapable of a true notion?
His heart, so to speak, found its feet; he
made a muddle of every sentence he launched
upon, but his words had a voice behind them.
So much he contrived to convey: he was
very hard to please in the matter of soap. He
sniffed at a variety of proffered tablets, whose
virtues Madame Finibald, in very truth like
a witch with a philter to sell, assiduously set
forth; each cake he examined seemed to
hold in her estimation just a little higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
place than the foregoing. At the end of ten
minutes, without positively losing her good-humor,
she declared that he had seen all in
the shop, she was sorry and surprised they
could not suit him, they might have a fresh
stock in on the morrow. He was leaving in
clumsy embarrassment, empty handed, with
a promise to return, when the princess
lightly jumped from the window-place, and,
sweeping the hair off her face, said: "There
is one more sort, ma'am. I saw it up there,
high, when I dusted. Let me get it."</p>

<p>She fetched the steps, and in a moment
had climbed and lifted down a box. She
set it on the counter; she opened it herself
and held towards him, with a direct glance,
a packet with a red rose printed on the
wrapper.</p>

<p>Madame Finibald, with an exclamation,
snatched it from the girl's hand, and began,
as if here had been a little grandchild recovered
to her old age, to speak with tenderness
of its merits. The girl stood near, twining
and untwining a lock around her finger,
while she unaffectedly looked at the cus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>tomer.
Her hair came below her knees;
every moment she had to toss it back out of
her face.</p>

<p>"Go back to your window, wicked child!"
cried the old witch, suddenly, as if catching
at a piece of gold as it was being taken out
of her pocket. "Go back!"</p>

<p>"I am tired of sitting!" said the little
princess, twisting her shoulders in her frock
with the prettiest peevishness. "I have sat
and sat and sat! I have finished my story.
Let me go out and get a bun. You know
you said I could when it was noon."</p>

<p>She caught at her hair, and, to the infinite
wonder of one looking on, began twisting,
twisting, twisting, coiling, coiling, coiling,
driving in great skewers&mdash;while he filled his
blissful pockets with rose-scented soap.</p>

<p>The bell snapped in fretful reprehension
for her passing out. Less than a minute
after, it exclaimed in annoyed surprise for
his.</p>

<p>Now was he no longer made lonesome by
every coquettish touch the more that the
year put to her toilet. For the girl of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
regal hair smiled to him, surreptitiously with
her lips, but unguardedly with her eyes, when
he came by her glass-case; while he dawdled
in the window opposite, she communicated
with him by signs no other eye could have
perceived. Even before their acquaintance
had become very old, she slipped out to walk
in the garden, and they sat on the green seats
and had long, foolish, youthful talks&mdash;delightful,
foolish, youthful times.</p>

<p>Her conversation took an amusing interest
from the peculiarities of her education. She
had seen and heard much in her short life in
a hard world, where it was no one's affair to
keep anything from her young ken&mdash;much of
dark, and petty, and unpicturesque&mdash;preserving
through all a sort of hardy innocence;
and she had borrowed from a cheap circulating
library a vast lot of fiction dealing with
the supremely grand. Her preference in
literature, however, had remained for fairy
tales, a taste formed when it had been one
of her duties to read aloud to certain little
children of the rich. She knew them by the
score. It was to this, perhaps, some of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
remarks owed the fanciful touch that redeemed
them from the commonness of her
general conversation&mdash;a genial commonness,
condoned to such young lips. She had a
childish way of lending a personality to
everything, that amused him more than
epigram would have done. She ascribed
intention to the wind that blew off her hat,
and stopped to express her mind to it. She
assumed consciousness in the bench they sat
on; she wanted to take the same one, lest it
should think they slighted it because it was
rickety, for which it was not to blame. Every
flower was to her a person. "Hush!
They are listening!" she said, looking from
the corner of her eye at a bank of knowing
pansies. She scolded a button for coming
off, as if the want of principle shown
by it had been a thing to revolt her. She
stood in a one-sided relation of good-fellowship
with the brown birds hopping
among the gravel, and the fishes in the
pond; she spared them many crumbs. With
homely good-heartedness she took into an
amused regard all the family of spring&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>buds,
blades, insects&mdash;addressing speech to
them as if she had been a giant and they a
very little people.</p>

<p>Never can spring return without Fraisier's
remembering that spring. It was bright; by
it all the springs following have been cast in
the shadow.</p>

<p>The long hair was woven through and
through his thoughts; but not as a disturbing,
upheaving element. The girl made him
waste a great deal of time, but nothing else&mdash;not
the life of his heart. Because of her
good-nature, her entire want of coquetry or
perverseness, his feeling for her complicated
itself in nowise; rather it grew simpler as it
insensibly changed. His wonder and fine
dread at feminine appurtenances had worn
away a little with increased familiarity; he
reposed on that fact as if it had been such
an one as becoming accustomed to the noise
of guns. He felt under delicate obligations
to her for having routed his shyness, and not
at all tormented him in any of the thousand
ways he apprehended a feminine being would
have at her command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>As he was less and less in awe of her and
that suspected arsenal, though a charming,
fearful element went out of his sentiment,
his affection perhaps grew more. She made
such a good little comrade! Insidiously,
she connected herself in his mind with future
days&mdash;she who cared only for the day and
the pleasure thereof. When he spoke of a
thing it would be pleasant to do, a place
pleasant to visit, he said, always unreflectingly,
yet from a sincere heart: "Some day
we must go there. Let us do such a thing
some time." When he described the hills
and ponds of home, he said what they might
have done had she been there last summer
or the years before, how they might have
rowed and rambled. He painted the good
time they might have together, in some not
impossible, but not specified time, place, and
circumstances.</p>

<p>So the green from tender grew brilliant&mdash;grew
deep&mdash;became void of interest to the
accustomed eye, and more or less dust settled
over it. It was manifest to all that spring
was past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Then began an anxious time. Those
lectures, those miserable lectures! Those
courses, those wretched courses, which he
had neglected! That blessed information
he had spared to cull when the time was for
it! These things seemed likely to get their
revenge. When he awoke to a sense of his
danger&mdash;very late! only when the bloom
was off the year, when lily and early rose
had gone where they could divert no mortal
more&mdash;he could not believe that he should
not, by fitting exertion, catch up in time at
the appointed goal. He worked rabidly,
with a wet cloth around his head. He
thought not of girls in those days, I promise
you; he recked not of bronze-gold hair!</p>

<p>It was written that he should not be
saved. He closed his school term pitiably
conditioned.</p>

<p>When the worst was known, at least was
time to breathe, however sore the lungs,
then his mind reverted to her. He had
been man enough to harbor no spite towards
her, accuse her of nothing. He sent her a
message and waited at the appointed place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
wondering a little, while he waited, at his
follies of the spring. They seemed so unnecessary,
looked back upon now. Why,
in a very real, practical world like this one,
where a man's failure to pass his exams was
sure to call forth from his progenitor letters
such as his pocket at this moment contained,
conduct one's self as if existing in a world
of lambs and purling streams and shepherdesses?
He was one with the actual world in
looking with astonishment and condemnation
upon his own works. The sky above
was hard, barren blue; it seemed so easy,
looking back, to have stuck to the approved
road. What had possessed him?</p>

<p>Then she appeared. At sight of her his
heart dropped its armor. She brought back
a whiff of the sweetness of a past atmosphere.
Was it possible he had ever been the happy
boy he seemed to remember! He smiled up
in her face with cheek-muscles stiffened by
disuse, and eyes ringed with studious shadows.
She had on a flimsy frock, printed all over
with little flowers that seemed to him to
smell good; her hair, where the great wad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
projected beyond the straw brim, was touched
with a warm, peculiar glory. He had meant
to keep himself well hardened against her,
tell her the various things necessary in a
matter-of-fact way, and bid her good-bye
indefinitely. He felt more like crying with
his disgraced head in her lap.</p>

<p>He conquered his weakness.... A pretty
man he made!</p>

<p>He got out with sufficient composure and
dignity what he had to say. He told her all
that had happened, the change it made in
the coming months. He was not going
home for the holidays; he could not endure
to see the folks. He was going into the
country to spend the summer in hard study,
to make sure of "passing" next term. He
was going to the particular place he mentioned
because he had a friend there, a fellow
he had taken up with in the last weeks, one
that had had the same bad luck as himself.
This man's family lived there; it would not
be quite so dreary as being alone.</p>

<p>She chaffed and consoled him in turns.
Now that the world had gone all wrong with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
him, her eyes seemed to him sweeter and
softer than he had ever observed. What a
good, kind little friend! Lord! what a good,
crazy, light-hearted time they had had, and
how pretty she looked to-day! What wonderful,
thrice wonderful hair it was, waving
and ringletting about her glowing summer
face, coiling massively on the back of her
head! No woman on earth had such hair!</p>

<p>He did wish for a moment that Green, his
new friend, might see her&mdash;he was proud of
her. One night, when they had sat grinding
together for mutual assistance, the oil giving
out, Green had told him of a cousin of his.
Fraisier had said nothing of any girl. He
only wished that Green might see the hair
of this girl whose name he had foreborne to
speak.</p>

<p>Good-bye, Minnie! He should be working
like a slave all through the burning golden
days&mdash;let her think of him a little. He
should be very lonesome. When he had
studied until his eyes smarted and his head
swam, there would be nothing pleasant to
do, no one pleasant to talk with&mdash;she might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
spare a moment to be sorry for him now
and then. He should be back in the fall.
Bless the beautiful and beautiful and beautiful
hair! Good-bye, Minnie!</p>

<p>She so little perished from his mind after
their parting that whenever&mdash;as Green and
he lay under the trees, withdrawn from the
world and devoted to arduous studies, keeping
off the insects by smoke&mdash;Green began
talking about that cousin of his, Fraisier
became half sick with reminiscence. He
could not resist replying by talking&mdash;with
the finest, shyest reverence always&mdash;of Minnie.
There was a dreamy solace in talking
of her to some one. She described so well,
too; so unusually. He had a proud secret
assurance that as an incident in a man's life
she altogether eclipsed a cousin in interest.</p>

<p>"How long is your cousin's hair?" he
asked, with assumed casualness, once. Green
stared a little, and confessed not having the
slightest idea. Fraisier opened his arms as
wide as they could go, and said, vaguely
blushing, "The young lady I spoke of has
hair as long as this!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come! I should like to see it!" spoke
Green, in such a tone that Fraisier turned a
deep, vexed red.</p>

<p>He said nothing, but on the next day took
his books to a different place, choosing to
keep to himself so long as Green did not seek
him with a suitable apology.</p>

<p>The spot selected by the young men as a
meeting ground lay at an equal distance
between Green's home and the cottage in
which Fraisier had taken up his summer
quarters. It was on the skirts of a wood,
and, by some accident of the land, often cool
when other places were hot. The rolling
pasture it commanded was dotted with
scrubby evergreens, and crossed by a small
brook the cow's hoofs had in some places
trodden broad and shallow. It was colored
in patches with the frequent pink of clover-heads,
surprised here and there with the
white of a long-necked, belated daisy.</p>

<p>Fraisier took himself to a spot just not so
far from the usual haunt but that Green
when he came might see him.</p>

<p>It was a fair, soft, simmering morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
promising a scorching day. He stretched
himself under the trees and lighted a pipe&mdash;he
had taken to a pipe in place of cigarettes since
coming into the wilderness. He composed
himself for a serious forenoon's work, deciding
that it was much more profitable, after all, to
study alone&mdash;Green was always digressing.</p>

<p>The spot he had chosen was not so good,
it proved, as the one he had left clear for
Green. A path ran through the woods, just
within the trees; there was a frequent patter
of bare feet on the dust, children with pails
passed looking for things. He waited to
proceed with his theorem till their high
piping, scattered voices had died away. It
was not so cool, either; as a fact, it was
hotter than most places. He did not crave
the exertion of seeking a better; this was at
least shady. He turned over on his back
and closed his eyes, yielding gracefully to
the force of circumstances.</p>

<p>A light blow in the face, from an acorn,
perhaps, roused him. He thought of Green,
and, instantly broad awake, looked for the
development of some practical joke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not Green&mdash;he saw it with a sort of
disappointment. It was one of the berry-seeking
children that had caught sight of him
snoozing, and followed its natural instinct.
A boy's grinning head was seen bobbing
above one of the neighboring bushes. He
turned from it in disgust and felt surlily
about the grass for his pipe, about his person
for a match&mdash;</p>

<p>Gracious powers! what sort did the young
one take him for, with this free persecution?
Another acorn had hit him smartly on the
head.</p>

<p>"Look out, there!" he called, making a
feint of rising to give chase.</p>

<p>"Come on!" shouted the boy, gayly, from
behind the bush. There was a burst of
laughter, a flash and flutter of pink, and the
boy, who turned out to be a girl, came precipitately
towards him. She stopped just
short of a collision, and dropped in the grass
panting with laughter. He stared at her
blankly. Every time she looked up and
caught sight of his expression she doubled
herself and fairly writhed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"He doesn't know me!&mdash;he doesn't know
me!" she brought forth amid her convulsive
giggling.</p>

<p>"Minnie! My God! What&mdash;what have
you done to yourself?" he exclaimed, and
had no breath left.</p>

<p>She moderated her laughter, and presented
her smiling face a moment for him to see
well what had happened. She ran her fingers
over her cropped head, ruffling it absurdly,
making the short locks stand on end.</p>

<p>"Isn't it funny? Doesn't a person look
funny at first? The rest of it is hanging,
like a fairy horse's tail, in the window, across
the picture of the Elixir lady. (Bad old
woman! Cheat! She didn't give me much
for it! But, Natty Fraisier, I would have
taken even less, I did want to come so!)
You poor, lonesome boy! I can stay a whole
week&mdash;perhaps more. I have found a place
in the village, just near you. The first child
I met told me all I wanted to know. I
thought it would have been harder. Mercy!
isn't it heavenly still and sweet here, with
hills and cows? I was never in the true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
country before. Mercy! isn't it good? Look
out, you flower there&mdash;over there, you, miss!
That is called a bee; he has a terrible stinger&mdash;oh,
he is an old acquaintance? Go ahead,
then, and give him a nice swing, and honey
for his tea. Oh, Natty, I am so glad! Aren't
you glad?"</p>

<p>He choked and cleared his throat. No,
without that voice, never in the world would
he have known her. Before him seemed to
be a common little street-boy who had run
off in a girl's new pink dress and shiny shoes&mdash;an
unknown boy whose features had something
painfully familiar. Strange! He remembered
Minnie's face as possessing a certain
harmony in its lines, however childish
and trivial they were; this terrible little impostor,
though not ill favored, was broad of
jaw and narrow of forehead; his eyes even
were not the same, but smaller and nearer
together, while the mouth was larger&mdash;its
very proneness to laughter increased its commonness.
And that ridiculous hair&mdash;literally
chopped off by an unskilled hand and twisted
here and there with unpractised tongs! It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
was so thick, it had no more light or lustre
than a hearth-brush.</p>

<p>Her face sobered ever so little as she looked
at him. "What is the matter? Poor dear!
you haven't got over those exams. But I
won't bother, you know, and take up all your
time; I have learned better. I won't interfere
with any work, I promise, Natty. See me
swear? On this algebra! Only, before you
begin and when you have done each day, we
will go for walks and rows. I saw a boat on
the pond. We will have lunch on the grass,
and make a fire with sticks we pick up.
Look! you put three long sticks like that
and hang the kettle in the middle. We will
do all those things we used to plan when we
never much thought there would be a chance.
You poor, lonesome boy, have you been having
a horrid time? We will make up for it
now. Natty, you don't care about the <i>hair</i>,
do you? You needn't. You know, I had
got mortally sick of sitting in that window.
I could not have stood it a day longer.
When a fly buzzed on the pane I wanted to
scream. Again and again I have come near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
putting my foot through the glass at one of
the gaping faces, then jumping down and
catching the old woman while she told lies
about my having used her Elixir faithfully&mdash;never
touched a drop!&mdash;and dancing her
up and down all around the room until she
dropped. I shall go back to taking care of
little children now, as I did before she found
me. I do love children! And in that business,
I don't mind telling you, I shall do
better without all that hair. No matter how
tight I did it up, some one was always grumbling
that it made too much show. You
mustn't care a bit about the hair, Natty; I
gave it up without a twinge. I cut it off
with my own hands. You have no idea
how much comfortabler this is in hot weather.
My head feels so light! I can dip it in
the water any minute. I do love it like
this!"</p>

<p>She ran her hands through her hair again,
ruffling it still more fantastically. Fraisier
winced. He was sick beyond calculating
the degree. "Oh, my poor girl!" he contrived
at last to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked at him more closely than before
in her overrunning joy, and her face
fell a little. No doubt she had seen herself
in mirrors since her alteration, but not in a
real mirror until she saw herself reflected in
his very pale face. She smiled still, but a
little foolishly; then no more, and stopped
chatting. It was as if a stone had been set
to seal up a spring&mdash;a large stone laid upon
her bubbling heart. There was a silence.</p>

<p>He saw that she must be seeing what he
could not keep out of his face. He could
not help it; he could get no control over his
feelings, over his expression. He was not
sure he cared to&mdash;he did not try. He was
at sea: he did not know what he felt, what
he did not feel. The bottom seemed to
have dropped out of his heart, out of the
world&mdash;out of something, everything. He
knew not! He only knew he was sick&mdash;sick,
and incapable of speech, of action, of
reflection.</p>

<p>"You can't stay here, child," he heard
some one saying, in a matter-of-fact, superficial
voice. "Don't you see, yourself, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
you can't? For your own sake, I mean. It
would never do, Minnie. You must understand
that. You don't know what a thing
a small country village like this is, for gossip
and slanderous tongues. I couldn't let you
injure yourself so, don't you see?"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be proper?" she inquired,
faintly.</p>

<p>"No, Minnie; no, it wouldn't&mdash;at all.
Don't you see it?"</p>

<p>She got to her feet, full as pale as he now.</p>

<p>"All right," she said, and after a few mechanical
steps, paused a moment, looking
down, biting her finger&mdash;lost in thought, or
waiting for something to happen, for him
to say something further.</p>

<p>He could not speak&mdash;he could not make
himself speak.</p>

<p>"All right," she said again, very distinctly,
and turned to go without another word.</p>

<p>"Minnie! Minnie!" he faltered, and had
instinctively cast himself after her. His
outstretched hand almost touched her pink
draperies. She turned on him fiercely, whisking
herself out of reach. He was confront<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>ed
for a second by a little angry street-boy
face, but with the gathered experience and
woe of half a race in the eyes. "Let me
alone! Don't dare to touch me! Nathaniel
Fraisier, I hate you!"</p>

<p>She began desperately to run. He saw
her clutch her poor little ruined head, and
heard her cry out, breaking into sobs: "Oh,
my hair! Oh, my hair!"</p>

<p>He dropped in the grass, face downward,
and pressed his hands over his ears, trembling.
It all seemed so strange, so out of
proportion.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon of that same hot
day the crabbed little bell on Madame Finibald's
door snapped to let in a tired, dusty
youth, whose dejected face was so flushed,
one's thought at sight of him turned at once
on sunstroke. He leaned wearily over the
counter and asked a few questions, at which
madame's liver seemed so shaken she could
not keep a hold on her good manners. At
the height of her voice she began berating
all the world, and one absent person. Fraisier
tried to calm her, with vague, soothing mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>tions
of his hands patting down the air.
When she subsided enough for him to be
heard, he pointed to a long tail of shining
hair in the window, and spoke again, growing
redder, if possible, than before&mdash;so red
that his eyes watered, and he had to shade
them a moment, leaning his elbows on the
counter. She unhitched the hair, shaking it
brutally. He put out his hands in remonstrance.
She flung it down before him with
a forbidding proposition and a deep snort of
malice. Meekly he emptied his purse on
the counter, unfolding the bills, spreading
out the silver and lucky pieces to count, reserving
only for himself a crumpled ticket.</p>

<p>She watched him with gleeful, avaricious
eyes. After computation, he rose without
breath of argument and went down the
street to pawn his watch and studs and
cigarette-case, returning solvent.</p>

<p>He left with a rather unsightly parcel in
his hand; the cover was burst in more than
one place. Madame Finibald had not been
so particular as she sometimes was in the
selection of her wrapping-paper. He had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
overcoat and no pocket large enough to put
his prize in; he was forced to hold it, conscious
how it was heavy and soft and its
contents gleamed through the holes.</p>

<p>He got home at dark, reporting to his
landlady with his back to the light. He
wanted nothing to eat: there were lamps
and voices in the dining-room. He could
not go to bed, worn out as he was: on the
porch below his window was singing and
picking of strings.</p>

<p>He went forth into the fields. At last,
beyond all sounds but the summer's own,
he sank on the grass. He did not look up
once at the stars, but lay sprawling with his
forehead on his crossed arms, and let his
heart torture itself at its own good leisure.
He drank deeper and deeper of its dark
bitterness, forcing himself recklessly to it,
reaching a sort of desperate drunkenness.
It seemed to his inexperience there could
be nothing worse at any time in this life
to taste.</p>

<p>He woke long hours afterwards, wondering
a little at first, feeling somewhat stiff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
The air was warm and still, tremulous with
crickets&mdash;thrilled through with the shaken
baubles of the summer's myriad little jesters.
In his sleep he had rolled over; his
face was to heaven. The sky was faint with
starlight; the Milky Way was a road of diamond
sand; the great constellations had
hung themselves with solemn jewels; down
near the rim of the world watched far-spaced
large earnest beacon-lights&mdash;but above, the
tiniest irresponsible stars twinkled in and out,
like shining ants in ant-hills. He looked,
almost wondering why his eyes felt so queer&mdash;sore
besides heavy; why his breast felt so
heavy. He rose sitting; he was on a hillock.
Like an opaque reproduction of the transparent,
lightsome sky looked the ground
about him, which the scythe had this season
respected; it was dark dotted with
daisies. He rubbed his aching head a little,
then lay back again, the grass shooting
coolly up along his cheeks. After the sound,
dreamless sleep of utter exhaustion from
which he had waked, because he had drained
it to satisfaction, his head was numbed, but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the little it worked, clear in its working; his
heart was sore, but quieted. Something had
changed; all wore another aspect; all seemed
farther removed. Hours had gone by already,
a month would go&mdash;a year&mdash;fifteen
years. This would be lived out of memory.
If it is realized that a thing must cease, has
it not begun to die already? At the first
one must be patient, and take suffering as
a matter of course. He stretched his limbs
wearily, not entirely deceived by himself,
nor unaware of depths of heartache under
this film of philosophy that had scummed
them over in sleep. He drew his hot palms
over the grass; his hand came upon the
parcel that he had not dared to leave behind
nor to open, that he never would have the
strength to open&mdash;and his philosophy was
severely shaken. His heart was near bursting
out afresh; he laid his face on the
wretched, soft, dead little bundle, and agonized.</p>

<p>Then he revolted against this suffering
that seemed to him undeserved, disproportionate.
He was not a bad fellow; looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
into his heart, he could declare truthfully
that it was not in him to willingly harm anything&mdash;give
any one pain. Why should he
feel so endlessly mean, so endlessly miserable?
He appealed to Minnie, his reasonable
Minnie of old, against this state of things.
He defended himself to her; she defended
him to himself. When all was said, he had
at no time done anything to blame, had that
day said nothing that was not wise and for
the best, that he would not in like case be
forced to say over again. He had been
taken unawares; he had not expressed himself
with tact&mdash;he had been fatally slow.
The fact remained that the girl could not
have stayed by him, setting the whole country-side
agog. But if his heart still refused
to be at peace about this matter, let it be
assured he meant to seek till he found the
girl; it must be easy enough to find her,
though he had failed that day. Alas! poor
little forlorn head, shorn of its great gleaming
beauty&mdash;poor little discrowned head, at
this hour full of what thoughts, God knew!
He would make all things right to her; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
was extravagantly ready to pay any price;
he was lavish of his future, free of all the
gods gave him to give. At the same time
that he made these protestations to himself
and to her, and he was sincere in making
them, he knew that Minnie would never
look at him again&mdash;he knew that she had
understood how he was changed with the
change in her; it was beyond his governing,
but she must be forgiven for not forgiving
it. And looking into his man's heart, he
wondered at the mystery of it.</p>

<p>In that hour of being honest, after revolting
at it, reasoning about it, trying to sophisticate
it away, he came back always to a
hopeless contemplation of it as a simple fact,
not to be done away with. In the face of it
he might clear himself of all blame, perhaps,
but he remained humiliated and full of a
vague pity. As he lay in the grass so,
plucking heedlessly in the dark at the little
tufts, emptied of all pride under the
lofty stars, a dreamy mood followed upon
what degree of success he had in suppressing
feelings he was determined not to en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>dure,
so did they hurt! His thoughts in
search of soothing travelled back to days
before last spring, when he could hardly
have conceived what he had this night been
suffering. Peaceful period, but without great
charm, he decided, loyal to his altered taste.
He thought of the past spring, the soft
awakening all without and within a man&mdash;the
tender, vast burgeoning, fluttering, shimmering,
outreaching! He judged it sadly
from a midsummer night. Not all were
flowers that put forth in that mad amenity
of nature; no, not all flowers.</p>

<p>And in connection with all that freshness
and fragrance and beauty of spring,
he thought unavoidably of what had seemed
to his new-quickened heart its very expression,
its chiefest adornment&mdash;the gentle
order he loved in so general and devoted a
way. His conjuring head filled with charming
phantoms, pathetic to his sense at this
juncture; they passed, exquisite pageant,
leaving as if a perfume of themselves through
the halls of his mind, not one little grace,
one foolish trick, one dainty manner of be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>ing,
lost on his worshipping sensibility: silver
laughter&mdash;odors of violets&mdash;sunny loose
hairs and white hand tucking them behind
the ear&mdash;pretty feet tiptoeing across the street
in bad weather&mdash;pouted lips cooing to a baby,
or quaintly attempting its own language to a
bird&mdash;languid attitudes&mdash;belts of a span&mdash;caprices&mdash;teasing
humors&mdash;tenderness&mdash;pity for
small creatures&mdash;long lashes blinking a tear&mdash;queenly
bearing&mdash;rods of lily held over bowing
heads with such assurance of power as
never a sceptre&mdash;aye, power greater than
any emperor's, founded, dear God&mdash;upon
what? at the mercy&mdash;of what? And he
yearned and grieved over them, poor youth,
as if he had been their maker.</p>

<h2 id="PAULA_IN_ITALY">PAULA IN ITALY</h2></div>


<p>On his way down-stairs Prospero came
upon the <i>padrona di casa</i>.</p>

<p>She stood at the door of the first floor,
which he had supposed untenanted, the windows
on the street being always dark. She
looked pleased, anxious, and full of business.</p>

<p>"Just step in for a moment, signorino,"
she said, "and tell me what it seems to
you."</p>

<p>The young man followed her. The windows
of the apartment were wide open&mdash;most
likely to let in the heat, for to lean
forth beyond the chill boundary of the
stone walls was like dipping into a warm
bath. The long, old, neatly darned lace
curtains waved gently in the April air.
The stone floors had been sprinkled; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
pleasant freshness arose from them. Everything
had an air of having just been gone
over with a damp dust-cloth; everything
that could be furbished shone to the utmost
of its capacity.</p>

<p>The little woman led Prospero into the
large <i>sala</i>, from which, through several open
doors, one got glimpses of other airy chambers.
The great height of the ceiling&mdash;increased
to illusion by the cunning of the
fresco, which professed to open into the sky
itself, and show a flight of rosy cupids tumbling
among the clouds&mdash;had the effect of
dwarfing the furniture, even the gigantic
vases under their shining bells. The seats
were placed about in social groups; in the
embrasure of the balcony window stood a
small table supporting a coral-colored coffee
service, lately placed between two low chairs,
with a view to spreading about suggestions
of cosiness&mdash;the joys of intimate life.</p>

<p>"I see that you are expecting a tenant,"
said Prospero.</p>

<p>"So it is indeed; a great lady&mdash;a foreigner,"
replied the <i>padrona</i>, under her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
breath. "Just see, signorino, what you
make of this name." While she felt in her
pocket she went on: "It is Dottor Segati
sends her to me. Oh, he has sent me
families before when there was a patient
among them; and this apartment has always
given satisfaction; that I can say with my
hand upon my conscience. There&mdash;can you
read it? I can tell the letters, but I can't
make the sound. One ought to have another
tongue on purpose for these foreign
names."</p>

<p>Prospero studied a second, then pronounced,
clearly, "Grfin Paula von Schattenort."</p>

<p>"<i>Grfin</i> means Countess," said the landlady.
"The doctor told me that she is a
Countess; but whether Danish or Swedish
or Hollandish I don't remember. For me
all those countries are the same. Schattenort,
you call it? What would that be in
Italian?"</p>

<p>Prospero laughed. "It stays as it is, dear
lady. Is this Countess young, do you know?"
he went on, looking again at the name on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the paper he still held. "Is she coming here
for her health?"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything beyond the fact
that the doctor engages the rooms for her,
and I can rely upon him. Oh, he has sent
me families before, you know, who have always
been perfectly satisfied with me, and I
with them. You can see yourself that the
quarters are such that even a Countess
might find herself well in them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, truly," replied Prospero, agreeably.
"She would be hard to please if she were
not content. Well, if you allow me now, I
go. Have you perhaps a commission of any
sort for me? I shall do myself a pleasure in
serving you."</p>

<p>"Too good&mdash;much too good. If you
would just say the name over&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Von Schattenort."</p>

<p>"What it is to have a memory! What
a thing is education! Not but that also I
can make myself understood in the French
tongue. Schattenort&mdash;Schattenort. I should
not like to <i>scomparire</i>, you will understand, at
the very first meeting. But if I forget, I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
simply say <i>Signora Contessa</i>. Only one likes
to be able to tell friends whom one has got
in the house."</p>

<p>Prospero, late already, was hurrying down
the stairs, his music under his arm; at the
foot he was forced to stop. He took off his
hat, and leaned against the wall to let the
ladies pass.</p>

<p>The gray-haired gentleman talking unpractised
French he knew to be Dottor
Segati. He fixed upon Paula von Schattenort
without a second's hesitation; of the
two ladies, only the one in the hat and
feather could, in his conception of possibility,
be she. He was half-conscious as she
passed him on her upward way of a faint
pang of disappointment. The name had
suggested to his imagination something tall
and frail, delicate yet imposing, exceedingly,
luminously blond, with eyes of a corn-flower
blue. The magic of the name was defeated.</p>

<p>He bethought him how late he would be,
and without turning his head for a second
look, or giving another thought to the arrivals,
slipped past the two maids, who stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
in the doorway talking in a language unknown
to him, while the Countess's man
handed them bundles from the carriages
drawn up to the door.</p>

<p>Paula, on entering the apartment, let her
little gloved hands drop at her sides, and
looking around with wide, quick eyes, gave
a long sigh of pleasure.</p>

<p>"Here I can breathe&mdash;here I can breathe
indeed!" she said to her companion, in their
Northern tongue; then turning to the doctor,
she assured him in French that she found it
charming, as she had found everything in
Italy&mdash;that she thanked him for his goodness.
The doctor and the landlady both
watched her with a half smile and slightly
raised eyebrows as she walked quickly
through the rooms, exclaiming at every
window with delight at sight of the fawn-colored,
warm-looking river flowing below
and flashing back the sunshine, and the low
hills clothed in their early green.</p>

<p>Her companion followed her with an unusual
solemn dignity of manner, intended
to counterbalance Paula's unaccustomed vi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>vacity,
and give the people of the house, if
possible, an adequate impression of the two
as a whole.</p>

<p>"Oh, look&mdash;look, Cousin Veronika!" exclaimed
the younger woman from the balcony,
over the parapet of which she had
been leaning venturously far&mdash;"look at that
dear old bridge; it is the Jeweller's Bridge;
I recognize it. <i>N'est-ce pas, cher docteur?</i>
Oh, what a sky! But have you any patients
at all in this city, doctor? Is it possible to
be ill here? Do persons die? Of what? I
will never believe it!"</p>

<p>"My dear lady," said the gray doctor, his
kindly face lighting as if with the reflection
of her childish excitement, "will you be advised
by me? Will you sit down on this
commodious divan and rest a little, while
you take what the signora has brought for
you&mdash;this little glass of our white <i>vin santo</i>?
It will do you good. You must be tired,
very tired."</p>

<p>"Oh no! no, doctor! It is like magic. I
do not understand it. I feel like another. I
shall not be tired here, ever. You must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
come and see me every day indeed, but not
as a doctor&mdash;as my good, good friend. Tell
me, is it still standing, the house where
Dante lived? Have you a book&mdash;I mean,
could you advise me a book&mdash;in which there
is everything of the story about him and
Beatrice? It must be sweet to think of
when one is in their city."</p>

<p>"I will do myself the pleasure of sending
you the <i>Vita Nova</i>," he said; then, solicitously,
"but accommodate yourself, my dearest
lady, and drink this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Vita Nova?</i> Does that mean new life?
New life!" she said, as if to herself, suddenly
half stretching her arms up in the air and
smiling in indeterminate happiness at the
ceiling, whereon the shining river cast a restless,
quivering brightness. "Yes, send it
me; I want to read it. I will drink this to
please you, signor, but not that I am tired.
Here is to New Life!"</p>

<p>She touched her glass to the doctor's
and Veronika's, and emptied it at an eager
draught. Veronika watched her in surprised
displeasure, sipping her own wine staidly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
decorously. It warmed her very heart to
see Paula merry, only she thought it unbecoming
to behave in the presence of strangers
as if one were a person of no importance.</p>

<p>Her good-humor returned as soon as the
doctor and the <i>padrona</i> had excused themselves.
When they were alone she seized
Paula unceremoniously by the wrists and
forced her back into an arm-chair; then lifted
her feet, and with much decision placed
them upon a footstool. "Now you don't
stir," she said, shaking her finger in Paula's
face.</p>

<p>"But, cousin, it is so different," pleaded
Paula. "I feel no more as I do at home,
than this mild, heavenly air is like our
joyless atmosphere. Are your eyes open,
Cousin Veronika? Do you perceive the
things about you&mdash;or is it all a dream of my
own? It seemed to me as we drove from
the station that we had arrived in an enchanted
place."</p>

<p>"It's just a city," murmured Veronika.</p>

<p>"Those sombre palaces we passed, how
they make the spring-time in the sky above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
them more lightsome, more warm! And
those flowers banked up for sale against
that black stone wall, could you see what
they were? They seemed to me all new
sorts&mdash;marvellous. Have you noticed how
happy every one looks in Italy, even the
beggars sitting in the sun? And what beautiful
faces one sees&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped and mused, gazing ahead in
silence for a few moments; then went on
aloud: "Yes&mdash;beautiful faces, like pictures.
Did you see the young man whom we met
on the stairs? Not? Veronika, for what
have you eyes? The light just there was a
little dim, but I saw him perfectly. I passed
him slowly on purpose&mdash;he leaned against
the wall to let us go by him. He had wavy
hair, longer than is usual, falling over his
forehead, and soft brown eyes like an animal's.
I am sure one sees such eyes only in
Italy, half asleep, yet deeply intelligent, that
when you look in them you think a thousand
things&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You certainly took in a great deal at a
glance," said Veronika.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I could tell you much else," laughed
Paula; "beside that he wore a pink in
his button-hole and carried a roll of music."</p>

<p>"Veronika," she said, after a pause, jumping
up from her chair and walking about excitedly
as before, "we must be very happy
here. We must begin at once. Think how
much time we have lost&mdash;all our years up
to this day. Now we must really enjoy
ourselves, live&mdash;love!" she added, recklessly,
with light in her eyes.</p>

<p>Veronika, kneeling over an open satchel,
paused in her task to look over her spectacles
with a vaguely shocked air, as if
something immoral had been said.</p>

<p>"This seems like the opening chapter in a
lovely story-book that becomes more interesting
with every page," said Paula, dropping
on her knees and crushing her cheek to
Veronika's gray hair, with an expansiveness
that took this lady aback. "I have the happiest
presentiments! Ah, Veronika, there
was once a woman who said that happiness
is to be young, beloved, and in Italy!"</p>

<p>"Unless you keep quiet and rest," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Veronika, "you will be ill, and that is as far
as <i>you</i> will get&mdash;"</p>

<p>Paula stared a second in wonder at Veronika's
impatience; then she reflected that her
cousin was old and could not understand.
"Poor Veronika!" she thought, with a sympathetic
shake of the head, "<i>she</i> can never
have but Italy!"</p>

<p>Like a good child, she went back to her
chair, but before settling down in it she
pushed it to the balcony window; then she
sat with her eyes fixed upon San Miniato.</p>

<p>Dr. Segati came the next day, early. He
found Paula pale and infinitely tired, but
wearing a contented face. She sat in the
balcony window, closed to-day, with a cushion
behind her shoulders; flowers stood in
the water near her&mdash;a delight to the eyes,
wonderful wind-flowers, white and pink, purple,
scarlet, pale violet. She rose to meet
the doctor, and gave him the childish smile
that had won his heart to her the day before.</p>

<p>She pointed to the book she held. "It
came last night. I thank you. I am trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to read it, you see. But I do not know
enough. I can make only just a little sense
here and there, where it resembles French.
Oh, I like it all the same&mdash;very much. The
title is beautiful&mdash;<i>Vita Nova</i>!"</p>

<p>"Tell her she must not read, doctor," said
Veronika. "It is bad for her. She has been
tiring herself over the book."</p>

<p>The doctor listened politely, an intelligent
eye fixed on Veronika's, and made no objection
to what she said. She had always
after that half an idea that he understood her.</p>

<p>"I had the cook sent in," said Paula, with
a brightening face. "The native cook whom
the <i>padrona</i> was so good as to engage for
me. I asked her about some passages. She
could read them easily&mdash;how I envied her!&mdash;but
she could not make them clear to me,
though she seemed to do her best."</p>

<p>The doctor laughed amusedly, and took a
seat beside her. "What an eager little lady!
Certainly that is the way to learn. But why
this hurry? The great object first is to become
robust. Oh, this air will do it! I have
no fear. And how did you sleep?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Paula blushed as if caught in fault. "I
don't know why it should be I lay awake so
much. My old doctor at home (I bless him
for his inspiration of sending me here!) has
written you about me, I suppose. I dare
say you know I cough sometimes in the
night. Doctor," she asked, abruptly, "who
lives above us?"</p>

<p>He looked interrogatively at the ceiling,
and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so sorry you do not happen
to know. It is a great musician, and I feel
much gratitude towards him. I was becoming
nervous with lying awake&mdash;I was on
the point of calling my poor cousin&mdash;when
some one began playing on the piano in
the room above me. Sweetly, very sweetly.
I could hear it just distinctly enough. It
was a joy. I lay awake, but it soothed me
more than sleep."</p>

<p>"I seem to remember that there is a
music-master living in the house," said the
doctor. "I will beg the <i>padrona</i> to speak to
him. He should not play in the night."</p>

<p>"Not at all," exclaimed Paula, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
warmth he could not expect. "Please, I
want him to play. I shall be grieved if you
say anything to prevent him. It does not
keep me awake. If I were sleepy I could not
hear it."</p>

<p>The doctor prolonged his visit far into the
forenoon. At the first movement he made
to go, Paula said, pleadingly: "Oh, not yet.
I entertain myself so willingly with you!"
And he stayed.</p>

<p>He was interested, in the woman as well
as in the case. She was different from his
other aristocratic patients. She was of a
type new to him; without appearing to, he
studied her face as she spoke, and from it,
and from frequent allusions she dropped, he
built up a theory of her past.</p>

<p>He divined that she was older than she
looked. It was, he resolved, the childlike
glance and smile, the voice as of shyness
overcome, her artlessness, her continually
outcropping ignorance of the world, her
immature mind perhaps, that gave the impression
of youthfulness one at first received
from her. If one looked well, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
had even already a sad little beginning of
faded appearance. Her face was a trifle
broad, and the high cheek-bones were commencing
slightly to accuse themselves, as
they say in French. The charm of her
countenance, to such as felt it, lay in her
eyes: they were unsophisticated, hopeful,
interested, idealizing eyes. Vanity, it must
be pityingly related, had taught her nothing.
Her blond hair, dull and fine and soft&mdash;a
large treasure that would have made the
boast of many another woman&mdash;was drawn
away rigorously from her forehead, braided,
and wound compactly against the back of
her head, like a school-girl's.</p>

<p>He noticed with amused wonder how unpretending&mdash;nay,
provincial, homely, for persons
of rank and fortune&mdash;was the <i>mise</i> of
the two women. Fashion by them was misconstrued,
or else despised. He did not incline
to the latter interpretation of their
plainness; he rather laid to a touching innocence
of the mode's dictates Mamsell
Veronika's pelerine and the black lace tabs
on the sides of her head; the antiquated cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of Paula's deep violet gown, the little black
silk mitts that covered her pale pretty hands
to the point where her rings began. These
were numerous rather than rich, and gave
the impression of being heirlooms&mdash;things
worn for a memory: brilliants mounted in
darkening silver, enamels, carnelians; one
showed a pale gleam of human hair.</p>

<p>Paula had never spoken so much about
herself to any one as she did to the doctor.
Her loquacity was an effect of her unreasoning
instinct that in this new place everything
was good to her, every influence favorable.
She let herself go in a way that would have
seemed out of her nature at home.</p>

<p>All she had ever read in the long, melancholy
winter evenings at Schattenort, of poetry
or romance, came back to her mind in
essence, drawn to the surface by an inexplicable
magic. Her conversation in this
mental excitement teemed with allusions
and modest flowers of speech that almost
surprised herself, and gave her a strange delight.
She felt as she were some one she had
some time read of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, we will make you well, quite well,
soon," said the doctor, cheerily, on taking
his leave. "But you must promise to be
very good, very prudent."</p>

<p>He gave his directions with a light air, but
as he turned from the door a shadow settled
upon his kindly old face.</p>

<p>In his breast-pocket lay folded the letter
his colleague, Paula's former doctor, had
written him. The consciousness of what
was said in it gave rise in his heart to a tender,
grateful thought of his own children&mdash;grown-up
daughters, fair and healthy, happily
established in life.</p>

<p>Paula had hoped to go for a drive that
day, but a light rain fell, and she could only
watch the turbid stream outside through
the glistening window-pane. She sat with
her forehead leaning against it, her book in
her lap. Now and then she opened this and
let her eyes wander over the lines, without
trying to understand, just for a pleasure she
found in its being Italian too.</p>

<p>She had prevailed upon Veronika to go
out for a walk, so that she might amuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
her with an account of what there was to
see.</p>

<p>Towards evening the clouds broke. She
saw the red reflection of the sunset on the
river. Tempted, she opened the balcony
door; a smell of damp stone came gratefully
to her nostrils. She slipped out and leaned
over the cool balusters, and looked up and
down the empty gleaming street. The hills
were as if washed with wine; the air was
sparkling. She heard a footstep; she hoped
it might be Veronika's. She looked. But
it was not a woman. She recognized the
young man who had been on the stairs
when she arrived. He did not look up.
She leaned over to see him disappear in the
<i>portone</i> below. Then, swiftly, she came in-doors
and stopped in the middle of the floor.
She listened intently. In a few moments she
thought to hear, faintly, faintly, footsteps in
the room above. She clasped her hands silently,
saying to herself with unaccountable
excitement: "I knew it already. I knew it
well."</p>

<p>Late in the night again she heard music.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
She had been listening for it a long time.
Night to her was often tediously long. Often
she spent many hours staring at the square
of paler darkness, star-bestrewn, the window
made. At a certain pitch of nervousness,
soon reached when the city had become quiet
and the stillness of the bedroom was full of
mysterious sounds, she always thought of a
dear sister she had lost, rehearsing old sad
scenes vivid in her brain as if they had been
lived through but yesterday. Her own physical
discomfort increased as she thought of
that other girl's long-drawn-out suffering. It
seemed to her that already she could not
breathe; her body was damp with sweat of
fear. "It is all useless!" she groaned, tossing
wretchedly. "I too&mdash;I too am going
that way!" Then she prayed diligently, and
looked out up at the stars with a return of
tranquillity, hoping steadfastly in a beautiful
world beyond them.</p>

<p>But on the night in question she lay
patiently and happily watchful. And late
in the night again she heard music. No
very definite melody was played; it was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
if skilful hands were dreamily straying over
the keys, unravelling a little tangled skein
of musical impression, thinking aloud. The
tune wandered and flitted like a butterfly
over a summer garden. Paula's thought
climbed upward and entered the musician's
chamber. She saw him clearly, leaning back,
looking upward, swaying slightly. She took
joy in the symmetry of his dark Italian face.
She pictured him intensely, and held her
breath gazing. Then she tried to build up
his surroundings; she adorned his room poetically.</p>

<p>Satisfied at last, her imagination folded
its wings and dropped back into its nest.
She merely listened, and let herself be comforted;
accepted passively what dreams the
music imposed. It was as if she and another
were walking in a moonless starry
night along a quiet village road; and the
dewy flowers in the stilly little gardens
skirting the way were giving forth perfume
in the warm dark. Then it was as if another
and she were in a boat with drooping
sail, becalmed, drifting slowly. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
moon was behind a great cloud wonderfully
silvered on the ravelled edges; the sea at
the horizon was a streak of pure light. The
other had laid her on velvet cushions and
covered her with a cloak, was playing and
singing softly to her. They hoped the wind
would not rise. Drifting&mdash;drifting. And she
slept.</p>

<p>In the gayest mood next day she showed
the doctor a little package of letters to different
persons in the city, but said that
she was not ready yet to let these distinguished
ones know of her arrival; she must
first attend to various important things. He
derived from her words that she wished to
make her establishment more elegant, and
became gruff and severe when she asked
him to procure for her the address of the
most fashionable mantua&mdash;maker. She almost
cried when he forbade the expense of
any precious energy on worldly vanities, but
was half consoled by his promise soon to
make her well enough to employ a master
in the art of playing the guitar.</p>

<p>He prescribed a daily drive in the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>niest
hour. Paula came back from her first
excursion with flushed cheeks. Veronika
grumbled: "I will tell the doctor, and he
will forbid your going out at all. It is not
to kneel in damp churches will help you.
You might as well take up your abode in
the cellar."</p>

<p>"Don't scold me," said Paula, gently. "I
had to thank God."</p>

<p>Towards sunset she seated herself on the
balcony wrapped in fleecy white, and looked
down the street towards the Jeweller's
Bridge. She saw Prospero come. But he
did not look up. That night again she
heard him play.</p>

<p>Many times she sat on the balcony and
saw Prospero coming. Sometimes he looked
up, but oftener he passed into the house
unaware of a Countess gazing after him
from above.</p>

<p>Some nights he did not play; those were
restless, disappointed nights for her.</p>

<p>Once or twice she met him on the stairs as
she was going to her carriage; he glanced at
her with an unimpressed eye, then looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
elsewhere, standing against the wall, hat in
hand.</p>

<p>Occasionally she saw him in the street,
but he seemed never to see her. A vague
heartache grew out of those occasions.</p>

<p>The Italian spring deepened in warmth
and color; the air had a fragrance, some
days, as of lilacs; other days, more penetrating,
as of hyacinths. The little hills in
the midst of which Florence lies took on
dewy morning hues of the opal, changing
evening tints of the dark dove's neck. The
pure noon light made the statues in the
King's Garden, where Paula walked sometimes,
look dazzlingly white against the
sombre walls of clipped laurel. The open
country now was full of blossoming fruit
trees; Paula often begged Veronika to
alight from the carriage and gather for
her the flowers she saw shining in the
grass&mdash;primroses and violets, tulips, narcissi,
fleurs-de-lis. She brought home immense
nosegays, which she spent long minutes
breathing; this perfume of Italy went
to her brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>At sunset once a red flower lay by chance
on the rail of the balcony, just where a
movement of her arm would brush it off; it
would drop in the street. A bold thought
crossed her mind. But that evening Prospero
did not come at the usual hour. She
sat outside, trembling slightly as the dusk
closed around her and the dew fell; then
Veronika, with shrill cries of surprise and
blame, came to fetch her in. She felt guilty
and ashamed, and did not protest. She
spent the evening on the divan, with her
face to the wall, crying softly with a vast
invincible melancholy, a sense of forlornness
and failure, giving no explanation of her
humor.</p>

<p>She was kept in-doors for many days after
that. Only she insisted upon being folded
in a fur and seated on the balcony at a certain
hour every afternoon. The beggar-woman
stationed at the street corner with
a basket on her knees got used to seeing
the sick <i>forestiera</i> appear, who always threw
her a bit of silver, and gave her a faint little
smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Veronika suffered from Paula's silence and
depression. She went about with two deep
lines constantly between her updrawn brows.
Her heart misgave her; her inability to communicate
with the doctor and those around
her became a gnawing despair. She formed
a habit, which never left her after, of talking
audibly to herself. She gave up the effort to
hold cheerful conversation with Paula, and
simply tried to preserve in her presence an
unconcerned attitude. She secretly yearned
to be at home. She felt an unappeasable
animosity towards this Italy, that had seemed
to do her Paula so much good, only to
make her worse. She began to hate everything
Italian.</p>

<p>Paula herself sat by the window watching
the hills opposite with an absent face. Now
and then she rose to take a few desultory
steps about the large room, touching the
things, passing her hand over the flowers,
making the guitar-strings give forth a murmur
as she brushed them; she went back to
her chair and closed her eyes, tired out.</p>

<p>Once a friend was walking at Prospero's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
side. They were talking. As they approached,
the friend looked up, and evidently
asked a question of Prospero, who
looked up too: she thought his lips framed
her name. Her heart leaped; she drew
back, faint, and felt foolish at feeling such
pleasure. She waited more eagerly than
usual that night to hear him; it seemed
the music must have a special message for
her. Silence&mdash;utter, atrocious. The night
seemed unending.</p>

<p>The doctor wondered next day what spring
had broken within her. She showed so little
interest in anything; she was fretful as he
had never seen her before. He scarcely
knew how to conduct himself to avoid irritating
her. At a loss, he picked up the little
tome of <i>Vita Nova</i>, that always lay on the table
at her side, and inquired of her progress in it.</p>

<p>"Oh, put it away!" she said, tears springing
to her eyes. "Put it away! I cannot
suffer it. That title exasperates me; it
works upon my nerves. Doctor, doctor, I
shall never be well again!" and she poured
forth a long complaint.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
He feigned to make light of her fears; he
comforted her. Casting about in his mind
for things to say that should divert, interest
her in her gray mood, he found this, which
brought the sudden color to her face:</p>

<p>"Did you not once ask me who lived in
the apartment above? I know now. I will
not take the credit of having applied myself
to discover just on that hint of curiosity from
you; I confess hearing it by chance. Your
neighbor is the young <i>maestro</i> Prospero
C&mdash;&mdash;, celebrated in his way. He has
written an opera, to be produced for the first
time precisely to-night. Those who know
promise great things for it&mdash;"</p>

<p>She had leaned forward, listening thirstily.
The doctor could congratulate himself.</p>

<p>When Veronika went to the door with
him, he turned upon her suddenly, and asked,
almost violently: "Why did you wait so
long? Why did you not bring her to this
climate before?"</p>

<p>She looked at him in a puzzled way, and
in her turn said something he could not understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
He appeared for a moment as if he meant
to shake her, but shrugged his shoulders and
brusquely left.</p>

<p>Some who were present at the first night
of "Parisina" remember well how when the
curtain dropped on the first act and they
looked about to discover whom they should
salute, their attention was arrested by the
strange apparition in one of the second-tier
boxes. There, in a crimson velvet chair, sat
very upright an unknown lady in a gown
such as no one nowadays wears&mdash;a gown of
cloth of gold, that might have figured at a
court ball perhaps a century earlier. An
ermine-lined mantle half covered her arms
and neck, dainty thin and white as wax, and
half extinguished the gleam of her heavy
jewels. A wreath of roses was twined in
her pale hair, that might have made one
laugh in its <i>dmod</i> pretentiousness but that
one divined the lady to be a foreigner from
some Northern country, where perhaps it is
still customary to adorn the hair with a garland.
She held her fan like a sceptre, her fingers
stiffly closed on the pearl sticks. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
mass of roses lay in her lap. She turned a
colorless face upon the stage; her eyes were
wide and glassy, and fixed as a somnambulist's.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the box, less clearly
defined against the darkness, sat an elderly,
soberly clad lady, whose face expressed a
degree of uneasiness, misery, and fear almost
pitiful&mdash;if not comical&mdash;to behold. She
made no pretence of interest in the stage or
the gleaming galleries, but watched her golden-haired
companion with an unswerving,
frightened eye.</p>

<p>No one knew who these were, though
many took pains to discover.</p>

<p>Through the second act the lady in gold
listened breathlessly, as if life itself were suspended.
It seemed to her that the soul left
her body, and went floating up, up, on the
strains of the music. She was praying, praying
with all her strength, for the success of
this work, that the people might feel just
as she felt how it was beautiful!</p>

<p>When a crash of applause came and a call
for the composer, it seemed but an answer to
her prayer. She rose to her feet, radiant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Prospero C&mdash;&mdash; came to the foot-lights
below, looking a slight thing, the acclaimed
great man, in his close black evening dress,
and bowed his thanks. Then, as the applause
continued, he lingered a moment,
and let his eye pass along the friendly
faces in the boxes, a grateful emotion expressed
in his smile.</p>

<p>The lady in gold leaned over the velvet
parapet, breathing short, tremulously smiling,
her flowers in her hands. His eye
passed her unrecognizing. She wanted to
shout: "It is I, Paula! Nothing could
keep me away!" The clamor subsided.
Panting, she leaned back in the shade.</p>

<p>The third act ended in triumph. Again
the composer was called. Paula laughed
and cried at the same time, clapping her
little hands like mad, forgetting herself.</p>

<p>Then, when it was all over and she sat in
the dark carriage rolling homeward, she felt
a chill seizing upon her very heart; she began
to shiver. But her physical condition scarcely
interested her; a sense of the sad things of
life weighed heavily upon her: the vanity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
earthly hopes, the evanescence of happy
things, the inequality in the measure of pain
and pleasure to God's children, the fugitiveness
of illusions, the foolishness of dreams.
She thought of the beggar sitting at the corner
in sun and rain through years: she felt
disgust for a world where such things could
be. She said, "It is a good thing to have
done with it. It is a deliverance. I will
not give it one regret; no, not one." She
felt suddenly that she did not love Italy: it
had betrayed her. "It is you, you who are
to blame," she said, full of helpless resentment,
shaking a pale small hand vaguely
from the window out at the balmy moonlit
world; "you, soft air! you, flower smell!
you, velvety firmament with the many-colored
stars! I was a simple soul: my common
life was enough for me; you sowed in
my unguarded heart all the seeds of vain
dreams, and fostered them. And they bear
no fruit; they wither on their shallow roots&mdash;they
are weeds!&mdash;But I will not curse you,
for God made you lovely."</p>

<p>She closed her eyes; her thoughts turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
to remote Schattenort; she wished she were
there again, in the dull, quiet, big, cold, familiar
country house where she had been
born and bred. A mist of bitter longing
rose in her eyes. The moon was shining
clamorously, obtrusively; it cast a green
light, a light almost warm, on the pale
pavement. She hated its fervent beauty.
"Would God I were home!" she sighed.</p>

<p>Veronika, mistaking her meaning, said,
"You are almost there."</p>

<p>Paula suffered Veronika and her maid to
put her to bed. She seemed not to notice
them. She was thinking&mdash;far away. Out of
habit she listened a moment for the piano
above. But all was silent. "He is happy,"
she said to herself; "he has gone with his
friends. Or perhaps he is up there living it
all over again." And her imagination, touched
anew with the old obstinate insanity, took
the road up to his never-seen chamber, bent
over him, and rejoiced with him. "Oh, if I
could&mdash;" she said; "if I could! But he will
never know how a dying noble lady used to
listen to his playing in the dead of night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and loved him, and left him her blessing&mdash;"</p>

<p>Veronika had no sleep that night. Before
day the doctor was summoned. He remained
several hours. At going he drew Veronika
aside, and by signs succeeded at last in
procuring from her the package of letters the
Countess had once shown him. He looked
at the superscriptions, and took from among
them one "To the Abb S&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>That evening he brought with him a white-haired
old man in priestly garb, whom Veronika
was relieved to hear address her in
her native tongue.</p>

<p>Presently, with muffled footsteps and a
frightened, solemn mien, she led him into
the Countess's bedroom, dimly lighted by
shaded candles, and left them long alone
together.</p>

<p>Prospero, returning home that night, opened
the window wide and stood a moment
looking out at the stars, at peace with life,
every desire for the moment hushed, satisfied.
Then he lighted the candles on the
piano, and the faint yellow illumination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
brought out a hint of color in the objects
around. It showed an ordinary, rather bare
room; he lived in it very little. The littering
music and the piano formed its chief
adornment.</p>

<p>He sat down, but for a moment did not
touch the keys. He removed the flower
from his coat and smelt it, thinking of
Rosina, who had given it him at the theatre
door&mdash;Rosina with the broad velvet-faced
hat, the tight silk dress, the diamonds in her
ears, and the small basket of flowers on her
arm. She was pretty&mdash;oh, pretty! Having
thought how pretty she was, he wisely tossed
away her faded favor, determining to remain
cold and prudent. He shook back his
hair, as if thereby to free his mind of her,
spread his hands over the ivory keys, and
began, as he loved to do before sleeping, to
let his fancies and emotions make themselves
sound.</p>

<p>He played long, losing himself, finding a
melodious vesture for his half-formed dream.
The night was very quiet; it came to be
very late without his perceiving it. Sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>ly
he felt a cool air on his forehead&mdash;he
looked up, and paused in his playing, his
hands motionless above the keys, his lips
open. He felt that he ought to speak, but
his voice failed to answer his will. He was
asking himself in the dim background of his
consciousness how the Countess Paula von
Schattenort had entered his dwelling so
noiselessly, and what she might be seeking
there. More clearly he was wondering at
her face, strangely still and white, vaguely
woe-begone, astonished, pathetic. He
recognized her, yet she seemed to him altered
from the one he sometimes saw on the
balcony and met on the stairs&mdash;that object
without interest, a woman not pretty. Perhaps
it was the wonderful hair that, shining
along her cheeks like a pale gilded mist,
transfigured her. The firm fine braids that
heretofore he had seen always wound in
austere simplicity about her head were undone;
the narrowly waved hair floated to her
knees; her face peered wistfully between
two shimmering bands of it. She was
clothed in a white garment bordered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
dark fur; a heavy rosary hung about her
neck.</p>

<p>She looked at him a long moment with
fixed eyes, an expression of plaintive disillusion,
and said nothing.</p>

<p>He tried to ask in what manner he might
serve her, but his tongue was numb.</p>

<p>She turned and looked all about the room,
very slowly, as a person seeking something.
Then she looked again at him, silently, with
that same face of disappointment; and her
hands, that had been tightly shut on the
golden crucifix appended to her rosary,
opened and slipped softly to her sides. She
turned to the door. He rose from his seat,
and without taking his eyes from her, fumbled
to lift the candle from its socket, to light
her way; he was awkward in his amazement.
He saw her pass the threshold. In a second
he followed her. She was not in the next
room. He passed through the two rooms
that separated him from the door leading to
the common stairway. He came to the door;
it was as he had left it, secured for the night.
Seized with dismay, in spite of the thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
that she must have lingered behind in the
shady embrasure of a window, he undid the
chain and bolt and came out on the landing
and looked, expecting inconsistently to see a
white figure vanishing down the steps. He
saw nothing but a faint light cast upon the
wall at the turn of the stairs. He stood hesitating.</p>

<p>In a moment he heard below a sound of
weeping; he went down with a trembling of
the knees. On the landing of the <i>piano
nobile</i> was the landlady. She had set her
little brass lamp on the last step, and was crying.
The door to the Countess's apartment
was wide open, and the draught from there
made the tiny flame flicker and smoke.</p>

<p>"What is it?" said Prospero, in a husky
whisper.</p>

<p>"She is dead, the poor lady!" sobbed the
<i>padrona</i>.</p>

<p>He felt his hair softly rising.</p>

<h2 id="DORASTUS">DORASTUS</h2></div>


<p>She had large violet eyes, of a melancholy
effect, and fine honey-colored hair, flowing
smoothly over her ears. She looked excessively
meek and always a little apprehensive,
as if accustomed to reproaches, yet never
quite hardened to them. One easily supposed
her to be an orphan.</p>

<p>She lived with an aunt, her mother's half-sister,
considerably older and less pleasing
than her mother in that charming woman's
brief day. Her cousins were all older than
she; the girls were so perfect in every respect
that intimacy between her and them was out
of the question; the son, a big, blunt young
man, was mostly away, and, when at home,
too much taken up with other interests to be
more than just aware of the violet eyes. So,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
life was very dull for Emmeline&mdash;"Emmie"
she was familiarly called.</p>

<p>She went often of an evening to her
mother's grave, and, sitting beside it, reflected
how it was in keeping with the general
sadness of things that there should be no
prospect of any change for her in all the
years of her life, no change from the present
weary round of aunt and cousins, of sterile
duties and insipid pleasures.</p>

<p>And there, by her mother's grave, came
the very change she was sighing for. She sat
on the sward, musingly watching the square
tower of the church grow gray against
the delicate, flushed sky, when she became
aware of a stranger going from stone to stone
in the fading light, examining the inscriptions.
At first she was afraid. While she debated
whether to hide or flee, the stranger approached,
and in a foreign voice and accent
asked some common question about the
place. She could not answer readily for a foolish
shame mixed with terror. She got to her
feet, blushing, then turning pale. It could be
none other than the astonishing fiddler who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
had played the night before in the hall at
Colthorpe, and who could, they said, make
your hair rise on end by the power of weird,
unearthly music, or your eyes dissolve with
tenderness&mdash;as he chose. She stared without
speech into his dark, peculiar face. And he,
seeing that she was discomfited, instead of
apologizing and withdrawing, undertook, in a
tone as persuasive as his violin's, to set her at
ease. And when a few days later he disappeared
from that part of the world, the violet
eyes disappeared too.</p>

<p>Aunt Lucretia in time received a letter,
asking her forgiveness and announcing Emmie's
marriage.</p>

<p>She did not grant her forgiveness until
several years later, after due savoring of sad,
black-bordered letters from Emmie, imploring
kindness. Her husband, after a brief illness,
was dead; her little boy and she were left
alone, without anything in the world. She acknowledged
her fault so humbly; she owned
so freely that her marriage had been excessively&mdash;deservedly&mdash;wretched;
she longed
so desperately to be taken back into her old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
home, that Lucretia found herself relenting.
Her daughters were now married and lived
at a distance; she felt daily more and more
the need of a female companion. Her son,
after reading the young widow's pitiful appeals,
protested that it would be inhuman to
refuse her a shelter. It was decided that she
should be allowed to come, and in time the
big, blunt Gregory, of whom she had been
afraid in old days, went a long stretch of the
journey to meet her, for that had seemed to
him requisite, though to his mother superfluous.
He even crossed the arm of sea that
she must presently be crossing, with no apparent
purpose but to cross it again with her.</p>

<p>When the boat was well out at sea and
the passengers had disposed themselves
in patience about the deck, he marched up
and down, as did several of the others, and,
while avoiding to look like one in search,
sought diligently the remembered face of his
cousin.</p>

<p>It was a cheerless gray day. The sea was
quiet; the boat pitched but slightly. He
was not long unsuccessful; when he had satis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>fied
himself that she was not in the crowd on
the windside, he went to lee and saw her
sitting almost alone. She might have gone
there for warmth. She did not seem to
notice that cinders and fine soot were raining
down upon her. He found himself disinclined
to accost her at once; he went to lean
where he could watch her without pointed
appearance of curiosity.</p>

<p>She looked mournful in her black things&mdash;not
the new, crisp crape of well-to-do bereavement,
but a poor gentlewoman's ordinary
shabby black. Her cheeks had lost their
pretty roundness; the effect of her eyes was
more than ever melancholy. The pale little
face, set in its faint-colored hair, framed in
its black bonnet, might pass a hundred times
unnoticed: it had little to arrest the attention;
but attention, by whatever chance
once secured, must be followed by a gentle,
compassionate interest in the breast of the
beholder. This emotion felt Gregory.</p>

<p>She sat on one of the ship's benches, hugging
her black wrap about her, hiding in it
her little gloveless hands. A bundle was on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
her lap, at her feet a large bag. She looked
wearily off over the crumpled leaden plain,
and now and then called: "Dorastus! Dorastus!"</p>

<p>At that, a toddling bundle came towards
her, never near enough to be caught, and
toddled off again, coming and going busily,
with muttered baby soliloquy. He was a
comical little figure, clumsily muffled against
the cold, with a pointed knit cap drawn well
down over his ears. If he ignored her call,
she rose and fetched him, shaking his little
hand and bidding him not to go again so far
from mother. He dragged at his arm, squealing
the while she exhorted, and almost tumbled
over when she let him loose. Then he
resumed his interrupted play.</p>

<p>After a time he seemed to tire of it. He
came to his mother and, touching the bag at
her feet, unintelligibly demanded something.
She shook her head. He seemed to repeat
his demand. "No, no, Dorastus&mdash;mother
can't!" she said, fretfully. Then this dot of
humanity made himself formidable. Gregory
watched in surprise the little imperious face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
become disquietingly like an angry man's.
He hammered with both small fists on his
mother's knee, and stamped and loudly sputtered.
She caught his arms for a moment
and held them quiet; mother and child
looked each other in the face, his strange,
unbabyish, heavy-browed eyes flaming, hers
lit with a low smouldering resentment. He
struggled from her grasp, and at last, as his
conduct was beginning to attract attention,
she stooped, vanquished, and, bruising her
fingers on the awkward buckles, undid the
bag.</p>

<p>Gregory at this point approached and
spoke to her by name. She lifted her face,
her eyes full of helpless tears. She reddened
faintly on recognizing him. She handed
the boy a diminutive toy-fiddle from the
bag. Pacified, he retired at a little distance
and, while his mamma and the gentleman
entered into conversation, scraped seriously,
the tassel on the tip of his cap bobbing with
his funny little <i>airs de tte</i>.</p>

<p>"How good of you, how good of you&mdash;how
comforting to me!" she said, her forlorn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
face softly brightening; "I was getting so
tired of taking care of myself! I have never
travelled alone, and&mdash;and I am so timid&mdash;"</p>

<p>How different seemed the old house to
Emmie returning! She settled down in it
with the sense of passionate contentment. I
can imagine in a dove restored to the cote
after escaping the fowler's snare and the rage
of wintry storms. How shut it was against
the cold! how safe from arrogant men demanding
money! Life in it now seemed to
her one round of luxurious pleasures: one
could sleep undisturbed, tea and buttered
bread came as regularly as the desire for
them; flowers bloomed at every season on
mantel-shelf and table; the grate glowed as
if to glow were no more than a grate's nature.
There was undeniably the domestic tyrant
still; but what a mild one by comparison!
Aunt Lucretia might be peremptory and
critical and contradictory: to Emmie in these
days she personated a benevolent Providence.
It is possible that the lady's disposition had
softened towards her niece: her superior
daughters were removed, and the little widow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
with her manifold experiences was unquestionably
a person more interesting to have
about than the moping girl of yore.</p>

<p>The two ladies, sitting together with their
wools, in undertones talked over Emmie's
married miseries. She was as ready with her
confidences as Aunt Lucretia with her listening
ear. There seemed no end to what she
had to tell or the number of times she might
relate the same incident and be heard out with
tolerance. She was glad of some one to whom
to unburden her heart of its accumulated
grievance; she could not but be a little glad,
too, now it was well over, that so much that
was unusual had happened to her, since it lent
her this importance. Aunt Lucretia gave a
great deal of good advice&mdash;said what she would
have done in like case; Emmie accepted it
with as much humble gratitude as if it had
still been of service. She concurred with all
her heart in her aunt's unqualified condemnation
of her first lapse from the respectable
path&mdash;her elopement; she declared with perfect
sincerity that she was puzzled to explain
how it all happened&mdash;certainly before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
a week had been over the folly of it had
stared her in the face.</p>

<p>The young widow, when she had taken
her aunt through scenes of rage and jealousy
that made that matron's nostrils open
as a war-horse's, and had shown up the petty
tyrannies and meannesses of a bad-tempered,
vindictive, vain man, afflicted with a set of
morbidly tense nerves, would sometimes inconsistently
betray a sort of pride in the
fact that she had been adored by this erratic
being, whose ill-treatment of her came partly
from that fact; also a certain pride in the
assurance she had had on every side, of his
being a great artist who might have risen to
fortune had he been blessed with a different
constitution. A prince had once, in token of
his appreciation, bestowed on him a jewelled
order; Emmie wished she had not been
forced to sell it when he was ill. She herself
could not judge of his playing&mdash;she
could not abide the sound of a violin&mdash;but
the star might be accounted a proof of his
ability.</p>

<p>"You were too meek, my dear," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Lucretia, conclusively, after a tale of oppression;
"I should have taken a stand."</p>

<p>"Dear aunt," said Emmie, pensively considering
her relative's size and the cast of
her features, "I think you would. He would
have been afraid of you. If I displeased him,
he said I was rebellious because I felt myself
bolstered up by the admiration of whoever
in the inn had happened to give me
a passing glance, and he would torment me
until I swore I loved him with every thought
of my life. Sometimes, when he had made
me cry, he would cry, too&mdash;I hate that in a
man, aunt!&mdash;and go on tormenting me until
I said I forgave him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, I should have taught him a lesson!"</p>

<p>"Yes, aunt, you would. But I swore whatever
he pleased. If I was sulky, he was as
likely as not to sit up all night, wailing on
his violin when I wanted to sleep. He always
took remote chambers at inns, for the
privilege of playing at night, if he pleased.
If I complained, he said that if I had liked
the music it would have soothed me to sleep,
and if I did not like it, it was well I should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
kept awake. He was very sore on the
point of my not being in love with his
music."</p>

<p>"I should like to see a man play the fiddle
in my bedroom!" said Aunt Lucretia, with a
face of danger.</p>

<p>And Emmie, from this lady's example and
counsel, got a retrospective courage that enabled
her in memory, now that she was well-fed,
well-dressed, and possessed of the assurance
that goes with those conditions, to
bring the stormy scenes with her husband to
an end more honorable to herself. She could
imagine herself even braving him&mdash;when,
perhaps, would come in sight Dorastus. Then
her heart would sink in consciousness of its
folly. There was no contending for her with
a nature like that. That baby could bend
her to his will even as the father had done.
He was so little now that she could not strive
with him to any enduring advantage; and
when he would be bigger, she felt it already,
no revolt of hers would be of use. The tyranny
was handed down from father to son, with
the sensitiveness and the jealousy. She look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>ed
over at the little, intrepid face sometimes
with a sort of slave's aversion: every day he
would be more like that other; he kept him
disagreeably alive now in her memory with
the tricks of his face, the difficulties of his
temper. She only hoped, in an unformed
way as yet, that before he grew to make
himself heavily felt something might have
arisen for her protection.</p>

<p>She made him pretty things with a mother's
full indulgence, caressed him in due
measure, and gave dutiful attention to his
every request; but deep in her heart and in
her eye was a reservation. And in him,
though he could hardly frame speech, seemed
an inherited suspicion of this want of loyalty
in her, a consciousness of her appeal to something
outside, against him. In his baby
rages he seemed aware, by an instinct beyond
his understanding, that she did not care for
them, except that they made her uncomfortable,
and he beat her with all his fierce little
strength for it. She belonged strictly to him,
and there was always treachery in the air; so
he must be foes with all surrounding her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
most severe with herself, whom he idolatrously
loved.</p>

<p>Often, if they were alone and she did nothing
to cross him, but treated respectfully his
every whim, he rewarded her gravely with
such tokens of his devotion as he could devise.
If they were out under the trees, he
would make a hundred little voyages and
from each bring back some treasure, flower
or pebble, that he dropped in her lap, watching
her face to see if she were appropriately
pleased. If she were busy with her stitching
and after a time forgot to acknowledge his
gift, he would make known his disgust by
taking everything from her and stamping it
under foot; but if she wisely kept her whole
mind on him, and gave him praise and smiles,
and admired his offerings, he would multiply
his efforts to please her, get her things the
most difficult and perilous to obtain, stones
that were heavy, insects that were frightful,
parade before her every little accomplishment,
be dbonnaire and royal, and expose
his true worshipping heart to his servant.</p>

<p>Woe if in such moments of expansion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Gregory came out on the lawn and took the
empty seat on the rustic bench beside Emmie!
The child would know nothing of a
divided allegiance, and showed his sense of
outrage by a prompt attack on both, whom
he seemed to think equally conspirators
against his peace. They stood his babbled
vituperation and baby blows with smiling patience
for a little, trying to converse coherently
under them; then, when he burst into
angry tears, with a sigh the mother bore him
off to be lectured and calmed, resuming her
conversation with Gregory at a more opportune
moment. Before Gregory she never
spoke of her husband.</p>

<p>With the passing months her cheek got
back its freshness, her eye its clear brightness.
Now a haunting fear awoke in her
breast: Aunt Lucretia was wearying of
her presence. She had heard all of her injuries
till the story was stale. She was beginning
to find fault with her just as of old,
to set her back in her place now and then
with the former terrible abruptness, and
that place a very low one. The poor little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
woman accepted all abjectly, shuddering at
the possibility of being again cast on the
world with her child. She went about with
reddened eyelids and a look of pathetic nervousness,
hushing Dorastus whenever he
lifted his voice, doing her pitiful best that
neither should give offence. Gregory could
not look on in patience: he laid the gentle
afflicted creature's tremors forever by asking
her to become his wife.</p>

<p>His mother left the house and went to
abide with her daughters. But in time she
became reconciled to what was unalterable
and returned to her ancient seat of government,
allowing her age to be cheered by
the sight of her favorite child's happiness.
Little sons and daughters, his wife gave him
four, among whom prevailed straw-colored
hair and eyes of the admired flower tint. The
old house was gay as at early dawn a tree
full of gossiping birds.</p>

<p>So to Emmie was raised a mighty salvation;
against Dorastus arrayed themselves
innocent yellow heads, like so many insuperable
golden lances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>When the children were called into the
drawing-room to be shown to the company,
a visitor was sure to ask, "And who is this
little man?" meaning Dorastus; so unlikely
did it appear that he could be of his mother's
kindred. To the golden hen, her golden
brood. How in seriousness call a chick the
little black creature with the large beak and
the piercing eyes?</p>

<p>And as unlike his brothers as he was
physically, so unlike he remained in disposition.
By all the children as by Dorastus
himself the difference in kind was felt. He
remained solitary among them and at odds
with all. They set him down a domineering,
bad-tempered thing, and he summed
them up scornfully as a pack of pudding-heads.
It was not plain to any one why
he thought himself superior: his actual
accomplishments were somewhat less than
ordinary. Bullet-headed, downright Hector,
his brother nearest in age, could beat
him at any sport, and when their differences
brought them to blows was rather more than
half sure of victory over his senior, inferior to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
him in size and art; Martin was cleverer than
he at his books; the little girls even could
give him points in conduct&mdash;yet his attitude
of every minute insisted upon it that he was
better than any of them, and that his mother
was more particularly his mother than she
was theirs. Emmie, it is true, did not reprove
him quite as she did Hector; he was allowed
more than the others the full swing of his
temperament. His step-father punctiliously
refrained from meddling with him, and if he
made trouble with his temper and his pride
Emmie warned her nice-natured children not
to irritate him, to make allowances for him.
Insensibly that qualified the relation between
Dorastus and his mother. That negative
indulgence he felt, however dimly, did not
prove him a favorite: it made him a sort of
alien. He became more reserved in his demands
upon his mother. There were too
many yellow heads for one boy to contend
with successfully by ordinary means. He
still held to it bravely in his attitude towards
his brothers and sisters that he was better
than they, and that his mother belonged ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>clusively
to him, but herself he troubled less
and less with his jealousy and his claims. It
might have seemed at last almost as if she
were become indifferent to him. Absorbed
by her domestic cares, she had scarcely perceived
the change.</p>

<p>The cares were many, but pleasant in their
nature. Gregory was steadily, lazily kind,
the children were healthy, she herself was in
the beautiful full bloom of life&mdash;she found it
good. She had almost forgotten the bitter
taste of her beginnings, when one night, startled
from a deep sleep, she lay in the dark
awhile and wondered that she should dream
so clearly of hearing the long, low wail of a
violin. It had recreated about her in an instant
the atmosphere of old days. She lay
as she had lain often enough, with lead upon
her heart, a dead sense of there being no escape
in view from this slavery, this poverty,
this succession of weary travel and third-rate
inns, this nerve-racking sound of the violin
penetrating through the brain as a red-hot
needle&mdash;no release from this unrelenting
master, this terrible added burden of baby.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
She shook herself free from what she thought
the remaining effect of a nightmare; she had
seemed for a moment to smell the very essence
her first husband used on his hair,
mixed with the flat odor of the small Dutch
inn-chamber in which Dorastus was born.
She turned over on her side to sleep again,
when she became assured that she heard a
violin. She listened through her thick heart-beats,
a thrill of superstitious horror stiffening
her skin. She knew it unreasonable, but
could not dispel her fear. She rose sitting
in bed, becoming at last fully awake. Still
she heard the violin, sounding faintly, as if
from some distant part of the house. Then
she thought. It had been these long years
in the garret, the treasured Amati he had
made her swear to keep for his child. The
child had found it.</p>

<p>She could not fall to sleep again, she must
satisfy herself.</p>

<p>She slipped her feet into their shoes, got
her dressing-gown about her, and crept
through the shadowy corridor, up the stair,
to where Dorastus slept. Since he would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the master, whoever shared his room, which
was obviously unfair to his room-mate, he
had been allotted a little chamber by himself
in a somewhat remote part of the house.</p>

<p>As she approached it, the sound of the
violin came more and more clear to her.
She stopped and leaned against the balusters,
yielding to a soul-sickness that had its
rise in she scarce knew which, memory or
foreboding. She listened curiously. It was
strange playing, though simple, subdued to
not wound the night silence; unordinary as
it was, there was nothing tentative about it,
the hands seemed going to it with a fine
boldness, a delicate natural skill. The mother
felt not a moment's joy.</p>

<p>She came to the door, opened it noiselessly,
and stood in the doorway with her candle
shining upward in her wide eyes, her solemn
face.</p>

<p>Dorastus stopped playing, and said, with a
gleeful, short laugh, "I knew it would make
you come!"</p>

<p>As Emmie had expected, he held the
Amati. He had thrown off his jacket and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
tie and stood in his shirt-sleeves, with his
neck bare. His dark eyes were burning and
dancing; his black hair was ruffled and
pushed up on end; his face was hotly
flushed. His whole attitude had in it something
new, finely expressive of conscious
power.</p>

<p>"I knew it would make you come!" he
said, with a triumphant nod.</p>

<p>She entered and set down her light on the
little chest of drawers. "You ought not to
play at night," she said, faintly. "It disturbs
people's sleep."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't wake <i>them</i>!" he exclaimed,
scornfully, "and if it did I shouldn't care,
as long as they didn't come and bother. I
wanted to call you, to make you come to
me. I was sure I could. Are you cold,
little mother dear? Get into my bed."</p>

<p>He laid down his instrument; he came
where she stood, with her silken hair tumbling
over her shoulders, and felt her chilled
hands.</p>

<p>"No, no," she said, irritably, taking them
from him, "it is unheard of, playing at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
hour of the night. I must go." But she
went mechanically to sit on the edge of his
bed, that had not been lain in that night,
and still kept towards him that wondering,
dismayed face.</p>

<p>"How did it sound?" asked the boy, whose
excitement seemed to dull his perception, so
that he remained unchilled by her want of
warmth. "Did it say plainly, Arise, wrap
your sky-blue gown about you, never mind
tying up your gold hair, light your light, and
come gliding through the shadow of the
sleeping house, to your dear son, the only
one who loves you, in his solitary room, far
from all the others? That is what I meant
it should say, but towards the end I meant
it to say something else, towards the end it
was explaining. Did you understand that
part?"</p>

<p>"How did you find it?" asked Emmie,
still in her faint voice. "Why did you take
it without asking our permission? Who
taught you to play on it?"</p>

<p>The boy laughed again his gleeful laugh.
He got on to the bed beside her and sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
with his chin in his hand, his glowing face
full of pride in himself. "Ah, how I found
it, when it was up in the garret? It was like
that story of the Greek fellow&mdash;what's his
name?&mdash;dressed like a girl. When the peddler
brought shawls and ribbons and things,
and a sword hidden among them, he took
the sword, and the peddler knew by that sign
that he was a man. In the garret there
were old hoop-skirts, and broken mousetraps,
and bird-cages, and boxes full of
religious books and things&mdash;but my hand
went straight to the violin!"</p>

<p>"Tell me the truth, Dorastus," spoke his
mother, wearily.</p>

<p>"Well, then, after talking with a certain
person, I concluded that it must be there.
I looked for it and found it, months and
months ago. I took it and learned to play,
to give you a surprise. Do you think I can
ever play as my father did?"</p>

<p>"Whom have you heard speak of your
fathers playing, Dorastus?"</p>

<p>"Aha! There is some one who remembers
him at this very place&mdash;who heard him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
just once and never forgot it. I might as
well tell you: it is the brother of the inn-keeper's
wife at Colthorpe; he used to be
the hostler, but is too old now. He plays
the violin himself, at weddings, sometimes,
and dances&mdash;but not much, dear. He taught
me, but I have gone far ahead&mdash;oh, far ahead
of him now! He knows when it is good,
however, and you should hear what he says
of me and my playing. You must see him
and ask him. He had climbed up from outside
into the window when once my father
played at Colthorpe, and he can speak of it
as if it had happened yesterday. (He says
that I am very like my father, that any one
would know me who had seen him. He
knew, before asking, whose son I was.
Only, my father wore his hair long; well,
I will wear my hair long!) He says that,
as he played, every trouble he had ever
had came back to him, even the death of a
dog, and he could not help crying&mdash;but he
liked it; he enjoyed feeling bad. And he
says that it made him see plain before him,
but not very plain either, a lot of things he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
had only heard folks talk about&mdash;the shepherds
in the East, for instance, with the
angels singing good-will in a hole in the
clouds. And he knew for sure, he says,
how it would have felt if the girl he wanted
hadn't married some one else and gone to
live away, but had taken him. I asked him,
the other day, if I could make him feel those
things. He said, 'Not yet, not quite yet;'
but he thought I was beginning. He has a
number of music sheets; I can read the
notes much quicker than he already, though
he taught me. But I don't care for those;
there must be others much better than those!
Those are nothing! I like better what I
make up myself than I do those. Did you
notice&mdash;but no, you must have been too far&mdash;how
quickly I can play some passages?
My left fingers go like a spider, and it is so
easy for them! Giles says my hand is like
my father's&mdash;he remembers it&mdash;a true violinist's
hand. I feel that it can do anything,
dear&mdash;anything! And I mean that it shall
do such things! Look at it, mother!" and
he held up the thin, unboyishly delicate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
angular hand, stronger in appearance than
the rest of his body. "Is it like my father's?
You are the one, of course, that remembers
best. Is it like my father's?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;yes!" she almost moaned.</p>

<p>He did not seem to perceive her impatience,
but contemplated his own hand a
little while, calmly sure that he must be an
object of pride to her now. "It is quite
unlike Hector's, at least. I should like to
see him try to play with his pink paws!"</p>

<p>"He might not be able to play," said
Emmie, "but he will, I dare say, do something
quite as useful."</p>

<p>"There is nothing quite so useful!" cried
the boy superbly, and laughed again in his
perverse glee. "It is more useful than anything
you can invent to say that Hector is
going to do. Hector! Hector will be a
rabbit-raiser; he likes rabbits better than
anything. But I will come with my violin
and make the rabbits stand up on their hind-legs
and stare; I will play softly, wheedlingly,
going slowly backwards towards the woods,
and they will all come after me, without stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>ping
for a nibble. I will lead them away,
away, all the flock of little, round-backed,
skipping things&mdash;just as I made you get out
of bed and come up here."</p>

<p>"I came to tell you to stop, foolish boy.
I didn't want you to wake the others. It
was very inconsiderate in you&mdash;very inconsiderate.
And I am not sure that I am
pleased with you for taking a thing so valuable&mdash;it
is worth a great deal of money&mdash;unknown
to me, or for doing things in secret,
or for having dealings with people I know
nothing of&mdash;hostlers and inn-keepers' wives.
You certainly play nicely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, did you truly think I did, mother?"
he asked, eagerly. "You ought to know; you
used to hear himself. Now, tell me, dear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I am not at all sure"&mdash;she interrupted
him, lamely querulous&mdash;"that the
violin&mdash;You have been so underhanded,
and I see now how you waste your time&mdash;it
explains your being so bad with your lessons.
I am not at all sure that the violin
ought not to be taken from you."</p>

<p>"I shall not give it up!" Dorastus said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
instantly, and it might be perfectly understood
that he would struggle with his last
breath to keep it, doing as much damage as
in him lay to his opposers.</p>

<p>Emmie, quite pale, looked into his face,
that had fully returned from its mood of
happy pride, and he looked into hers, as
they had looked already when he was but a
baby. Then, seeing what she had always
seen, she tossed up her hands with a little
helpless, womanish motion, and complained:
"Oh, I am so cold, and I feel so ill! It is
like a horrid dream&mdash;and I am miserable."
She rose and pulled her things about her
to go, tears shining on her cheek.</p>

<p>Dorastus, who had leaped up and laid his
hand resolutely on his violin and bow, if they
should be in any immediate danger, watched
her with a strange face. His jaw was iron.
When, as she reached the door, he unclinched
his teeth to speak, his face worked in
spite of him and tears gushed from his eyes.
"You never understand anything!" he exploded,
in a harsh, angry voice all his pride
could not keep from breaking. Then, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the indignant scorn of a child for a grown-up
person who seems to him out of all nature
dull&mdash;"Go!" he said, beating his arms violently
about, "Go! Go!"</p>

<p>So Dorastus retained the violin, and defiantly
played on it, in and out of season. His
mother's failure to be pleased with his playing
seemed to have cut her off, in his estimation,
from all right to an opinion. It is true
that after the first night she armed herself
with patience towards a situation she could
not change. She did not cross the boy more
than her conscience positively enjoined; he
might play since he pleased, but must not
neglect his studies in pursuit of a vain pastime.</p>

<p>In spite of her, his studies suffered. He
felt no humiliation now that Hector or any
should be ahead of him with books; he could
have been far ahead of them if he had chosen,
but they could under no circumstance
have done what he did. Of these things he
was proudly convinced, and he declared them
without hesitation. His almost untutored
playing took on a strange audacity, a fantas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>tical
quality that made it pleasing to none in
the household. That did not disturb him;
he pursued triumphantly in the direction repugnant
to them, taking their disapproval to
naturally point to its excellence. Sometimes,
half in scorn, he would play for the little
girls the simple melodies they knew, to show
them that he could do that, too, if he chose;
full tenderly could he play them and delight
their gentle hearts, but he preferred, if he
could catch an unprejudiced soul for audience,
a housemaid for instance, to set her opposite
to him and play to her from his head,
then question her as to what the music had
made her think of, helping her to detail her
impressions, expressing his contempt freely
if the music had not had on her the desired
effect, but hugging her if she happened to
answer as he wanted.</p>

<p>Whenever he had a holiday, or took one,
he disappeared with his instrument, returning
with a conqueror's mien, out of place in a
boy with whom every one is displeased, and
who has had nothing to eat. It was felt by
all how he was in these days not friends with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
anybody, nor anybody friends with him. It
suited his pride to carry off the situation as
if he had been a king among boors.</p>

<p>Her eldest child's conduct began at last to
be something of a grievance to Emmie. She
appealed to no one for help to reduce him to
obedience. She would not have dared do
that; an intimate sense forbade it, a scruple
which would have had no voice, perhaps, had
she loved him more. She excused and up-held
him in her little wars with Lucretia, and
respected Gregory's reluctance to interfere
with him, founded in justice on the consciousness
of a deep-seated, invincible dislike; but
she fretted under his undutifulness and only
refrained from satisfying the desire to attempt
asserting her power over him, though it
should be futile as ever, in the idea that, at
the worst, he would soon be leaving home,
with Hector, for school, when the detested
violin must be given up and stronger hands
than her own find a way to bend his obstinate
spirit. At the same time, in a corner of her
heart, she felt unreasonably, unaccountably
hurt, as perhaps she would have felt if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Dorastus's father had suddenly ceased from
his persecutions and she had known by that
sign that, worm as he was, he had ceased to
care for her.</p>

<p>"This is all very well; but when you get
to school&mdash;" Phrases begun on that line
became frequent in Dorastus's ear as the
time approached. He heard them with a
singularly bright eye.</p>

<p>The two boys set out for school together,
under the guardianship of the tutor. Consternation
fell on the family when it was
known that Dorastus had been missed on
the way. The boy was traced to London;
there he was easily lost among the millions
of its inhabitants.</p>

<p>While the question was in discussion
whether it behooved Gregory himself to travel
to London and institute a search for the
runaway, came a letter from the boy, making
it easily decent for his step-father to leave
the stinging weed to get its growth where it
might without being a nuisance, and reconciling
his mother to letting him take his
chances as he pleased, since he was so sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
they were brilliant&mdash;very brilliant, those
chances.</p>

<p>His certainty of himself, his enthusiasm,
were such that gradually they communicated
themselves in a degree to her. Why not?
After all, his father, they had said, was a
great man; princes had honored him. An
involuntary respect crept through her for
Dorastus's daring. It seemed advisable at
least to give him the opportunity he wanted;
the more that the process of finding him,
bringing him back in what to him would
seem ignominy, and thereafter keeping watch
over him, was uncomfortable to think of.</p>

<p>His letter was to his mother, a mixture of
boyishness and manliness, more frank than
any speech she had had from him in a long
time. It vaguely stirred her heart; for it
seemed to restore to her something that possessing
she had not prized, but, careful economist,
did not like to think lost.</p>

<p>"You must promise that I shall not be
troubled by any attempt to get me back. I
will do anything terrible if I am trapped.
Don't you see that I couldn't go to school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
with Hector, who is younger? We should be
put in classes together, for a while at least,
and I couldn't stand it. Besides, I haven't
the time, I have so much to do! Besides, I
couldn't go on living with <i>those people</i> forever.
I don't mean that you shall, either. I
won't tell you all now, but after a time you
may know that there is to be a house much
better than theirs for you to live in, with me.
You shall have everything much better. But
I will not tell you more. Only, you can be
perfectly sure of it. You will not think that
I came away without caring about leaving
you. I was afraid you would guess something
if I hugged you before them as I
wanted to, but I had been to your room in
the night, and any of your gowns you put on
is full of your son's kisses. If I thought you
would show this letter, I think that I should
never in my life write you again. If you
should send me any money, I should return
it at once or destroy it, so please don't do it,
it would make me angry. I know that we
had nothing when we came to their house,
except the violin. One of the servants told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
me how we came. What do you suppose
keeping me all these years has cost? When
I can, I mean to give them double; you can
tell him so, if you choose. I can't now, but
what I can do is to take nothing more from
them. You need not be anxious about me.
I am prepared, because I have long known
what I meant to do, and I can take care of
myself. I have met several persons already
who know of my father; it seems to be something
here to be his son, though not at home,
except to one man, and he a hostler. Well,
I will show them&mdash;you, too, dear mother. I
don't mean to vex or grieve you, mother,
dear. If I have vexed you, I know I shall
make you forgive me some day, before long,
perhaps, when I shall have made you understand.
You can write me at the Tartar's
Head, but if you hunted me there, or information
concerning me, you would never find
me, I vow."</p>

<p>Other letters came from time to time,
written in fine spirits always, referring, but
mysteriously, to fine successes. Emmie felt
a certain modesty about these letters. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
communicated what was in them with reserve,
and adopted towards inquirers the tone
of discretion that the letters had with herself.
But she found herself often brooding
over the contents. They charmed the imagination;
they sounded like things one
read. It was so remarkable, this circumstance
of a poor boy, a boy of her own, arriving in
a great city, with little but his violin, and by
sounds merely forcing the things one values
to come to him, as he had spoken fancifully
once, she remembered, of making a flock of
rabbits follow him into the woods. He wrote
little very definite, but dropped telling hints
of how he had played before this great man
and that man of importance, and this one had
said&mdash;the other had promised. He had been
called upon to perform at a certain levee, and
out of his fee had bought the things he was
sending; he had money to spare. And there
came a parcel of presents for Emmie and the
little girls, by which all were greatly impressed.
Dorastus's rank in the memory of his
family rose a degree. Now, on looking back,
each knew that he had always foreseen how,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
with that powerful will, Dorastus must be
able to hew his way through difficulties and
compel circumstances to serve him. He was
looked on rather as a man than a boy, even
as he looked on himself. His mother was
grateful to him for seeming to efface the
weak foolishness out of her first marriage:
she was justified in her latter days, and
proved a virgin full of good sense. She
wrote Dorastus encouraging letters. Her
good words got glowing answers: surely it
would not be long; he was working with all
his might. But they must be patient, for
success as a material recompense was slow;
and he hinted with the effect of a sigh at
rivalries, at the density of the public mind.
Yet talent must inevitably triumph in the
end and manly effort meet its reward.</p>

<p>When Hector came home for his holidays
he found it just a little stupid to have been
a good boy. The personage in the general
mind seemed to be his undisciplined half-brother.
He contrived, however, in the
course of weeks, to fix a good deal of attention
on himself. He restored the balance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
his mother's mind. Dorastus sank into his
natural place in relation to her other children.
She waited in serene patience&mdash;sometimes
with a passing touch of scepticism, the reflection
of some outsider's attitude, oftener with
childish perfection of faith&mdash;for the developments
he announced in letters somewhat decreasing
in frequency, but preserving their
early tone of hopefulness.</p>

<p>So time passed. The unusual became the
usual and lost consideration, according to its
habit.</p>

<p>Then the sisters-in-law, those perfect
daughters, mothers, and wives, came to visit
the head of the house in the home of their
girlhood. They brought maids and children
and chattels manifold.</p>

<p>Now these ladies had been in London, and
Emmie heard much from them of the glories
and greatness of that city; she had long opportunity
to learn respect for their manners
and gowns, which alike came from there.
They had not happened upon Dorastus; they
could not remember hearing of him, and as
that seemed to make it plain to Emmie they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
had not been in the most polite places, they
explained that the city was so large and populous
you might not come across a person in
a lifetime.</p>

<p>They left on a rainy autumn morning.
Emmie, with her forehead against the glass,
watched their carriages dwindling, dwindling.
Gone, with all their patterns for gowns, with
the last sweet thing in worsted-work; gone,
with their fashionable conversation, the art
of which she had not had quite time yet to
master. But even if she had become perfect
in all, as they, of what use could it have been
to her here? she asked, turning from the
dripping window-pane.</p>

<p>She moved with an air of being the moon
by day. The sickness of the decaying year
seemed to have got into her blood; she felt
as if she herself were the perishing summer,
which had somehow been wasted. She said
over her children's ages with a sort of terror,
a sense of time having stolen a march on her;
she was vaguely panic-stricken to think there
was so little of the good time of life left before
her. She sought the mirror to divert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
her mind with trying on again the bonnet
the sisters had bestowed on her, pronouncing
it so becoming. Under the severe gray light
the face she saw reflected held more than
ever to her discontented eyes a forecast of
the cheerless coming days when the rose
should be withered, the gold gone. The
deadly quiet of the country, the silence of
the well-regulated house, suddenly seemed to
her an outrage, a roof incontrovertible that
no one cared what happened to her. Gregory
in particular did not care. Else would
he not have comprehended that movement
and novelty and gayety alone could at this
pass save her from the insidious oncreeping
evil that encouraged hard lines between
the pale cheek and the drooping mouth?
Clearly he did not care. He cared for
nothing but not to be disturbed after dinner.
In this connection she thought over
many a subtle wrong she had been putting
up with for years. She thought of Dorastus,
from whom this husband, with his
royal indifference, allowed her to be so long
separated; Dorastus, who as she looked to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
him, turning from the lukewarm, apathetic
tribe surrounding her, seemed an embodiment
of swiftness and strength, a tempered
steel blade to rely on, a flame at which to
warm the numb hands of the heart. Ah,
well, he was making a home for her with him,
yonder in the living city. She lost sight of
the mirror into which she was staring; she
saw that home. Suddenly it seemed to her
she could not live longer without seeing her
boy. She rose with the energy of true inspiration.
It was such an obviously legitimate
desire, this desire to behold again her
own flesh and blood, that she need not be
at pains to fabricate palliation or excuse for
it. She sought Gregory directly. She was
weary and ill, she had dreams at night, he
did not know how hard her life had become.
She wanted to see Dorastus.</p>

<p>Gregory yielded.</p>

<p>They came to London. They took rooms
at a quiet hotel known to him of old.</p>

<p>The novelty of all, the anticipation, made
Emmie feel young again. Her violet eyes
were still childishly clear, her hair was pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
still; little was missed of the beauty of her
youth but its slender lightness.</p>

<p>"No, no; you must leave it all to me,"
she said, when Gregory would have accompanied
her in her search for Dorastus. "I
have a clue which I will not betray. He has
shown, dear fellow, that he might be trusted
to take care of himself. I will bring him
home to dine with us. You may take seats
for the pantomime."</p>

<p>So the good Gregory put her in the care of
a trusted driver, and saw her started on her
adventure.</p>

<p>Now she was driven&mdash;it seemed to her
they were hours on the way&mdash;to the Tartar's
Head, a coffee-house of not very imposing
appearance, in a crowded part.</p>

<p>Before reaching her destination she almost
wished she had let Gregory come: it was so
noisy; the air was so dingy it deadened
one's spirits despite wealth of delightful
prospects; and she must face various unknown,
perhaps unfriendly, faces before finding
his face&mdash;after which all would be well.</p>

<p>She descended from the carriage with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
little flutter, then with the haste of rout got
into it again, and requested the driver to
bring some one to her, as if she had been a
great person.</p>

<p>A young man came out to take her commands,
a well-oiled young man in side-whiskers
and a broad shirt-front.</p>

<p>Had not letters been received there addressed
to so-and-so?</p>

<p>The young man was more than polite.
Inquiries were made. Such letters had been
received. The person to whom they were
addressed called for them.</p>

<p>"I am his mother," said Emmie, lamely,
for she had prepared another course than
this simple one, a course involving strategy.
"Does he not live here? Where does he
live?"</p>

<p>The young man continued very obliging.
He made further inquiries and came back
looking a little blank. The person came himself
and left no direction for forwarding his
letters; a letter had once been waiting several
weeks.</p>

<p>"Does no one here know him?" asked his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
mother, nearly in tears. Of a sudden this city
seemed to her terribly large, and terribly full
of people who cared nothing for any distress
of hers. "He plays on the violin&mdash;he plays
very beautifully on the violin."</p>

<p>A possibility of intelligence dawned in the
obliging young man's face, and he ran in-doors
again. He came back with a hopeful
air. "Yes, your ladyship. There is an old
man belonging to the place knows him. He
took him a letter once when he couldn't
come himself, being laid up. He didn't
want to tell at first, saying how he'd sworn.
But I let him know your ladyship was the
young man's mother, and he told. It's a
bit far."</p>

<p>The waiter stepped up to the coachman
and gave him instructions. Emmie rewarded
his obligingness with bounty in proportion
to her relief at all proving so easy. Of
course some one knew him. It was part of
his boyishness to suppose he could hide,
after his light had begun shining through
the bushel, too.</p>

<p>She looked out through the misty pane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
at the bright passing shop-windows; there
seemed to her thousands in a row, and hundreds
of carriages rolling along with her.
She liked the city again exceedingly, and
was glad to hope she might be there often
after a time; it was so various, it put life
into one. If only the murky cloud would
lift that rested on the chimney-tops, and the
rain stop making more the gray slime on the
flags.</p>

<p>It was a long distance. She looked out
until she was tired and confused; then leaned
back and meditated pleasantly for a time,
then looked out again, with a little shock of
disappointment at seeing no more bright
windows.</p>

<p>They were going more slowly; the streets
here were narrow, the air seemed dingier, the
houses and people looked miserable.</p>

<p>She watched with a saddened interest
these that she fixed upon as the poor city-people
in their poor quarters. She was sorry
for them, but she would be relieved when
they were left behind for the gayer thoroughfares,
or the roomier, more cheerful suburbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Now at the entrance of a narrow court the
carriage stopped. She wondered what could
be hindering its progress, and fidgeted while
the coachman left his box and came to the
door. He opened it with a stolid face and held
his finger to his hat, waiting for her to alight.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but"&mdash;she stammered, eying the
poverty-stricken appearance of the place,
"this cannot be it!"</p>

<p>"The directions were clear, ma'am; I've
followed them," said the man, with respectful
firmness. "This is as near as I can get to the
house; there's no room to turn around in
the court."</p>

<p>Emmie leaned back a moment, determined
not to stir from her cushions&mdash;the mistake
was on the face of it too stupid.</p>

<p>The coachman stood waiting, a man of
patience carved in wood. Emmie eyed him
helplessly; then, seeing that the imposing
creature would be satisfied with no less from
her, with the abruptness of impatience she
alighted, and rustled into the dark court, peering
upward for the number.</p>

<p>There it was. She knocked, and listened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
with a heart in which strange things seemed
to be happening. To the capless woman
who opened she stammered a name, looking
for the relief of being told instantly that
none of that name lived there.</p>

<p>"Three pair back, ma'am," said the woman,
who appeared like a cook, actual, past, or
potential. "But he's not in. There's no
telling how soon he will come. What name
did you say? Drastus what? Sibbie-mole?
Oh no, ma'am. Beg pardon. I listened as
far as Drastus, and answered because it's
such a curious name. Ours name is Fenton.
But, let's see. What manner of young man
might yours be? Like a foreigner, with a
large nose and black eyes, and plays the
fiddle, and wears his hair long? Dear me,
ma'am, the very same! His room's three
pair back. You wish to wait for him? This
way, then, ma'am."</p>

<p>Emmie, in whom all processes of thought
had stopped in amazement, followed the
landlady as best she could up three flights
of dark stairs, and entered through the door
flung open for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>They stood in a little room that received
the day through a sky-light. Emmie dropped,
sitting on the edge of the narrow bed and
knotted her little gloved fingers together in
silence. She was so pale that the landlady
felt alarmed and asked if she were feeling ill.
She shook her head, and continued looking
about fearfully and in wonder.</p>

<p>There was little to see, nothing that might
not have belonged to any one in the wide
world as well as to that boy; not one of these
sordid appurtenances reminded her of him,
except the music on the table&mdash;but any fiddler
might have just such music.</p>

<p>She rose to her feet as if jerked by a hidden
string, and walked stiffly towards the
door, saying, "It is evidently not the one.
This one's name is Drastus Fenton, you say.
The one I seek is Dorastus Sibbemol. Good-morning,
ma'am."</p>

<p>But near the door she stopped, her eyes
widening upon an object set upright in the
corner&mdash;a black wooden box, very old, scarred
and worm-eaten, mournfully resembling a
child's coffin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>She went back to the bed, and limply
leaned against the wall. She stared over at
the box, with its peculiar wrought-iron hinges
and handle.</p>

<p>"Has he been here long?" she asked, faintly,
at last, of the blowzy woman who was looking
at her with some concern, and at the same
time, in view of the lady's respectability, trying
to smooth down her untidy hair.</p>

<p>She thought a moment and judged he
might have been there half a year.</p>

<p>Emmie wrung her hands in an aimless way.
She felt little of pain as yet, or indignation;
only vague throes and convulsions of change,
a working of all the atoms in heart and brain
trying to adjust themselves to something
new.</p>

<p>"And he is poor!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Well," said the landlady, exculpatingly,
"we are all poor folks here, ma'am. He
mostly pays his rent&mdash;I don't ask much,
but when he's behind I'm not hard on him.
He's a good lad," she went on, and as she
was a sizable woman, after a gesture of deferential
apology she took a seat, to support her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
in her view of lingering to angle with information
until she caught a little enlightenment.
"A good lad, but that proud! He thinks he'll
be as rich as a dook some day, with his little
fiddle!" She shook her head in compassion
and chuckled fatly over a household joke of
long standing. "He's all right in his head,
ma'am, except on that point. A poor lad
that plays in the streets is none so likely to
pick up a fortune. And such tunes as he
plays! I've always been told I'd an uncommon
ear for a catch, but to catch head or tail
of them is beyond me!"</p>

<p>"He plays in the streets!"</p>

<p>"Yes, poor Dook&mdash;come rain, come shine.
Sometimes he has a good day, sometimes a
bad one; but times is hard&mdash;it's not very good
at best. He's not one of them pretty-impudent
Italian boys with wheedling brown velvet
eyes. He looks too scornful, and despises
folks more than is for his own good. I have
felt hurt at it myself, ma'am, and I may say
I'm not touchy. When I've known that he
was a bit hard up and he looked hollow, and
I've asked him in neighborly to have a bite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
with us, he has answered me almost as if he
hated me for it&mdash;and gone hollow."</p>

<p>His mother drew in her breath sharply.</p>

<p>"Might you be a friend of his?" asked the
landlady. "Once when he was sick abed,
and I came up to say a good word, he got
sociabler than usual, and spoke of a lady,
a lady of quality, who'd heard him play&mdash;I
thought likely it was before he came here
with his coat so seedy&mdash;a lady who thought
he was very fine. Perhaps I don't understand
about fiddle-playing, and he is all he says.
Might you be the lady?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes!" said Emmie, scarcely
knowing what she said.</p>

<p>The landlady looked much interested.
"Well, now, I thought as much, for I don't
think he's any one in the world belonging to
him. He's a good lad, ma'am," she said
again, with a good-natured impulse to make
hay for a fellow-creature while this, possibly
a sun, was shining. "He deserves better
than he gets, if I do say it. He works at
them music-books for hours sometimes, at
night, till the man below is fit to go mad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
But I tell him I can't put out a lodger that
pays more frequent than he, and when I
speak to Drastus he says he'll leave, though
he should have to sleep on the pavement&mdash;he
must play when he pleases. He says
that it's because he can't play as other fiddle-men
do, from a book and in a particular way,
that he can't get nothing to do but play in
the streets. So he must learn, and learn he
will, and he scrapes away like a meeting of
cats on the roof. I'm sorry he's out, ma'am.
What did you want with him, now? Couldn't
I give your message&mdash;or must you wait yourself?"</p>

<p>"I will wait&mdash;I will wait."</p>

<p>"He may not be home till night. He
sometimes even&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, leave me, my good woman!" moaned
Emmie. "What else can I do but wait?"</p>

<p>And the landlady, taking pity on what
seemed to her an inordinate perturbation of
spirit, left the visitor to herself, returning
now and then to listen, and bringing up once
an inquiry from the coachman.</p>

<p>Emmie remained sitting on the edge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the bed. After a time she rose and looked
with pointless minuteness at everything in
the room, opening every drawer and reading
every paper. She found all her letters tied
in a bundle and wrapped in a silk neckerchief
of her own, old, and that she had never
missed. He had few possessions, and they
made the heart sick to pore over.</p>

<p>The light faded off the dull glass overhead.
With chilled fingers she felt for the candle
and lighted it. The landlady, coming up at
dark, insisted on bringing her a cup of tea.
The good creature had so disciplined her
curiosity concerning the history implied in
this gentlewoman's presence here that her
delicacy now in endeavoring to discover was
touching. Yet it went unrewarded. She
stayed for the satisfaction of seeing the lady,
who she thought looked fairly ill, refresh herself;
and when it was delayed, tried by example
to institute in the atmosphere that
cheerfulness which is conducive to a better
appetite&mdash;until asked again, with an imploring
glance from eyes like a shot dove's, to go,
for the sake of pity to go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Emmie now took down the few clothes
she had seen on the hooks, with a vague idea
that they required mending. She spread
them out over her lap one by one, and passed
her hand mechanically over the threadbare
places where the black was green, over certain
fringes about the holes, her heart feeling
extraordinarily large and empty and silent.
The rings on her cold hand glittered in the
stroking movement, four rich rings with
various stones, Gregory's gifts. Four&mdash;but
she had five children.</p>

<p>She stretched herself suddenly on the bed
with her face in the old coat, the chill of the
room slowly seizing upon her as she lay. She
prayed in a distant, half-conscious way, without
the least illusion that such words could
persuade any one, for God to unmake everything
that had happened to her, to let her
have died, and Dorastus too, at his very birth;
for them to have both been lying in the remote
Dutch God's-acre these many years.
For one fleeting moment memory gave back
to her perfect an impression never before recalled.
She seemed to have been roused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
from a stupor deeper than sleep; her eyes
dwelt without wonder on what she thought
to be a cathedral, with colored windows ablaze&mdash;it
dwindled, until it was a mere night-light
glimmering. Then shadowy people placed a
little bundle in her arms. She tingled as an
instrument whose every string is touched, a
coolness rippled from her head to her feet,
she knew a state never known before or since,
a sense of unlimited wealth, a tenderness ineffable,
a trembling outgoing of all her being
to this handful of life. She heaved a great,
faint sigh, and with effort unspeakable bent
till her lips were pressed as to a warm rose-leaf.
She sank to sleep, weak unto death,
but blissfully happy&mdash;waking stronger and
in a different mood.</p>

<p>She wished she might not have waked, but
been buried with her poor first baby in her
arms, having ceased to be in the single moment
wherein she completely loved it. Nothing
that had happened to her since then
seemed to her sweet; all was sicklied through
by the consciousness of a crime gone before
and daily confirmed, a woman's most mon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>strous,
miserable crime&mdash;not loving enough.
Nothing could make her withered, yellowed,
cheapened life right now&mdash;she should have
died at that moment. She said this over and
over again to the powers that hear us, until
all meaning had faded from it. She started,
with a sense of something going out&mdash;she
thought it must be the candle and she should
be left in the dark. She sat up, frightened
and freezing.</p>

<p>The candle was burning quietly. Then, as
she scrutinized the shadows ahead, loath to
stir, she became aware of her rings having
grown loose, they were in danger of dropping
off; of her clothes having grown loose, they
let the cold in under them; she felt a prickling
at the temples, as if it were the gray
creeping through her hair; she felt her features
becoming pinched and old, beauty dropping
from them like a husk. She wanted to
cry then with a childish self-pity, but no tears
would come; she did not know how to start
the flood that she longed for to relieve her.
She felt that she could only have screamed.</p>

<p>She got up to rid herself of this congeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>ment,
and paced the room from corner to
corner with sweeping black gown that told
of the dusty things it had that day brushed.</p>

<p>Company had come to the man below;
they were making a great deal of very jolly
noise. The candle guttered drearily; a reek
of warm cabbage climbed up the stairway to
her nostrils. She looked up on hearing a
soft tapping&mdash;the black sky-light was spattered
with silver tears, like a pall.</p>

<p>She walked up and down, waiting and listening,
everything taking more and more the
quality of a dream wherein the most unnatural
things grow ordinary. She had felt with
a numbed sort of cowardly loathing that every
moment brought her nearer to a black
stream of realizing grief and remorse into
which willy-nilly she must descend; but now
it seemed in accordance with every known
law that she should be here, destined to go
on walking so forever, never arriving, nor
anything ever changing. She heard herself
say aloud in a light, indifferent tone, "He
will never come. He will never come."</p>

<p>For a moment she remembered Gregory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
whose image seemed to rise out of the dim
past: Gregory in the warm light of the hotel
coffee-room, where dinner was set on a little
table for three, dinner with wine-glasses of
two shapes, and fruit and confectionery in
crystal dishes. The thought worked upon
her as a sweet smell in sea-sickness. All
that had to do with Gregory seemed of negative
importance; let him wait and wonder
and worry. She felt hard-hearted towards
him and all prosperous things.</p>

<p>A burst of voices reached her through the
floor; they were rough and hoarse, their
mirth had turned to wrangling. It was so
horribly lonely here! If they were suddenly
possessed to climb the stairs, to burst in
upon her! There was a crash of glass&mdash;she
screamed; then a laugh&mdash;she shuddered&mdash;and
the noise grew less. She breathed again, but,
feeling her knees weaken, went back to the bed,
and sat listening in fascination for the murmuring
sounds to develop again into a quarrel.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without the warning of gradually
approaching sounds she had prepared herself
for, she heard footsteps just outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>She knew them. An impulse to flee seized
her. She looked about for a place to hide
in, a place to get through, to jump from.
She could not bear to see him, she felt as a
murderess whose victim's ghost is upon her.
His image flashed before her, pinched with
hunger and cold, worn, embittered with disappointment,
terrible with its long unrequited
love turned to hatred&mdash;gray, with glassy eyes.</p>

<p>She looked wildly, but she could not move.
Besides, it was too late, a hand was on the
door.</p>

<p>As it opened, a deep stillness fell upon
her, a suspension of all.</p>

<p>A spell seemed to snap with his coming
into the range of the candle-light; it was as
to a child locked all night in a graveyard the
cock-crow that lays the ghosts and heralds
the day. She took a feeble breath and her
heart gave a warm little throb. The very
face! only, a young man's face rather than a
boy's, thinner and bolder than ever, but,
thank Heaven! not pathetic, not heart-breaking&mdash;but
with red where red should be, with
living light in the eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>He held his violin; he was meanly clad,
and his woollen muffler was of a cheap and
dismal tint no mother would have chosen for
him.</p>

<p>He looked in surprise at the lighted candle,
and quickly cast his eyes about, frowning
to see who had taken this liberty. He
caught sight of her, blinked and narrowed
his eyes, to distinguish.</p>

<p>She could not make a sound, or bring a
vestige of expression to her face, or lift the
pale little hands from her black lap&mdash;but sat
transfixed under his questioning stare.</p>

<p>He took a few steps, uttered a jubilant
shout, and dashed towards her with outstretched
arms&mdash;But he stopped before
reaching her. He gave a glance around the
horrible little room, a glance at her face with
the eyes full of stern sadness, of reproach for
the many, many lies he had told her. Abruptly
he turned his back to her and dropped
on his knees beside the table, saying furiously
in disjointed syllables as he pressed his
working face against his arms. "You won't
understand! You never understand any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>thing!
I think sometimes that you are a
fool!"</p>

<p>But he felt her soft icy hands tremble
about his head, he felt her fluttering breath
in his neck. She was kneeling beside him,
saying in choked whispers in the intervals of
lifting her poor lips from his wet face, "Don't
speak!&mdash;Don't speak!"</p>

<p>She was straining him to her with a passionate
tenderness never shown another being,
raining on him the sweetest kisses.</p>

<p>Both fell to crying as if their hearts would
break.</p>

<h2 id="CHLOE_CHLORIS_AND_CYTHEREA">CHLOE, CHLORIS, AND CYTHEREA</h2></div>


<p>To make you acquainted by sight with
young Chloris: she was a tall girl, a trifle
meagre in outline, but not disagreeably so;
she had light reddish-brown hair, and a
sprinkling of freckles on a peachy skin, and
those eyes with dead-leaf spots in them; altogether
an air of openness and intelligent
goodness that had quickly thrown the newly
introduced off the question&mdash;was she pretty?
But she was pretty, too, at her hours.</p>

<p>On this day she had shut out the sun by
means of the green Venetian blinds, and her
room, like a submerged crystal chamber, was
full of a watery light; she herself, white
clothed, made a fair green-shadowy nymph
in the dim green atmosphere.</p>

<p>This was her first hour of complete con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>scious
content. So rich was she in content
that she had set herself to perusing a volume
of the driest essays, a present for a diligent
girl graduate.</p>

<p>This sense of life unfolding like a normal
flower and becoming the perfection of a rose
was too much for the grateful heart to contemplate
at its ease; some great demonstration
towards God must follow on such contemplation.
And Chloris in her security
putting it off until bedtime, sat reading about
the discipline of the will, the happy blood
all the while keeping up in her veins a pleasant
undercurrent babbling of other matters.
Two hours more and the summer sun would
be reaching its glorious haven, the cool flow
in with the darkness, and time take up
again that sweet scanning of the lines of her
idyl....</p>

<p>After reading the same passage some
seven times, Chloris let her book lie a moment
in her lap. How marvellous, how
simple, how natural, how exquisite! Truly
like the coming up of a flower. First, they
were children together, fair-dealing, un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>quarrelsome
playmates; then, schoolboy
and schoolgirl, always good unsentimental
friends; and finally, time, passing over them,
slowly turned them to lovers; for this, no
question, was whither they were tending:
quiet, undemonstrative, unjealous, faithful,
devoted lovers, presently married people,
and by and by, God pleasing, tenants of one
same grave. And this sweetness in the
heart, this best of all earthly goods, God
granted it to the humblest of his creatures!
Why, then, were so many dissatisfied with
this dear earth? Why were some on it interested
in the discipline of the will? Ah,
this summer, so endearingly begun, to be
ended so&mdash;and Chloris, in a confusion of
bliss, almost as if to give herself a countenance
towards herself, took up her book
again, finding moonlight and wild azaleas
and whippoorwills between the lines, a
dappled, singing shingle, a golden beach,
velvet winds from over sea.</p>

<p>The sunshine crept off the window-square;
a sadness instantly invaded the room; Chloris
jumped up to open the blinds. Time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
dress! Then she did her hair as painstakingly
as ably, put on a just-ironed white
gown with a violet figure, and stood at the
glass weighing the question of a velvet band
around the neck. A fateful sound already
was dawning on the distance outside, but
she did not as yet hear it. Too hot! She
tossed the velvet ribbon in the top bureau-drawer
so unconcernedly as if not, at that
moment, the Parc had been tangling the
skein of her life, and wondered idly if any
one describing her would call her pretty.
She thought, in conscience, not; but of a
charming appearance, she hoped any one
would.</p>

<p>At this point penetrated to her brain a
sound of voices out on the road beyond the
lawn and the hedge. She looked between
the curtains.</p>

<p>Two ladies, unknown to her, were slowly
sauntering past in the direction of the beach;
one, near middle age, in a darkish gown; the
other, young, in light colors of a distinctly
fashionable tone; this latter carried over her
shoulder a very large, fluffy, and, as it showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
even at this distance, inexpressibly costly
parasol. She turned her face a moment
on the ancient vine-overclambered country-house,
from one window of which peeped
Chloris, looked it up and down and across,
and turned away, making, Chloris supposed,
some comment upon it to her companion.</p>

<p>When they had disappeared from sight,
Chloris, still at the window, musing on that
face seen a moment, heard a leisurely jingling,
and saw pass at a walking pace an
empty shining carriage, drawn by two superb
bays, driven by a man in livery.</p>

<p>"It must be their turn-out," she concluded
her wondering. "Who can they be but the
people that were to move into the Beauregard
cottage?"</p>

<p>Then, as there was time to spare before
tea, she sat down in the window. Shortly,
was a lively jingling, a trampling, and the
shining carriage bowled swiftly by on its way
back from the beach; on its cushions, two
ladies under a broad lacy parasol; a mighty
cloud of dust running after it, never to over-take.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost at the same moment Chloris saw
Him, half the subject of her idyl, coming
across the lawn.</p>

<p>She went to meet him.</p>

<p>"Who are the arrivals?" she asked at once.</p>

<p>And here was pronounced, for the first time
before Chloris, the name of Cytherea.</p>

<p>"Cytherea, Damon? Who is Cytherea?
Where does she come from? Do you know
her?"</p>

<p>"Very slightly," answered the young man;
"I have met her in town. She had told me
she thought of coming here for the summer,
but I supposed it was conversation. I had
completely forgotten, until I saw her this
afternoon. She is entranced with everything!
You can never see our poky little
old place in its true light: you must get a
description of it from her, Chloris. She will
find it deadly dull before the end of a week;
but for the moment she imagines quiet to be
all she wants. She has been working like a
slave at doing the proper thing in town."</p>

<p>"She has brought her style with her, I
see."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are inseparable. She arrived yesterday
on the late train, and you should see
the change already in the Beauregard."</p>

<p>"You have been there, then?"</p>

<p>"Just a moment. They called to me from
the veranda. They were having tea. Fancy
their bringing down a grand-piano!"</p>

<p>"Does she play much?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Very probably. She
looks as if she might."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Damon! There you mistake.
She looks as if she mightn't. She is very
pretty, but I will vouch for it she can't
play&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps the cousin is the pianist. We
shall see. I said you would call on them
this evening."</p>

<p>"I, Damon? The instant they arrive?
Why did you say that? Why should I call
before they have had time to breathe?"</p>

<p>"Do you mind? I am so sorry. They
asked me to come, and I half promised. It
is likely to be somewhat slow for them here
if we stand on ceremony. You will like them,
I am sure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are sure? No doubt I shall. But
to-night seems rather&mdash;instantaneous, if you
don't mind. You will excuse me to them,
and I will wait till they get a little more
settled."</p>

<p>"Settled! They have brought down an
army of servants. The house looks as if
they had lived in it for a month."</p>

<p>"Make what excuse for me you please,
then."</p>

<p>"You won't come, Chloris?"</p>

<p>"I think not. Not this evening. Go by
yourself, and tell me all the great changes
to-morrow. She will be much better pleased
to see you than me, anyway."</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

<p>"Her face, my dear boy! She can't play
the piano, to speak of, and she greatly prefers
men to women."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you do her an injustice&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have I said anything disparaging? I
signalled two virtues, I think. You don't
really mind my not going, Damon? I had
intended to write letters this evening, and
mend table-cloths and read to father."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>When, shortly after tea, Damon had gone,
Chloris tried to return herself into a truthful
person by reading an hour to her father, and
adding a dozen stitches to a delicate darn,
and writing a note, which, when finished, she
tore up. In order, as far as possible, with
her conscience, she seated herself at the
piano, a poor, tin-voiced instrument, tired of
the sea-air. No one so well as Chloris,
accustomed to its senile vagaries, could
make the worn thing discourse music;
her greatest successes on it were old-time
compositions written in the day of spinet
and harpsichord, minuets with a sprinkling
of grace-notes, things not sonorous or profound.
To-night, playing for no one's praise,
she plunged haphazard into the melodies
most sympathetic at the moment, stormy
and subtle, melancholy and intricate and
modern. It was Chloris's one proud gift,
this effectiveness at the piano.</p>

<p>Her father and his elderly sisters took
themselves off to bed on the stroke of ten.
Chloris remained on the adjustable stool,
relieved at their going. She took up her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
playing again, without trying now to keep
her eyes dry.</p>

<p>The sweet, hot air of the day, cooling, was
turned to dew outside; something of the
same kind seemed taking place within herself&mdash;and
the dew was tears. Why had she
been so curiously uplifted that day, so at rest
concerning every point in life, so sure of one
thing at least? Nothing was changed, yet
she saw no reason now for blessing this summer,
golden hour for hour, and looking to it
for the greatest, serenest happiness. Damon?
What was Damon to her, or she to Damon?
He had never in so many words made love
to her, and she had never felt the first pang
of wonder or disappointment at this. They
had walked, rowed, ridden together. What
of it? They should do these things again a
hundred times, probably. What of that?
What had she been dreaming, erewhile?
Or was this the dream, this bad one? Something
splendid and shining and purple had
gone gray.</p>

<p>While continuing mechanically to play,
she looked through the open window into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the summer night. It was rightfully her
moon, that honeyed bright moon outside;
her balm-breathing night; it was her silver
sea yonder out of sight; they were her
odorous pine-needle paths in the sighing
grove&mdash;and she was robbed of them. And
the sense of it gave her a seething in the
heart, the like of which sensation she had
never dreamed existed: as if a painful separation
of all the atoms in it one from the
other, as well as the stern conviction of being&mdash;oh,
the novel idea!&mdash;a fool.</p>

<p>"I won't have it!" she muttered, emphatically,
without knowing definitely what she
meant, and struck an angry discord.</p>

<p>Through her playing reached her suddenly
that merry harness-jingle of the afternoon,
approaching, passing, fading away.</p>

<p>"There they go&mdash;to the beach for the
second time to-day&mdash;to look at the ocean
by light of the moon."</p>

<p>When in little less than an hour she heard
the breaking again, on the quiet air, of the
fatuous silvery jingle, she let her playing
fall to a mere musical murmur, and lis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>tened,
acutely, burning all the while with
shame.</p>

<p>"Go slowly, Humphrey," she caught, in a
rich, sweet voice; "I want to listen to the
music."</p>

<p>"She plays really wonderfully. I have
never heard playing I preferred to hers,"
came in a well-known deeper voice, at
which Chloris's cheeks waxed hotter still.
She pressed her foot on the pedal and shut
herself within a wall of dinning, buzzing
sound.</p>

<p>When she had lifted it, and risen, the road
was empty, the night silent, but for the crickets
and the distant surf, as the grave.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Several days passed, each bringing Chloris
its very natural request from Damon that
she would go with him to pay her respects
to the new neighbors; but with a perversity
that surprised herself more livelily than him,
she daily found a bad reason for putting off
the duty. This hindered the progress of the
idyl; for Damon had a delicate conscience
where these strangers were concerned; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
would not see them bored in a latitude whose
honor, as an earlier inhabitant, he appeared
to have at heart.</p>

<p>And presently the atmosphere of the whole
country-side seemed qualified by the presence
of this Cytherea. It seemed to Chloris one
could not escape the effect of her, without
taking to the deepest of the woods. She
was like an unstopped jar of some powerful
essence; the little country world was redolent
of her.</p>

<p>Before the time Chloris had at last rigidly
fixed for a formal visit came a message from
Cytherea inviting her. Hard as she sought
to discover a reason for misliking the dainty
note, she could find none; it was irreproachable,
and Chloris dressed herself for the occasion
with a divided mind, the preponderant
part of which was finally comfort: she
should at least grapple now with a reality.</p>

<p>She came to Cytherea's house at evening
under Damon's escort. As one approached
it among the trees it looked rather more like
one's idea of an Eastern temple than a sea-coast
cottage. The veranda was behung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
with colored paper moons, glowing subduedly
among the vines; soft light streamed
through lace from the changed interior.</p>

<p>Excitement took Chloris from herself.
Now the great adversary was welcoming
her; and Chloris, at the touch of a warm,
soft hand, said to herself, "What bugbear
have I been frightening myself with?" and
found ease and ability to converse, and
release from that sense of disadvantage that
had ridden her helpless heart like a nightmare.</p>

<p>This atmosphere of the great world that
went with Cytherea, how awakening, how
satisfying after all, to the mind! Not the
smallness of envy, thought Chloris, should
keep her from giving it its due, or getting
her benefit from it. In the distance and
abstract she had hated it; but entered into,
seen close, how unconscious, how inoffensive,
nay, genial, it proved! What a great good,
too, this wealth that permitted such distinction
in luxury! Country girl as she was, it
seemed to Chloris she was breathing her
native air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>At Cytherea's prayer she sat down at the
piano, and to her own surprise played better
than usual. When she had done, she begged
the hostess to play. She forgot how she
had declared that Cytherea's face showed no
soul for music.</p>

<p>She was surprised to hear the lady say,
"I play hardly at all." She sincerely now
could not believe it.</p>

<p>"Ah, well!" laughed Cytherea; and good-naturedly
she pushed a chair to the piano,
and appeared preparing to begin.</p>

<p>Chloris looked on in some wonder. Cytherea
seated herself half away from the keyboard,
one nonchalant arm over the back of
her chair, her curly forehead on her hand;
and, the first to smile at her own affectation,
played an elaborate waltz, very languidly,
with her left hand.</p>

<p>Impossible for the eyes to leave her a
moment while she performed her pretty
trick; and ably enough she performed it,
with an adorable cream-white hand.</p>

<p>Chloris seemed to be slowly returning to
consciousness. What perfection was here!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Nature had given this creature everything.
Criticism of her could only pass current under
the stamp of envy. That gracious dark
beauty, that warm radiance! And sparkle,
and charm&mdash;with winningness, dignity, rarity,
variousness!</p>

<p>Chloris looked over at Damon; and the
image of his fascinated face, as, a fond forgotten
smile on his lips, he followed with his
dark dog-eyes each movement of Cytherea's,
affected her as a drop of poison let into her
blood. She seemed to herself growing aged
and haggard, even as she sat there, the dancing
measure beating on her ear. Her hands
lay cold in the lap of her best gown&mdash;modest
made-over gown of pale purplish silk that
she wore with a lace bertha of past fashion,
once her poor mother's. "What is the use
of trying to contend with a thing like that?"
her heart asked, dully.</p>

<p>An acuter pain pierced it when, the waltz
played out, the laugh following it laughed
out, and conversation resumed, she realized
the faintest possible shade of disregard in
Cytherea for the observations made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Damon. Cytherea prized her, Chloris's,
utterances distinctly more; her, she seemed,
from all her manner, to be honoring; him,
for some reason, she held a trifle cheap.
This seemed to Chloris just a little more
unendurable than all the rest. And the
dear boy, who, totally ignorant of the effect
he produced, was in such high spirits, was
so anxious to please, so cheerfully making a
mantle in the mud of himself for the beauty
to tread upon.</p>

<p>At last it was over; Chloris lay in her own
bed in the pale summer darkness, and felt
she was the heart of the created world, and
this pain man's old inheritance; it seemed
the very essence of her being which was distilled
slowly from her eyes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the day following, Chloris punctually
sought Cytherea, for appreciation must be
shown the cordiality of the beauty. That
was a question apart from others: one is
just and polite before anything else. A
person overhearing the chatting and laughing
of that afternoon in Cytherea's room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
would have thought certainly he listened to
a pair of heart friends. The greater expense
of admiration between the two women
seemed of a truth to be borne by Cytherea.
Chloris must look herself mentally over in
astonishment at this value set on her by so
great a judge. After the examination she
felt foolish and humble. She felt profoundly
how, all being different, she too could have
worshipped Cytherea.</p>

<p>And now she must be concerned in every
sort of rural festivity organized by Damon
for Cytherea's amusement; she must see
the rival's first effect of being mildly bored
by Damon's whole-souled dedication turn
into an effect of indulgence, daily tinged
with increased liking; for who in nature could
fail to do final justice to one so simple, so sincere
as Damon&mdash;Damon, with his dear, clear,
curiously gentle Roman face and curly hair?</p>

<p>"The heat does not seem to agree with
you this summer, child," one of the aunts
concluded her kindly meant scrutiny of
Chloris's face; and the girl's heart tightened
with affright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>She stood that day before the glass, and,
leaning her elbows on the bureau, seriously
examined the tinted shadow. "All is of
no use," she said. "The more I care, the
more I must look like that. Does it not
seem a little strange that the more one loves
the less lovely one should become? And a
little hard, too, perhaps, oh, you, my God,
with all respect, who have arranged these
little matters?" And tired, discouraged
Chloris began weakly to laugh aloud, though
she was alone; and watched the grimacing
of her own reflection with a sort of brutal
contemptuousness. "Oh, you sickening
object!" she exclaimed, and hid the delicate,
nervous, tell-tale face in her hands. "This
cannot go on!" she raved. "Human flesh
cannot endure it&mdash;and I cannot alter it.
All must soon see how it is with me. I can
barely keep a hold on my temper now. I
must get away. Damon shall court her;
she shall bloom and smile at her ease for
him. Welcome to each other&mdash;both! I
shall be where I cannot see it. I refused to
visit Fidele in her mountain home. I had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
use already&mdash;God help me!&mdash;for every hour
of the summer. I will write to say I repent.
Then Damon, Cytherea, sing duets out in
the canoe by moonlight; find clover-leaves
for each other. I shall be scouring the
mountain in search of healing herbs, and I
do not doubt but, God helping, I shall find
them. It is not in nature that a torture like
this should last!"</p>

<p>And Chloris, when next she appeared before
the public eye, looked almost triumphant.
And when her leave had been taken
of all, and the swift air of change was blowing
against her brow, her heart felt so strangely
sound and quiet that she almost laughed,
asking herself, "Why am I going away? I
am recovered merely at the notion of it.
Had I but known, I could have remained
like a little heroine, and stood it out."</p>

<p>But the hours passing broke down and
carried off more and more all the gallant
props of pride and resolution, and at last
Chloris sat in the galloping car, a drooping
runaway, who looked steadily out of the window,
and saw the flying scene through tears.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Contemptible, countrified Chloris, with her
freckles and inferior clothes, and so ordinary
notions of conduct and taste, running away
from comparison with the peerless Cytherea;
taking her envy and weakness out
of sight till she got strength to disguise
them.</p>

<p>Now the scenery, which she had not been
seeing, became more lonely and wild; the
first low hills, heavy and slow in the general
nimbleness of things, shifted themselves with
an amiable clumsiness till they had closed in
Chloris with her train; waking her suddenly,
with a faintly happy sense of diversion
from immediate suffering, to the feeling of
being a child again visiting strange countries.
Then wheeled and tumbled themselves
about and came to meet her the little hills'
big brothers, the mountains, with velvety
sides, and rocky, rosy summits. A weight
for no reason seemed to melt away from
Chloris's chest as she looked up at them,
and thought of living among them now for
many a day&mdash;the distinguished, sage, cool,
sturdily benevolent ones, so high above, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
far from, the world she knew, down on the
hot-colored, populous plain.</p>

<p>Here she was at last, where she must
alight; in a high, pure, crystal-clear atmosphere,
at a little lost place, wildly green to
eyes used to the sun-burned shore, forgotten
of all the world but this train that remembered
it for a second twice a day.</p>

<p>And here was Fidele! It seemed to
Chloris she had not half known, until this
moment, how fond she was of Fidele. Tears
sprang to her eyes on meeting the familiar
eyes, and she embraced her old school friend
with an impulse of overflowing gratitude.
She felt like a storm-beaten lamb come to
some sort of shelter at last.</p>

<p>After the first moment's frantic clutch
the two friends stood apart, holding hands,
and looking each other fondly and frankly
over, with wide, moved smiles. Fidele, seeing
Chloris's eyes, wondered why tears had
not come to her, too; and compared her
own nature unfavorably with her friend's
rich nature; and at this thought of her
friend's deep, sweet nature, behold! tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
were come in her affectionate eyes, too.
Then both girls fell to giggling like schoolgirls,
from mere association of this meeting
with other meetings; and in a moment were
talking lightly and inconsecutively, in an
involuntary imitation of old days; and
Fidele had taken her friend's arm tightly
under her own, intertwined their fingers, and
was dragging her along at a hop-and-skip
pace.</p>

<p>"What a godsend you are to me!" she
exclaimed, rapturously. "There is not a
soul in this forsaken place to whom one can
talk like a Christian. Oh, but we are slow!
Oh, but we are primitive! Oh, but we are
simple!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What air it is!" Chloris breathed, profoundly.
"How sweet! I never dreamed
such green!&mdash;My dear, this is Paradise!"</p>

<p>"The air is good enough. The grass is
certainly green. But oh, the people are
green too! But now you are here, we will
change all this, dear. What a holiday!
You will inspire us. We will rise up, and
look into our closets, and fetch out where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>with
to make a good impression on the
stranger. You bring the very air of civilization
with you in your clothes and hair.
Where did you get it, Chlo&mdash;the general
air, you know? How ravishingly you do
your hair! And that little hat! Now,
who in the world but you would have a
hat like that? Oh, you rare darling! Do
you know you are greatly improved? You
are thinner, but it suits you. You always
were a beauty, you know. Yes, you were!
But you have acquired so much besides&mdash;such
an interesting air&mdash;yes, you have!&mdash;so
much expression. No one could see you
without&mdash;gospel truth, Chlo! But, yes&mdash;I
will&mdash;I will hold my tongue. Did you bring
your music at least, for there is a piano, such
as it is. Thank Heaven! You shall make
their capture with song. They shall grovel.
You know, dear, I am not really so silly as I
seem; your arriving has turned my head.
I always did adore you, but it is even better
than I remembered."</p>

<p>Chloris that night, alone at last, tried
to readjust herself, to get back through this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
new experience her self of yesterday. The
morning of her starting from home, but sixteen
hours removed, seemed withdrawn into
a much remoter past; a screen of glittering,
crumbling, changing color was arisen between
herself and it. She interrogated her breast
curiously for that pain lately grown so familiar,
forgotten for the first time only in these
last hours; her breast did not answer by at
once producing it. She goaded it tentatively
with a sharp memory or two; it responded
sluggishly&mdash;a divinely restful torpor was
possessing it. She knelt by the window,
and looked out at the still, strong, black
mountains; instinctively she wafted profound
thanks to their rude majesties. Far,
far away in her dream at this moment, in
an infinitely small, sun-warmed, murmuring
plain, moved two tiny figures: the great
Damon, who erewhile filled the entire horizon
of her life, and the great Cytherea, who
interposed her fair shape between her and
the sun, shutting off the light of life&mdash;two
tiny black figures, in a far-off, sunshiny place
it fatigued her to think of. Only the moun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>tains
were big and important; and this cool,
rough bedchamber was fifteen by twelve;
only Fidele and herself and the people
seen for the first time this evening were
life-size and real.</p>

<p>Stretching her tired limbs in the bed, that
had nothing to-night in common with the
rack, feeling natural sleep creep over her as
it had long not done, she remembered with
a vague joy that she was young; she divined
a time ahead&mdash;perhaps not so far ahead
either&mdash;when life would become possible
again.</p>

<p>She felt as if cosily tucked in and kept
warm by the sense of Fidele's affectionate
appreciation, and the evident admiration of
her friends, called in even on this first evening
to greet her. It was good. It restored
one's lost self-confidence.</p>

<p>The last thought Chloris was conscious of
was not for Damon this once, but Demetrius.
(Demetrius, I said. The reader here revolts.
Chloris, Cytherea, a Chloe apparently still to
come, and Fidele, Damon, Demetrius! Are
these names to pass off on the discriminating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
reader in a tale that has nothing to do with
the times of Theocritus or Addison? I confess
it, I would have deceived. The persons
in this story knew themselves by none of the
names I have set down. They had been
given at the font, and had by chance and inheritance
come into, names that represented
them far less well. Who can assume to fitly
name a babe in arms? With a pure purpose
I rechristened them. If you could know
what, for instance, was the real name of Cytherea&mdash;But
enough.)</p>

<p>On the next morning arises Chloris, constating
with thankfulness that no more than
the night before is her heart bleeding at
every pore. Filled with a venerable feminine
desire to still increase the favorable impression
she is sure she has made on the inhabitants
of this high hamlet, she does her hair
more than ever engagingly, puts on her
crispest white gown with the lavender ribbons,
and her broad straw hat with roses&mdash;the
hat Damon had praised in the early part
of the season. Something stirs in her sleeping
bosom at the remembrance; she pauses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
in her task of pinning it on; the green-gray
eyes with the brown spots grow fixed upon
a vision, small as if seen through the wrong
end of the opera-glass: On a shining shore,
two little figures setting out in a sail-boat&mdash;only
two, for the cousin has pleaded the disagreeable
effect on her of the motion of the
sea. Chloris sits down discouraged, feeling
the blood drop from her face, and her heart
present her with as finished a pain as ever.
"It really matters so very little," she murmurs,
firmly restraining from wringing her
hands; "I only&mdash;only should like to know
how long this kind of thing may be supposed
to last!"</p>

<p>Chloris and Fidele loiter about the garden
full of morning sunshine, snipping off wet
sweet-peas and roses, and reminding each
other of things. Then, to please Chloris,
they go for a stroll. Chloris is eager for a
little climb. Heated and pleasantly tired,
they come to the top of an eminence and
sit down under the only clump of trees, in
company of the unbudging horned cows,
who know their claim is good, for they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
got there first. Fidele, leaning against a
tree-trunk, fans herself more and more fitfully
with her hat, and presently slumbers.
Chloris, with her head in Fidele's lap, can
never weary of looking off over the faint-hued
valley which the shadows of clouds softly
overstray. In this delicious bodily relaxation
after hill-climbing in the sun, strange
peace inundates her soul, and she entertains
a superstition that it is flowing out to her
from the mountains, and lies luxuriously,
letting herself be done good to. "They
know the secret of peace," she muses in her
manner of a girl. "They cannot speak, but
the effect of their knowledge radiates from
them, and reaches us. The end of all&mdash;of
all is peace. All works towards it incessantly,
as one sees nature do towards harmony.
Through these battles, to peace.
Why can one not remember it down on the
plain?" Now a cloud obscures the sun that
gropes through it with long golden fingers;
Chloris, dreaming, ponders half wistfully
what it would be to remain here always,
begin life anew, never return where one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
had suffered so much, and was surely so little
missed!</p>

<p>On their way home the girls meet Demetrius
in his chaise, on his rounds. He reins
in, and leans out of the leathern hood; with
arms alink the girls stand in the white road
below, in a great bath of light. They converse
a moment; Chloris's lifted face, with
the stamp on it still of her high thinking on
the hill-top, is like a flushed pearl under her
rose-laden hat.</p>

<p>"You must let me show you the country,"
says Demetrius, before driving on.</p>

<p>When he is gone, Chloris and Fidele naturally
fall to talking of him.</p>

<p>"How is it," says Chloris, "that a man so
superior has attained his age and is merely
a doctor in a place like this?"</p>

<p>"My dear, we have our ailments like the
rest. You don't grudge us a good doctor?
He was born here, and after a good number
of years down in the haunts of men came
back in a natural sort of way. His father
left him property up here. He is not ambitious;
he has an abundance of money. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
practises more or less for the love of it, and
something to do. He is our most presentable
man, and I want you to appreciate our
good points in him. He adores music; the
piano I spoke of is his. He has invited us up
there; as soon as you feel inclined we will go."</p>

<p>When, in a few days, Chloris consented to
go, one-half the curious population went with
her, to hear her play.</p>

<p>The stiff farm-house parlor, closed nine-tenths
of the year, had been made to breathe
out its musty ice-house atmosphere; lighted
and garnished and filled with guests, it
scarcely recognized itself.</p>

<p>Demetrius leaned on the instrument while
Chloris played, his untrimmed head dreamily
drooping, his eyes half closed, like a lazy
cat's in the sunshine, when a hand is stroking
it the right way. When she had finished,
and all lifted their hands and praised and
questioned her, he turned away with a sigh,
saying nothing; and yet both knew that the
truest music-lover of all was he; and when
she played again it was chiefly with the
thought of him as an audience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>"What an air of intelligence your hands
have when you play," he said, later. "But
it is the same when you are crocheting, or
just drumming on the chair-arm. They look
as if they could talk, and utter such wise and
witty things."</p>

<p>A very friendly understanding was almost
at once established between them; after
which, he being such a sensible, direct, humorous
man, well on towards middle age,
and Fidele urging it, it seemed but proper
to accept the offered seat in his chaise and
see the country to the best advantage.</p>

<p>They travelled many leagues behind his
mare; they reached many points of vantage
from which to look off at the view. Their
conversation was half laughter; yet Chloris
felt a serene security in the awe she knew
she inspired.</p>

<p>In the country doctor's company, such was
his effect on her and hers on him, Chloris
felt always sweetly young, and unusually
well-dressed, unusually beautiful and brilliant&mdash;as
well as experienced in the ways of the
world, and possessed of a strong and compli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>cated
character. With all this, something of
an impostor.</p>

<p>After many rides, many conversations,
the light about Demetrius was insensibly
changed, and offered him under a different
aspect. What genuine kindliness in his
rather heavy yet well-featured face! what a
good, sane, comprehensive intelligence under
his shaggy hair! and under his country-made
waistcoat a heart suspected to be tender and
faithful! If he had done little, risen little,
circumstances were more to blame than will;
and it pierced through his mockery of himself
sometimes that he was not all satisfied
now with his condition; ambition that had
slumbered gave signs of waking. And he
was still young enough to mould his fate to
a different shape.</p>

<p>Chloris, regarding him, as she told herself,
merely in the light of a specimen in which
to study human nature, concluded that the
woman who intrusted her happiness to Demetrius,
at least in the event of her being a
superior creature, would be in the main a
very fortunate one. Nothing to fear in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
man from inconstancy; no account to make
with the inflammable imagination of youth;
the gracious, condescending woman would get
unbounded gratitude from his humility for
every little favor shown. Her life would be
so peaceful, so guarded from all trouble that
care can keep at bay, so surrounded with
delicate consideration.</p>

<p>So the herds-grass purpled and was mown;
the mustard yellowed, and its yellow vanished;
and the apple began to redden.
Then Demetrius, with a little help from
everybody, gave a party&mdash;a party the like
of which had not been given in the sleepy
place since his sister's marriage a dozen years
before; but this Chloris from afar, as Fidele
had foretold, was inspiring the natives.</p>

<p>And undoubtedly she was the queen of
the party. To see her was to know as much.
She wore a grand gown of pale purplish silk,
with a real lace bertha (the talk of the place
for nine days after), and white flowers pricked
into the shiny structure of her hair.</p>

<p>There was hired music, and dancing on
the waxed kitchen-floor, and an opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
never surpassed in the annals of the neighborhood
to get enough of good things to eat.</p>

<p>Towards the end, when one-half the simple
revellers were gone, and the musicians were
silenced with feeding, and the night air
breathed in at the open windows with a feel
of great lateness in it, came a petition to
Chloris to play a piece on the piano.</p>

<p>After various laughing negatives, yielding,
Chloris, whose eyes were lightsome and
dancing to-night, pushed away the stool,
and, substituting for it a chair, sat a little
sideways in this, with one arm over the
back; and, a curious little smile playing on
her lips, propped her ruffled head with its
wilted flowers on her right hand; and, while
the country innocents exchanged wondering
glances, with her nimble left hand, amply
sufficient to the task alone, began playing a
waltz&mdash;a sweet, dreamy waltz.</p>

<p>When they were at last home, and Fidele,
half undressed, had come in to chat a moment
with her friend, she asked, "Did you
enjoy yourself, dearie?"</p>

<p>"Immensely!" said Chloris. "How nice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
they all are to me! What dear, kind things
they are! By the way, though, there was
something I wanted to ask. Who is that
dark-haired, plump young woman, with black
bugle eyes, and a skin like red-and-white
paper&mdash;quite passable-looking, if she did not
look so sulky?"</p>

<p>"What did she wear?"</p>

<p>"Something pretentious but unbecoming.
It had a lot of bead-trimming. Now, speaking
of how nice every one and everything
was, I except that girl's manner. <i>She</i> was
positively rude. I did not know how to
take it. I have met her before, with all the
others, and passed her on the road, bowing
my best; but we have never more than exchanged
a word or two, so I can have done
nothing to offend her."</p>

<p>Fidele was laughing.</p>

<p>"Who is she?" asked Chloris.</p>

<p>"That is Chloe," replied Fidele.</p>

<p>"Chloe?"</p>

<p>"You mustn't mind her rudeness, dearie.
She is really a good sort of creature. But
she is no doubt sorely tried."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"What tries her? Why do you laugh?"</p>

<p>"Demetrius! He was a shade partial to
her before you came&mdash;not enough to cause
comment in any place but this. And, even
here, not enough to lay himself open to
blame. It is a pity, though, that she can't
keep her feelings hidden, and must vent
her spite on you. Silly thing! I have no
patience with that kind of girl."</p>

<p>Chloris's fingers became absent among the
hair they were braiding. She looked into the
lamp-flame with a vacant expression.</p>

<p>Fidele plied the brush in her tangled locks,
and went on chatting.</p>

<p>Suddenly Chloris, who for some time had
not spoken, laughed.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?" asked Fidele, looking
up at her friend, where she stood still staring
in the lamp-flame. "Have I said anything
funny?"</p>

<p>"No, it was nothing you said. I was
thinking&mdash;my mind travelled from one thing
to another&mdash;you know how it jumps about&mdash;and
I had to laugh, before I knew, at a stupid
old circumstance&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"What circumstance?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, dear&mdash;a thing we learned in
school, in French, a fable&mdash;never mind!"</p>

<p>"A fable! My dear Chloris, how interesting!
What fable?"</p>

<p>"I can't quote it. I have forgotten my
French. It was about a hare&mdash;a hare who
ran away in terror of a bull, and in his flight
came to a swamp where the frogs were just
as much afraid of him. Wouldn't it be
interesting to know the rest? What the
hare did, whether he put on his fiercest outside,
and tried to make the frogs quake in
their little wet boots?"</p>

<p>"What nonsense, you dear idiot! Ask
Demetrius! He will give his best consideration
to the frog question, and be impressed
with its profoundness, while Chloe wears
bead trimming and grows sage-color. Good-night,
dear. I am dreadfully sleepy."</p>

<p>"I mean you shall take me to call on
Chloe some day soon. Now that I see her
face with a different idea of her, it is a nice
face! Poor child! I could never settle down
contentedly under the notion that some one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
disliked me; could you? Even a dog! I
have had such a happy, peaceful time here,
in this dear little place, I want every one to
feel kindly towards me when I leave."</p>

<p>"You speak as if I were going to let you
go, Chloris."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dearest, I don't want to talk of it.
I have put off talking of it, day after day,
yet you must know that I can only stay a
very little longer. Think of it! I came for
a month, and I have stayed&mdash;how long is it?
And father must be getting lonesome; and
he so seldom writes, and then tells me little
or nothing. And everything must be needing
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You extraordinary girl!" exclaimed Fidele,
now very wide awake; "I swear I absolutely
do not understand you! What do you
mean? First you seem&mdash;you seem&mdash;and
then&mdash;and then suddenly&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fidele could not get out her words, for
Chloris's hand was across her lips.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she pleaded, quite earnestly.
"Say nothing about it! When a thing has
been spoken it seems to exist! You don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
understand&mdash;I don't understand either.
Who is consistent? Who knows what he
wants? Who knows ever what he is doing?
How many creatures we crush just walking
across the grass! A path opens ahead, we
take it blindly, not knowing whither it leads.
With good reason we say we grope in the
dark. Let us have the grace, then, when a
moment's illumination is granted us, to go
by its light. You don't know what I mean;
I scarcely know myself. But don't try to
keep me, dear! Remain at my side every
minute that is left of my stay here; see me
to the train without the shadow of an adventure&mdash;and
I will love you all my life!"</p>

<p>And a few days later the train that had
brought Chloris picked her up again, all
flushed with Fidele's last kisses, and flew
with her homeward.</p>

<p>She looked out of the window with other
eyes than those she had first turned upon
the mountains. Yet tears were in them, too,
as she said, "Good-bye, dears! Your little
sister leaves you, made quite well again.
But never will she cease to love you. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
shall be always in her dreams. And she
will come back one day. When God sends
her sorrows she will take refuge again with
you."</p>

<p>All through the first hours of being rushed
along across the brilliant fading land, that
she looked at, scarcely seeing, she retained a
sense of exaltation. She seemed to herself
as a sword after the proofs of furnace and
ice-brook. She could have laughed to think
of the philosopher that was going home in
place of the pallid victim of an almost pathological
sensibility.</p>

<p>The mountains were dwindling to little
hills; the latter-year sun was too barely
bright: a crude earth-color and a sombre
green took place of the angelic vague green
and blue and pink of the dewier, earlier
period. The plain was opening with its more
trivial detail. Chloris's mind descended to
its level, and projected itself with a limited
emotion into the circumstances of the approaching
home-coming. She felt prepared
to endure whatever awaited her with grace
and dignity; she felt sure, indeed, that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
should feel very little. "I have learned the
secret of life," she said to herself; "I have
weighed and measured everything."</p>

<p>At this same moment an elderly gentleman
who had a daughter was thinking how
touchingly young and inexperienced his
fellow-traveller looked; in his old heart he
felt sorry for her, somehow, for being so
young.</p>

<p>"I have weighed and measured everything,"
she said. "God is real, God lasts,
and the love of Him. Human passion
passes away. One might almost say that it
does not exist. It is like a physical pain:
it tortures, you try to locate it, you fix your
mind upon the presumed seat of it&mdash;it is not
there, there is no pain; and presently, when
you are well, you cannot call up a remembrance
of the sensation. I feel fitted to
write a book on this subject. I thought I
could never endure my life without Damon&mdash;dear,
dear Damon! Yet I live and am
improved in health. And, blinded by I shall
never be able to explain what mist, I was
beginning to adapt my mind to the thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of life with Demetrius, whom I pictured out
of all proportion happy and grateful to me.
Why more grateful than another? Thank
God I was delivered from committing such
a blunder! Ah, if I could teach Chloe all
that I have learned! But she does not need
it; she gets what she wants, for beyond a
doubt Demetrius in time goes back to her.
I&mdash;I am armed now at every point. I have
a defence against every circumstance. The
secret is: Nothing matters, but God above.
And, knowing this, I mean to be very sweet
to all at home, more thoughtful of every one,
more generous of all myself&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was running between familiar orchards
and fields; the image of reaching home became
very present, and a sweetness pervaded
her rising excitement at the thought of touching
so soon the home-hands. The mountains
were thrown back to the horizon of her mind.
Between the sandy hummocks, beyond the
level salt meadows which she had left green
and found russet, she caught glimpses of a
great sapphire line. She began looking
eagerly for the farm-house that meant she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
was within a minute of her journey's end.
It flashed past. She gathered up her things;
she came out on the platform, and with a
joyous heart looked for her father's gray face
and his hand extended to help her down.</p>

<p>He was not there, and she got off the train
alone, half-conscious of a dog-cart not far,
with a horse behaving as a horse should not
at the locomotive. The superbly indifferent
iron monster puffed off, dragging after it its
train; the indignant horse quieted down.
She heard her name called; the voice was
the man's in the dog-cart, it was Damon's.
The philosopher hurried towards him with
an insanely beating heart, an uplifted, greeting,
beaming face.</p>

<p>He helped her in, and his trickle of answers
met her stream of questions, and her stream
of answers his trickle of questions, as they
jogged, tilting along between the dusty roadsides.
The warm flood of her home-coming
sensations subsided a little, and she turned
to look at him, to take a fond inventory of
his face&mdash;dear old faithful friend, so kind to
fetch her himself! Her heart tightened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
What was gone wrong with Damon?&mdash;Damon,
whom she had been picturing so
happy, and was just rousing her spirit to
question casually concerning Cytherea.
Even at that moment they were approaching
her dwelling, when the question, if she
could make her voice right, not too indifferent,
nor yet too interested, would seem so in
place.</p>

<p>The grass on the lawn was long and uneven,
constellated with twinkling autumn
dandelions; the windows were shuttered, the
veranda was empty, the chimney smokeless;
a forgotten hammock rope, blackened and
twisted by the rain, swung from a branch in
front of the deserted house, thumping faintly
against the tree-trunk. Chloris turned
her lengthened face towards Damon; he
lifted to hers a pair of very miserable eyes,
and said, in an unresonant voice, "You
should have got back in time for the cattle-fair.
It was better than usual this year.
Cookson's little mare took a prize."</p>

<p>"You don't mean it!" faltered Chloris,
and looking straight ahead set her lips hard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
to keep down an impetuous flood of hatred
for Cytherea.</p>

<p>She saw the propriety of continuing to
talk; but she could not keep her mind on it.
Damon's powers of conversation, too, had
failed him. He kept a stolid face to the
horse's head; and they drove in silence to
her door, where, alighting, she was swallowed
in a sea of affectionate fatherly and auntly
embraces.</p>

<p>"I may stay to tea, mayn't I?" asked
Damon, dully, from his corner, where he
seemed sitting in the cold.</p>

<p>Chloris gave him a place beside herself,
and treated him like a sick, beloved child;
but so tactfully, he could know only that it
soothed.</p>

<p>She let him lie on the sofa, afterwards,
while she played, and the others slept in the
upper chambers.</p>

<p>She played with upturned face, pale and
gentle and full of understanding; her eyebrows
lifted, her eyes very large and kind.
She would have thought that Damon slept,
but that now and again he sighed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>When at last she stopped to look for something
among her music, to go on with, he got
up and came to the piano-side. "I am so
glad you have got back," he said, from all his
heart; "you are such a brick. Good Lord,
how I have missed you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned away and went aimlessly to the
window, and stood looking out. "I suppose
it is time I went," he said. "But I hate to
go home! I don't know what is come to me,
I can't sleep these nights."</p>

<p>Chloris had gone to the window, too, and
stood beside him, her indulgent young face,
that wore a world-old expression, turned on
the dimly glimmering white petunia-beds
outside.</p>

<p>"Would you&mdash;won't you come out for a
little stroll, Chloris? Run for your shawl,
there is a dear girl, and let us go over to the
beach. It isn't really late, and I am so restless,
and I don't want to go alone, and it is
so stuffy in my room at home."</p>

<p>Chloris, without a word of demur, took
her wrap and followed him. They walked
side by side in silence; the sense they must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
have in common of the beauty of the night
might at first take lieu of conversation;
when that sense must be outworn, they still
thought their thoughts in silence. Chloris
knew the relief it is not to pretend; Damon
thought only of himself in this hour.</p>

<p>It was she, after a while, that led&mdash;tall,
slender figure a step ahead of him, walking
swiftly, with a sort of intrepidity. With his
head a little bowed, his hands behind him,
he followed.</p>

<p>She led him to the beach, and without
regard for time or fitness of things, farther
and farther along the smooth sands, away
from home; then, by a long loop, back to
the homeward road, as if with the determination
to tire him out. She herself was conscious
of no fatigue. She felt like a spirit;
her uplifted eyes seemed so expanded that
they could take in all the radiant firmament.</p>

<p>At last, as if awaking, he stopped and
vaguely looked about, saying, "I am ready
to drop! Good Lord, how far have you
been taking me? Let us sit down a moment
and rest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>They were not far from home, on the edge
of a familiar pine-grove that ran down to the
lapping inland sea. She sank on the dry
pine-needles; he dropped beside her, and,
tearing off his cap, unquestioningly laid his
head in her lap.</p>

<p>"Does it ache?" she asked, softly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he murmured. "Rub it."</p>

<p>She passed her hand with a measured
motion across his forehead, pushing up the
heavy hair. She felt his face for an instant
press closer to her knees; volumes of gratitude
seemed expressed in the impulsive
movement. She continued her stroking
with a quiet, sisterly hand, her swelling heart
suddenly choking her. She had him back,
that she knew beyond a doubt. Broken,
disillusioned, his heart seared by the image
of another, he was hers, as he lay there
thinking of that other. Hers to help, to
heal, to make love her as much as she loved
him. And a flood of human passion, the
sensation she had decided&mdash;God forgive her!&mdash;disposed
of forever, surged in her. Her
eyes brimmed over with happy tears. Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
should there be any feeling of bitterness
mixed in a feeling so sweet? Why should
the hurt to one's vanity be remembered in
such a situation? Why not be finally glad
to give more than one received, offer something
whole for something broken, bless
beyond all desert? No&mdash;no&mdash;that other
could never have loved him so! Fate had
meant well by him in putting her out of
reach; this sorrow of his should pass away
and be as if it had never been. Chloris felt
in herself such inexhaustible wells of tenderness
and patience, she knew hers was the
good title; she knew she could be sufficient&mdash;make
Damon forget. Her heart sang a
song of praise and victory, while her hand
smoothed his forehead with the fancy that
it brushed away the image of Cytherea, fatal
line by line.</p>

<p>Ineffable fatigue drew her down from high
serene thoughts to thoughts nearer earth.
She ached; waves of unnatural sensation
swept through her, but she would not move.
The weight of his dear head was better than
ease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>While she took patience till he should be
ready to rise and go sensibly home to bed, a
whimsical image formed in her brain: Herself,
and to one side of her, a little higher,
Cytherea, and to the other, a little lower,
Chloe&mdash;and beyond Chloe, in the descending
line, some poor woman, not pretty or winning
at all, to whom Chloe must appear a half-divinity;
and above Cytherea, in the ascending
line, another fairer than she, for, when all
was said, there must be in this world women
even fairer than the great Cytherea, of whom
she, perchance, lying awake in her queenly
bed, would think with anguish, confessing
herself helpless to struggle. Poor Cytherea,
then, in her turn! Chloris framed a sincere
wish for her continued happiness, and that
in the event of despised love God should
grant her to become a philosopher. And
her imagination went on feebly, whimsically,
weaving. Still another fairer still creature
above Cytherea's victress&mdash;still another at
the other end, to whom the envier of Chloe
should be an object of envy&mdash;and so on, till
the chain seemed to extend from the seraphs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
down to the last of the most degraded race,
and take a slightly humorous aspect. "It
pleases the powers to be merry," thought
Chloris, and was conscious of no irreverence
in the conceit.</p>

<p>"Wake up, Chloris!" came Damon's voice,
sounding more as it had used to sound, before
he was so grown-up, and had untoward
things happen to him in his sentiments.</p>

<p>"I have not been asleep!" she said, sheepishly,
"except below my knees."</p>

<p>"I won't contradict you, but when I struck
a light you were nodding and smiling away
to yourself like a little China mandarin.
Have you any idea of the time it is? Well,
I won't enlighten you. What a crazy
thing we have been doing! Come, dear,
let me help you up. I hope to Heaven you
haven't taken cold. Hello, can't you walk
straight? What a brute I am! Take my
arm&mdash;"</p>

<p>And laughing weakly and wearily, they set
out staggering across the dim stubble-field
that separated them from home.</p>

<p>"Dear old Chloris!" Damon murmured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
pressing her arm to his side. "Best girl in
the universe! You can never think what a
comfort it is to have you home again. I feel
more like myself. I think that to-night I
shall sleep."</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
