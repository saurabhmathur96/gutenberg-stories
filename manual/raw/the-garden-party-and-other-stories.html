<h3>I</h3>

<p>
Very early morning. The sun was not yet risen, and the whole of Crescent Bay
was hidden under a white sea-mist. The big bush-covered hills at the back were
smothered. You could not see where they ended and the paddocks and bungalows
began. The sandy road was gone and the paddocks and bungalows the other side of
it; there were no white dunes covered with reddish grass beyond them; there was
nothing to mark which was beach and where was the sea. A heavy dew had fallen.
The grass was blue. Big drops hung on the bushes and just did not fall; the
silvery, fluffy toi-toi was limp on its long stalks, and all the marigolds and
the pinks in the bungalow gardens were bowed to the earth with wetness.
Drenched were the cold fuchsias, round pearls of dew lay on the flat nasturtium
leaves. It looked as though the sea had beaten up softly in the darkness, as
though one immense wave had come rippling, rippling&mdash;how far? Perhaps if
you had waked up in the middle of the night you might have seen a big fish
flicking in at the window and gone again....
</p>

<p>
Ah-Aah! sounded the sleepy sea. And from the bush there came the sound of
little streams flowing, quickly, lightly, slipping between the smooth stones,
gushing into ferny basins and out again; and there was the splashing of big
drops on large leaves, and something else&mdash;what was it?&mdash;a faint
stirring and shaking, the snapping of a twig and then such silence that it
seemed some one was listening.
</p>

<p>
Round the corner of Crescent Bay, between the piled-up masses of broken rock, a
flock of sheep came pattering. They were huddled together, a small, tossing,
woolly mass, and their thin, stick-like legs trotted along quickly as if the
cold and the quiet had frightened them. Behind them an old sheep-dog, his
soaking paws covered with sand, ran along with his nose to the ground, but
carelessly, as if thinking of something else. And then in the rocky gateway the
shepherd himself appeared. He was a lean, upright old man, in a frieze coat
that was covered with a web of tiny drops, velvet trousers tied under the knee,
and a wide-awake with a folded blue handkerchief round the brim. One hand was
crammed into his belt, the other grasped a beautifully smooth yellow stick. And
as he walked, taking his time, he kept up a very soft light whistling, an airy,
far-away fluting that sounded mournful and tender. The old dog cut an ancient
caper or two and then drew up sharp, ashamed of his levity, and walked a few
dignified paces by his master&rsquo;s side. The sheep ran forward in little
pattering rushes; they began to bleat, and ghostly flocks and herds answered
them from under the sea. &ldquo;Baa! Baaa!&rdquo; For a time they seemed to be
always on the same piece of ground. There ahead was stretched the sandy road
with shallow puddles; the same soaking bushes showed on either side and the
same shadowy palings. Then something immense came into view; an enormous
shock-haired giant with his arms stretched out. It was the big gum-tree outside
Mrs. Stubbs&rsquo; shop, and as they passed by there was a strong whiff of
eucalyptus. And now big spots of light gleamed in the mist. The shepherd
stopped whistling; he rubbed his red nose and wet beard on his wet sleeve and,
screwing up his eyes, glanced in the direction of the sea. The sun was rising.
It was marvellous how quickly the mist thinned, sped away, dissolved from the
shallow plain, rolled up from the bush and was gone as if in a hurry to escape;
big twists and curls jostled and shouldered each other as the silvery beams
broadened. The far-away sky&mdash;a bright, pure blue&mdash;was reflected in
the puddles, and the drops, swimming along the telegraph poles, flashed into
points of light. Now the leaping, glittering sea was so bright it made
one&rsquo;s eyes ache to look at it. The shepherd drew a pipe, the bowl as
small as an acorn, out of his breast pocket, fumbled for a chunk of speckled
tobacco, pared off a few shavings and stuffed the bowl. He was a grave,
fine-looking old man. As he lit up and the blue smoke wreathed his head, the
dog, watching, looked proud of him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Baa! Baaa!&rdquo; The sheep spread out into a fan. They were just clear
of the summer colony before the first sleeper turned over and lifted a drowsy
head; their cry sounded in the dreams of little children... who lifted their
arms to drag down, to cuddle the darling little woolly lambs of sleep. Then the
first inhabitant appeared; it was the Burnells&rsquo; cat Florrie, sitting on
the gatepost, far too early as usual, looking for their milk-girl. When she saw
the old sheep-dog she sprang up quickly, arched her back, drew in her tabby
head, and seemed to give a little fastidious shiver. &ldquo;Ugh! What a coarse,
revolting creature!&rdquo; said Florrie. But the old sheep-dog, not looking up,
waggled past, flinging out his legs from side to side. Only one of his ears
twitched to prove that he saw, and thought her a silly young female.
</p>

<p>
The breeze of morning lifted in the bush and the smell of leaves and wet black
earth mingled with the sharp smell of the sea. Myriads of birds were singing. A
goldfinch flew over the shepherd&rsquo;s head and, perching on the tiptop of a
spray, it turned to the sun, ruffling its small breast feathers. And now they
had passed the fisherman&rsquo;s hut, passed the charred-looking little
<i>whare</i> where Leila the milk-girl lived with her old Gran. The sheep
strayed over a yellow swamp and Wag, the sheep-dog, padded after, rounded them
up and headed them for the steeper, narrower rocky pass that led out of
Crescent Bay and towards Daylight Cove. &ldquo;Baa! Baa!&rdquo; Faint the cry
came as they rocked along the fast-drying road. The shepherd put away his pipe,
dropping it into his breast-pocket so that the little bowl hung over. And
straightway the soft airy whistling began again. Wag ran out along a ledge of
rock after something that smelled, and ran back again disgusted. Then pushing,
nudging, hurrying, the sheep rounded the bend and the shepherd followed after
out of sight.
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
A few moments later the back door of one of the bungalows opened, and a figure
in a broad-striped bathing suit flung down the paddock, cleared the stile,
rushed through the tussock grass into the hollow, staggered up the sandy
hillock, and raced for dear life over the big porous stones, over the cold, wet
pebbles, on to the hard sand that gleamed like oil. Splish-Splosh!
Splish-Splosh! The water bubbled round his legs as Stanley Burnell waded out
exulting. First man in as usual! He&rsquo;d beaten them all again. And he
swooped down to souse his head and neck.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hail, brother! All hail, Thou Mighty One!&rdquo; A velvety bass voice
came booming over the water.
</p>

<p>
Great Scott! Damnation take it! Stanley lifted up to see a dark head bobbing
far out and an arm lifted. It was Jonathan Trout&mdash;there before him!
&ldquo;Glorious morning!&rdquo; sang the voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, very fine!&rdquo; said Stanley briefly. Why the dickens
didn&rsquo;t the fellow stick to his part of the sea? Why should he come
barging over to this exact spot? Stanley gave a kick, a lunge and struck out,
swimming overarm. But Jonathan was a match for him. Up he came, his black hair
sleek on his forehead, his short beard sleek.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had an extraordinary dream last night!&rdquo; he shouted.
</p>

<p>
What was the matter with the man? This mania for conversation irritated Stanley
beyond words. And it was always the same&mdash;always some piffle about a dream
he&rsquo;d had, or some cranky idea he&rsquo;d got hold of, or some rot
he&rsquo;d been reading. Stanley turned over on his back and kicked with his
legs till he was a living waterspout. But even then.... &ldquo;I dreamed I was
hanging over a terrifically high cliff, shouting to some one below.&rdquo; You
would be! thought Stanley. He could stick no more of it. He stopped splashing.
&ldquo;Look here, Trout,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in rather a hurry
this morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re WHAT?&rdquo; Jonathan was so surprised&mdash;or pretended
to be&mdash;that he sank under the water, then reappeared again blowing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All I mean is,&rdquo; said Stanley, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no time
to&mdash;to&mdash;to fool about. I want to get this over. I&rsquo;m in a hurry.
I&rsquo;ve work to do this morning&mdash;see?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jonathan was gone before Stanley had finished. &ldquo;Pass, friend!&rdquo; said
the bass voice gently, and he slid away through the water with scarcely a
ripple.... But curse the fellow! He&rsquo;d ruined Stanley&rsquo;s bathe. What
an unpractical idiot the man was! Stanley struck out to sea again, and then as
quickly swam in again, and away he rushed up the beach. He felt cheated.
</p>

<p>
Jonathan stayed a little longer in the water. He floated, gently moving his
hands like fins, and letting the sea rock his long, skinny body. It was
curious, but in spite of everything he was fond of Stanley Burnell. True, he
had a fiendish desire to tease him sometimes, to poke fun at him, but at bottom
he was sorry for the fellow. There was something pathetic in his determination
to make a job of everything. You couldn&rsquo;t help feeling he&rsquo;d be
caught out one day, and then what an almighty cropper he&rsquo;d come! At that
moment an immense wave lifted Jonathan, rode past him, and broke along the
beach with a joyful sound. What a beauty! And now there came another. That was
the way to live&mdash;carelessly, recklessly, spending oneself. He got on to
his feet and began to wade towards the shore, pressing his toes into the firm,
wrinkled sand. To take things easy, not to fight against the ebb and flow of
life, but to give way to it&mdash;that was what was needed. It was this tension
that was all wrong. To live&mdash;to live! And the perfect morning, so fresh
and fair, basking in the light, as though laughing at its own beauty, seemed to
whisper, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But now he was out of the water Jonathan turned blue with cold. He ached all
over; it was as though some one was wringing the blood out of him. And stalking
up the beach, shivering, all his muscles tight, he too felt his bathe was
spoilt. He&rsquo;d stayed in too long.
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
Beryl was alone in the living-room when Stanley appeared, wearing a blue serge
suit, a stiff collar and a spotted tie. He looked almost uncannily clean and
brushed; he was going to town for the day. Dropping into his chair, he pulled
out his watch and put it beside his plate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got twenty-five minutes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
might go and see if the porridge is ready, Beryl?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s just gone for it,&rdquo; said Beryl. She sat down at the
table and poured out his tea.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; Stanley took a sip. &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; he said in an
astonished voice, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve forgotten the sugar.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, sorry!&rdquo; But even then Beryl didn&rsquo;t help him; she pushed
the basin across. What did this mean? As Stanley helped himself his blue eyes
widened; they seemed to quiver. He shot a quick glance at his sister-in-law and
leaned back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing wrong, is there?&rdquo; he asked carelessly, fingering his
collar.
</p>

<p>
Beryl&rsquo;s head was bent; she turned her plate in her fingers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said her light voice. Then she too looked up, and smiled
at Stanley. &ldquo;Why should there be?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O-oh! No reason at all as far as I know. I thought you seemed
rather&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At that moment the door opened and the three little girls appeared, each
carrying a porridge plate. They were dressed alike in blue jerseys and
knickers; their brown legs were bare, and each had her hair plaited and pinned
up in what was called a horse&rsquo;s tail. Behind them came Mrs. Fairfield
with the tray.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Carefully, children,&rdquo; she warned. But they were taking the very
greatest care. They loved being allowed to carry things. &ldquo;Have you said
good morning to your father?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, grandma.&rdquo; They settled themselves on the bench opposite
Stanley and Beryl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good morning, Stanley!&rdquo; Old Mrs. Fairfield gave him his plate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Morning, mother! How&rsquo;s the boy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Splendid! He only woke up once last night. What a perfect
morning!&rdquo; The old woman paused, her hand on the loaf of bread, to gaze
out of the open door into the garden. The sea sounded. Through the wide-open
window streamed the sun on to the yellow varnished walls and bare floor.
Everything on the table flashed and glittered. In the middle there was an old
salad bowl filled with yellow and red nasturtiums. She smiled, and a look of
deep content shone in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You might <i>cut</i> me a slice of that bread, mother,&rdquo; said
Stanley. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only twelve and a half minutes before the coach
passes. Has anyone given my shoes to the servant girl?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re ready for you.&rdquo; Mrs. Fairfield was quite
unruffled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Kezia! Why are you such a messy child!&rdquo; cried Beryl
despairingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Me, Aunt Beryl?&rdquo; Kezia stared at her. What had she done now? She
had only dug a river down the middle of her porridge, filled it, and was eating
the banks away. But she did that every single morning, and no one had said a
word up till now.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you eat your food properly like Isabel and
Lottie?&rdquo; How unfair grown-ups are!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But Lottie always makes a floating island, don&rsquo;t you,
Lottie?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Isabel smartly. &ldquo;I just sprinkle mine
with sugar and put on the milk and finish it. Only babies play with their
food.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stanley pushed back his chair and got up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you get me those shoes, mother? And, Beryl, if you&rsquo;ve
finished, I wish you&rsquo;d cut down to the gate and stop the coach. Run in to
your mother, Isabel, and ask her where my bowler hat&rsquo;s been put. Wait a
minute&mdash;have you children been playing with my stick?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, father!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I put it here.&rdquo; Stanley began to bluster. &ldquo;I remember
distinctly putting it in this corner. Now, who&rsquo;s had it? There&rsquo;s no
time to lose. Look sharp! The stick&rsquo;s got to be found.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Even Alice, the servant-girl, was drawn into the chase. &ldquo;You
haven&rsquo;t been using it to poke the kitchen fire with by any chance?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stanley dashed into the bedroom where Linda was lying. &ldquo;Most
extraordinary thing. I can&rsquo;t keep a single possession to myself.
They&rsquo;ve made away with my stick, now!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stick, dear? What stick?&rdquo; Linda&rsquo;s vagueness on these
occasions could not be real, Stanley decided. Would nobody sympathize with him?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Coach! Coach, Stanley!&rdquo; Beryl&rsquo;s voice cried from the gate.
</p>

<p>
Stanley waved his arm to Linda. &ldquo;No time to say good-bye!&rdquo; he
cried. And he meant that as a punishment to her.
</p>

<p>
He snatched his bowler hat, dashed out of the house, and swung down the garden
path. Yes, the coach was there waiting, and Beryl, leaning over the open gate,
was laughing up at somebody or other just as if nothing had happened. The
heartlessness of women! The way they took it for granted it was your job to
slave away for them while they didn&rsquo;t even take the trouble to see that
your walking-stick wasn&rsquo;t lost. Kelly trailed his whip across the horses.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-bye, Stanley,&rdquo; called Beryl, sweetly and gaily. It was easy
enough to say good-bye! And there she stood, idle, shading her eyes with her
hand. The worst of it was Stanley had to shout good-bye too, for the sake of
appearances. Then he saw her turn, give a little skip and run back to the
house. She was glad to be rid of him!
</p>

<p>
Yes, she was thankful. Into the living-room she ran and called
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; Linda cried from her room: &ldquo;Beryl! Has
Stanley gone?&rdquo; Old Mrs. Fairfield appeared, carrying the boy in his
little flannel coatee.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gone?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oh, the relief, the difference it made to have the man out of the house. Their
very voices were changed as they called to one another; they sounded warm and
loving and as if they shared a secret. Beryl went over to the table.
&ldquo;Have another cup of tea, mother. It&rsquo;s still hot.&rdquo; She
wanted, somehow, to celebrate the fact that they could do what they liked now.
There was no man to disturb them; the whole perfect day was theirs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, thank you, child,&rdquo; said old Mrs. Fairfield, but the way at
that moment she tossed the boy up and said &ldquo;a-goos-a-goos-a-ga!&rdquo; to
him meant that she felt the same. The little girls ran into the paddock like
chickens let out of a coop.
</p>

<p>
Even Alice, the servant-girl, washing up the dishes in the kitchen, caught the
infection and used the precious tank water in a perfectly reckless fashion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, these men!&rdquo; said she, and she plunged the teapot into the bowl
and held it under the water even after it had stopped bubbling, as if it too
was a man and drowning was too good for them.
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
&ldquo;Wait for me, Isa-bel! Kezia, wait for me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was poor little Lottie, left behind again, because she found it so
fearfully hard to get over the stile by herself. When she stood on the first
step her knees began to wobble; she grasped the post. Then you had to put one
leg over. But which leg? She never could decide. And when she did finally put
one leg over with a sort of stamp of despair&mdash;then the feeling was awful.
She was half in the paddock still and half in the tussock grass. She clutched
the post desperately and lifted up her voice. &ldquo;Wait for me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t you wait for her, Kezia!&rdquo; said Isabel.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s such a little silly. She&rsquo;s always making a fuss. Come
on!&rdquo; And she tugged Kezia&rsquo;s jersey. &ldquo;You can use my bucket if
you come with me,&rdquo; she said kindly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bigger than
yours.&rdquo; But Kezia couldn&rsquo;t leave Lottie all by herself. She ran
back to her. By this time Lottie was very red in the face and breathing
heavily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here, put your other foot over,&rdquo; said Kezia.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lottie looked down at Kezia as if from a mountain height.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here where my hand is.&rdquo; Kezia patted the place.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, <i>there</i> do you mean!&rdquo; Lottie gave a deep sigh and put the
second foot over.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now&mdash;sort of turn round and sit down and slide,&rdquo; said Kezia.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s nothing to sit down <i>on</i>, Kezia,&rdquo; said
Lottie.
</p>

<p>
She managed it at last, and once it was over she shook herself and began to
beam.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting better at climbing over stiles, aren&rsquo;t I,
Kezia?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lottie&rsquo;s was a very hopeful nature.
</p>

<p>
The pink and the blue sunbonnet followed Isabel&rsquo;s bright red sunbonnet up
that sliding, slipping hill. At the top they paused to decide where to go and
to have a good stare at who was there already. Seen from behind, standing
against the skyline, gesticulating largely with their spades, they looked like
minute puzzled explorers.
</p>

<p>
The whole family of Samuel Josephs was there already with their lady-help, who
sat on a camp-stool and kept order with a whistle that she wore tied round her
neck, and a small cane with which she directed operations. The Samuel Josephs
never played by themselves or managed their own game. If they did, it ended in
the boys pouring water down the girls&rsquo; necks or the girls trying to put
little black crabs into the boys&rsquo; pockets. So Mrs. S. J. and the poor
lady-help drew up what she called a &ldquo;brogramme&rdquo; every morning to
keep them &ldquo;abused and out of bischief.&rdquo; It was all competitions or
races or round games. Everything began with a piercing blast of the
lady-help&rsquo;s whistle and ended with another. There were even
prizes&mdash;large, rather dirty paper parcels which the lady-help with a sour
little smile drew out of a bulging string kit. The Samuel Josephs fought
fearfully for the prizes and cheated and pinched one another&rsquo;s
arms&mdash;they were all expert pinchers. The only time the Burnell children
ever played with them Kezia had got a prize, and when she undid three bits of
paper she found a very small rusty button-hook. She couldn&rsquo;t understand
why they made such a fuss....
</p>

<p>
But they never played with the Samuel Josephs now or even went to their
parties. The Samuel Josephs were always giving children&rsquo;s parties at the
Bay and there was always the same food. A big washhand basin of very brown
fruit-salad, buns cut into four and a washhand jug full of something the
lady-help called &ldquo;Limmonadear.&rdquo; And you went away in the evening
with half the frill torn off your frock or something spilled all down the front
of your open-work pinafore, leaving the Samuel Josephs leaping like savages on
their lawn. No! They were too awful.
</p>

<p>
On the other side of the beach, close down to the water, two little boys, their
knickers rolled up, twinkled like spiders. One was digging, the other pattered
in and out of the water, filling a small bucket. They were the Trout boys, Pip
and Rags. But Pip was so busy digging and Rags was so busy helping that they
didn&rsquo;t see their little cousins until they were quite close.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said Pip. &ldquo;Look what I&rsquo;ve discovered.&rdquo;
And he showed them an old wet, squashed-looking boot. The three little girls
stared.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whatever are you going to do with it?&rdquo; asked Kezia.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Keep it, of course!&rdquo; Pip was very scornful. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
find&mdash;see?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Yes, Kezia saw that. All the same....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of things buried in the sand,&rdquo; explained Pip.
&ldquo;They get chucked up from wrecks. Treasure. Why&mdash;you might
find&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why does Rags have to keep on pouring water in?&rdquo; asked Lottie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s to moisten it,&rdquo; said Pip, &ldquo;to make the work
a bit easier. Keep it up, Rags.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And good little Rags ran up and down, pouring in the water that turned brown
like cocoa.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here, shall I show you what I found yesterday?&rdquo; said Pip
mysteriously, and he stuck his spade into the sand. &ldquo;Promise not to
tell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They promised.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Say, cross my heart straight dinkum.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The little girls said it.
</p>

<p>
Pip took something out of his pocket, rubbed it a long time on the front of his
jersey, then breathed on it and rubbed it again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now turn round!&rdquo; he ordered.
</p>

<p>
They turned round.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All look the same way! Keep still! Now!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And his hand opened; he held up to the light something that flashed, that
winked, that was a most lovely green.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nemeral,&rdquo; said Pip solemnly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it really, Pip?&rdquo; Even Isabel was impressed.
</p>

<p>
The lovely green thing seemed to dance in Pip&rsquo;s fingers. Aunt Beryl had a
nemeral in a ring, but it was a very small one. This one was as big as a star
and far more beautiful.
</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>
As the morning lengthened whole parties appeared over the sand-hills and came
down on the beach to bathe. It was understood that at eleven o&rsquo;clock the
women and children of the summer colony had the sea to themselves. First the
women undressed, pulled on their bathing dresses and covered their heads in
hideous caps like sponge bags; then the children were unbuttoned. The beach was
strewn with little heaps of clothes and shoes; the big summer hats, with stones
on them to keep them from blowing away, looked like immense shells. It was
strange that even the sea seemed to sound differently when all those leaping,
laughing figures ran into the waves. Old Mrs. Fairfield, in a lilac cotton
dress and a black hat tied under the chin, gathered her little brood and got
them ready. The little Trout boys whipped their shirts over their heads, and
away the five sped, while their grandma sat with one hand in her knitting-bag
ready to draw out the ball of wool when she was satisfied they were safely in.
</p>

<p>
The firm compact little girls were not half so brave as the tender,
delicate-looking little boys. Pip and Rags, shivering, crouching down, slapping
the water, never hesitated. But Isabel, who could swim twelve strokes, and
Kezia, who could nearly swim eight, only followed on the strict understanding
they were not to be splashed. As for Lottie, she didn&rsquo;t follow at all.
She liked to be left to go in her own way, please. And that way was to sit down
at the edge of the water, her legs straight, her knees pressed together, and to
make vague motions with her arms as if she expected to be wafted out to sea.
But when a bigger wave than usual, an old whiskery one, came lolloping along in
her direction, she scrambled to her feet with a face of horror and flew up the
beach again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here, mother, keep those for me, will you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Two rings and a thin gold chain were dropped into Mrs Fairfield&rsquo;s lap.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, dear. But aren&rsquo;t you going to bathe here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; Beryl drawled. She sounded vague. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
undressing farther along. I&rsquo;m going to bathe with Mrs. Harry
Kember.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; But Mrs. Fairfield&rsquo;s lips set. She disapproved
of Mrs Harry Kember. Beryl knew it.
</p>

<p>
Poor old mother, she smiled, as she skimmed over the stones. Poor old mother!
Old! Oh, what joy, what bliss it was to be young....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You look very pleased,&rdquo; said Mrs. Harry Kember. She sat hunched up
on the stones, her arms round her knees, smoking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a lovely day,&rdquo; said Beryl, smiling down at her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh my <i>dear</i>!&rdquo; Mrs. Harry Kember&rsquo;s voice sounded as
though she knew better than that. But then her voice always sounded as though
she knew something better about you than you did yourself. She was a long,
strange-looking woman with narrow hands and feet. Her face, too, was long and
narrow and exhausted-looking; even her fair curled fringe looked burnt out and
withered. She was the only woman at the Bay who smoked, and she smoked
incessantly, keeping the cigarette between her lips while she talked, and only
taking it out when the ash was so long you could not understand why it did not
fall. When she was not playing bridge&mdash;she played bridge every day of her
life&mdash;she spent her time lying in the full glare of the sun. She could
stand any amount of it; she never had enough. All the same, it did not seem to
warm her. Parched, withered, cold, she lay stretched on the stones like a piece
of tossed-up driftwood. The women at the Bay thought she was very, very fast.
Her lack of vanity, her slang, the way she treated men as though she was one of
them, and the fact that she didn&rsquo;t care twopence about her house and
called the servant Gladys &ldquo;Glad-eyes,&rdquo; was disgraceful. Standing on
the veranda steps Mrs. Kember would call in her indifferent, tired voice,
&ldquo;I say, Glad-eyes, you might heave me a handkerchief if I&rsquo;ve got
one, will you?&rdquo; And Glad-eyes, a red bow in her hair instead of a cap,
and white shoes, came running with an impudent smile. It was an absolute
scandal! True, she had no children, and her husband.... Here the voices were
always raised; they became fervent. How can he have married her? How can he,
how can he? It must have been money, of course, but even then!
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Kember&rsquo;s husband was at least ten years younger than she was, and so
incredibly handsome that he looked like a mask or a most perfect illustration
in an American novel rather than a man. Black hair, dark blue eyes, red lips, a
slow sleepy smile, a fine tennis player, a perfect dancer, and with it all a
mystery. Harry Kember was like a man walking in his sleep. Men couldn&rsquo;t
stand him, they couldn&rsquo;t get a word out of the chap; he ignored his wife
just as she ignored him. How did he live? Of course there were stories, but
such stories! They simply couldn&rsquo;t be told. The women he&rsquo;d been
seen with, the places he&rsquo;d been seen in... but nothing was ever certain,
nothing definite. Some of the women at the Bay privately thought he&rsquo;d
commit a murder one day. Yes, even while they talked to Mrs. Kember and took in
the awful concoction she was wearing, they saw her, stretched as she lay on the
beach; but cold, bloody, and still with a cigarette stuck in the corner of her
mouth.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Kember rose, yawned, unsnapped her belt buckle, and tugged at the tape of
her blouse. And Beryl stepped out of her skirt and shed her jersey, and stood
up in her short white petticoat, and her camisole with ribbon bows on the
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mercy on us,&rdquo; said Mrs. Harry Kember, &ldquo;what a little beauty
you are!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Beryl softly; but, drawing off one stocking and
then the other, she felt a little beauty.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear&mdash;why not?&rdquo; said Mrs. Harry Kember, stamping on her
own petticoat. Really&mdash;her underclothes! A pair of blue cotton knickers
and a linen bodice that reminded one somehow of a pillow-case.... &ldquo;And
you don&rsquo;t wear stays, do you?&rdquo; She touched Beryl&rsquo;s waist, and
Beryl sprang away with a small affected cry. Then &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she said
firmly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lucky little creature,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Kember, unfastening her own.
</p>

<p>
Beryl turned her back and began the complicated movements of some one who is
trying to take off her clothes and to pull on her bathing-dress all at one and
the same time.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my dear&mdash;don&rsquo;t mind me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Harry Kember.
&ldquo;Why be shy? I shan&rsquo;t eat you. I shan&rsquo;t be shocked like those
other ninnies.&rdquo; And she gave her strange neighing laugh and grimaced at
the other women.
</p>

<p>
But Beryl was shy. She never undressed in front of anybody. Was that silly?
Mrs. Harry Kember made her feel it was silly, even something to be ashamed of.
Why be shy indeed! She glanced quickly at her friend standing so boldly in her
torn chemise and lighting a fresh cigarette; and a quick, bold, evil feeling
started up in her breast. Laughing recklessly, she drew on the limp,
sandy-feeling bathing-dress that was not quite dry and fastened the twisted
buttons.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; said Mrs. Harry Kember. They began to go
down the beach together. &ldquo;Really, it&rsquo;s a sin for you to wear
clothes, my dear. Somebody&rsquo;s got to tell you some day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The water was quite warm. It was that marvellous transparent blue, flecked with
silver, but the sand at the bottom looked gold; when you kicked with your toes
there rose a little puff of gold-dust. Now the waves just reached her breast.
Beryl stood, her arms outstretched, gazing out, and as each wave came she gave
the slightest little jump, so that it seemed it was the wave which lifted her
so gently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe in pretty girls having a good time,&rdquo; said Mrs. Harry
Kember. &ldquo;Why not? Don&rsquo;t you make a mistake, my dear. Enjoy
yourself.&rdquo; And suddenly she turned turtle, disappeared, and swam away
quickly, quickly, like a rat. Then she flicked round and began swimming back.
She was going to say something else. Beryl felt that she was being poisoned by
this cold woman, but she longed to hear. But oh, how strange, how horrible! As
Mrs. Harry Kember came up close she looked, in her black waterproof
bathing-cap, with her sleepy face lifted above the water, just her chin
touching, like a horrible caricature of her husband.
</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>
In a steamer chair, under a manuka tree that grew in the middle of the front
grass patch, Linda Burnell dreamed the morning away. She did nothing. She
looked up at the dark, close, dry leaves of the manuka, at the chinks of blue
between, and now and again a tiny yellowish flower dropped on her.
Pretty&mdash;yes, if you held one of those flowers on the palm of your hand and
looked at it closely, it was an exquisite small thing. Each pale yellow petal
shone as if each was the careful work of a loving hand. The tiny tongue in the
centre gave it the shape of a bell. And when you turned it over the outside was
a deep bronze colour. But as soon as they flowered, they fell and were
scattered. You brushed them off your frock as you talked; the horrid little
things got caught in one&rsquo;s hair. Why, then, flower at all? Who takes the
trouble&mdash;or the joy&mdash;to make all these things that are wasted,
wasted.... It was uncanny.
</p>

<p>
On the grass beside her, lying between two pillows, was the boy. Sound asleep
he lay, his head turned away from his mother. His fine dark hair looked more
like a shadow than like real hair, but his ear was a bright, deep coral. Linda
clasped her hands above her head and crossed her feet. It was very pleasant to
know that all these bungalows were empty, that everybody was down on the beach,
out of sight, out of hearing. She had the garden to herself; she was alone.
</p>

<p>
Dazzling white the picotees shone; the golden-eyed marigold glittered; the
nasturtiums wreathed the veranda poles in green and gold flame. If only one had
time to look at these flowers long enough, time to get over the sense of
novelty and strangeness, time to know them! But as soon as one paused to part
the petals, to discover the under-side of the leaf, along came Life and one was
swept away. And, lying in her cane chair, Linda felt so light; she felt like a
leaf. Along came Life like a wind and she was seized and shaken; she had to go.
Oh dear, would it always be so? Was there no escape?
</p>

<p>
... Now she sat on the veranda of their Tasmanian home, leaning against her
father&rsquo;s knee. And he promised, &ldquo;As soon as you and I are old
enough, Linny, we&rsquo;ll cut off somewhere, we&rsquo;ll escape. Two boys
together. I have a fancy I&rsquo;d like to sail up a river in China.&rdquo;
Linda saw that river, very wide, covered with little rafts and boats. She saw
the yellow hats of the boatmen and she heard their high, thin voices as they
called....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, papa.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But just then a very broad young man with bright ginger hair walked slowly past
their house, and slowly, solemnly even, uncovered. Linda&rsquo;s father pulled
her ear teasingly, in the way he had.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Linny&rsquo;s beau,&rdquo; he whispered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, papa, fancy being married to Stanley Burnell!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Well, she was married to him. And what was more she loved him. Not the Stanley
whom every one saw, not the everyday one; but a timid, sensitive, innocent
Stanley who knelt down every night to say his prayers, and who longed to be
good. Stanley was simple. If he believed in people&mdash;as he believed in her,
for instance&mdash;it was with his whole heart. He could not be disloyal; he
could not tell a lie. And how terribly he suffered if he thought
anyone&mdash;she&mdash;was not being dead straight, dead sincere with him!
&ldquo;This is too subtle for me!&rdquo; He flung out the words, but his open,
quivering, distraught look was like the look of a trapped beast.
</p>

<p>
But the trouble was&mdash;here Linda felt almost inclined to laugh, though
Heaven knows it was no laughing matter&mdash;she saw <i>her</i> Stanley so
seldom. There were glimpses, moments, breathing spaces of calm, but all the
rest of the time it was like living in a house that couldn&rsquo;t be cured of
the habit of catching on fire, on a ship that got wrecked every day. And it was
always Stanley who was in the thick of the danger. Her whole time was spent in
rescuing him, and restoring him, and calming him down, and listening to his
story. And what was left of her time was spent in the dread of having children.
</p>

<p>
Linda frowned; she sat up quickly in her steamer chair and clasped her ankles.
Yes, that was her real grudge against life; that was what she could not
understand. That was the question she asked and asked, and listened in vain for
the answer. It was all very well to say it was the common lot of women to bear
children. It wasn&rsquo;t true. She, for one, could prove that wrong. She was
broken, made weak, her courage was gone, through child-bearing. And what made
it doubly hard to bear was, she did not love her children. It was useless
pretending. Even if she had had the strength she never would have nursed and
played with the little girls. No, it was as though a cold breath had chilled
her through and through on each of those awful journeys; she had no warmth left
to give them. As to the boy&mdash;well, thank Heaven, mother had taken him; he
was mother&rsquo;s, or Beryl&rsquo;s, or anybody&rsquo;s who wanted him. She
had hardly held him in her arms. She was so indifferent about him that as he
lay there... Linda glanced down.
</p>

<p>
The boy had turned over. He lay facing her, and he was no longer asleep. His
dark-blue, baby eyes were open; he looked as though he was peeping at his
mother. And suddenly his face dimpled; it broke into a wide, toothless smile, a
perfect beam, no less.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; that happy smile seemed to say. &ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t you like me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was something so quaint, so unexpected about that smile that Linda smiled
herself. But she checked herself and said to the boy coldly, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t like babies.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t like babies?&rdquo; The boy couldn&rsquo;t believe her.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t like <i>me</i>?&rdquo; He waved his arms foolishly at his
mother.
</p>

<p>
Linda dropped off her chair on to the grass.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you keep on smiling?&rdquo; she said severely. &ldquo;If you knew
what I was thinking about, you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But he only squeezed up his eyes, slyly, and rolled his head on the pillow. He
didn&rsquo;t believe a word she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We know all about that!&rdquo; smiled the boy.
</p>

<p>
Linda was so astonished at the confidence of this little creature.... Ah no, be
sincere. That was not what she felt; it was something far different, it was
something so new, so.... The tears danced in her eyes; she breathed in a small
whisper to the boy, &ldquo;Hallo, my funny!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But by now the boy had forgotten his mother. He was serious again. Something
pink, something soft waved in front of him. He made a grab at it and it
immediately disappeared. But when he lay back, another, like the first,
appeared. This time he determined to catch it. He made a tremendous effort and
rolled right over.
</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>
The tide was out; the beach was deserted; lazily flopped the warm sea. The sun
beat down, beat down hot and fiery on the fine sand, baking the grey and blue
and black and white-veined pebbles. It sucked up the little drop of water that
lay in the hollow of the curved shells; it bleached the pink convolvulus that
threaded through and through the sand-hills. Nothing seemed to move but the
small sand-hoppers. Pit-pit-pit! They were never still.
</p>

<p>
Over there on the weed-hung rocks that looked at low tide like shaggy beasts
come down to the water to drink, the sunlight seemed to spin like a silver coin
dropped into each of the small rock pools. They danced, they quivered, and
minute ripples laved the porous shores. Looking down, bending over, each pool
was like a lake with pink and blue houses clustered on the shores; and oh! the
vast mountainous country behind those houses&mdash;the ravines, the passes, the
dangerous creeks and fearful tracks that led to the water&rsquo;s edge.
Underneath waved the sea-forest&mdash;pink thread-like trees, velvet anemones,
and orange berry-spotted weeds. Now a stone on the bottom moved, rocked, and
there was a glimpse of a black feeler; now a thread-like creature wavered by
and was lost. Something was happening to the pink, waving trees; they were
changing to a cold moonlight blue. And now there sounded the faintest
&ldquo;plop.&rdquo; Who made that sound? What was going on down there? And how
strong, how damp the seaweed smelt in the hot sun....
</p>

<p>
The green blinds were drawn in the bungalows of the summer colony. Over the
verandas, prone on the paddock, flung over the fences, there were
exhausted-looking bathing-dresses and rough striped towels. Each back window
seemed to have a pair of sand-shoes on the sill and some lumps of rock or a
bucket or a collection of pawa shells. The bush quivered in a haze of heat; the
sandy road was empty except for the Trouts&rsquo; dog Snooker, who lay
stretched in the very middle of it. His blue eye was turned up, his legs stuck
out stiffly, and he gave an occasional desperate-sounding puff, as much as to
say he had decided to make an end of it and was only waiting for some kind cart
to come along.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you looking at, my grandma? Why do you keep stopping and sort
of staring at the wall?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kezia and her grandmother were taking their siesta together. The little girl,
wearing only her short drawers and her under-bodice, her arms and legs bare,
lay on one of the puffed-up pillows of her grandma&rsquo;s bed, and the old
woman, in a white ruffled dressing-gown, sat in a rocker at the window, with a
long piece of pink knitting in her lap. This room that they shared, like the
other rooms of the bungalow, was of light varnished wood and the floor was
bare. The furniture was of the shabbiest, the simplest. The dressing-table, for
instance, was a packing-case in a sprigged muslin petticoat, and the mirror
above was very strange; it was as though a little piece of forked lightning was
imprisoned in it. On the table there stood a jar of sea-pinks, pressed so
tightly together they looked more like a velvet pincushion, and a special shell
which Kezia had given her grandma for a pin-tray, and another even more special
which she had thought would make a very nice place for a watch to curl up in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me, grandma,&rdquo; said Kezia.
</p>

<p>
The old woman sighed, whipped the wool twice round her thumb, and drew the bone
needle through. She was casting on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was thinking of your Uncle William, darling,&rdquo; she said quietly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My Australian Uncle William?&rdquo; said Kezia. She had another.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The one I never saw?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was the one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what happened to him?&rdquo; Kezia knew perfectly well, but she
wanted to be told again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He went to the mines, and he got a sunstroke there and died,&rdquo; said
old Mrs. Fairfield.
</p>

<p>
Kezia blinked and considered the picture again.... A little man fallen over
like a tin soldier by the side of a big black hole.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does it make you sad to think about him, grandma?&rdquo; She hated her
grandma to be sad.
</p>

<p>
It was the old woman&rsquo;s turn to consider. Did it make her sad? To look
back, back. To stare down the years, as Kezia had seen her doing. To look after
<i>them</i> as a woman does, long after <i>they</i> were out of sight. Did it
make her sad? No, life was like that.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Kezia.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; asked Kezia. She lifted one bare arm and began to draw
things in the air. &ldquo;Why did Uncle William have to die? He wasn&rsquo;t
old.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Fairfield began counting the stitches in threes. &ldquo;It just
happened,&rdquo; she said in an absorbed voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does everybody have to die?&rdquo; asked Kezia.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Everybody!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Me?</i>&rdquo; Kezia sounded fearfully incredulous.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Some day, my darling.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, grandma.&rdquo; Kezia waved her left leg and waggled the toes. They
felt sandy. &ldquo;What if I just won&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old woman sighed again and drew a long thread from the ball.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not asked, Kezia,&rdquo; she said sadly. &ldquo;It happens
to all of us sooner or later.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Kezia lay still thinking this over. She didn&rsquo;t want to die. It meant she
would have to leave here, leave everywhere, for ever, leave&mdash;leave her
grandma. She rolled over quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Grandma,&rdquo; she said in a startled voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What, my pet!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re</i> not to die.&rdquo; Kezia was very decided.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Kezia&rdquo;&mdash;her grandma looked up and smiled and shook her
head&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not to. You couldn&rsquo;t leave me. You couldn&rsquo;t
not be there.&rdquo; This was awful. &ldquo;Promise me you won&rsquo;t ever do
it, grandma,&rdquo; pleaded Kezia.
</p>

<p>
The old woman went on knitting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Promise me! Say never!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But still her grandma was silent.
</p>

<p>
Kezia rolled off her bed; she couldn&rsquo;t bear it any longer, and lightly
she leapt on to her grandma&rsquo;s knees, clasped her hands round the old
woman&rsquo;s throat and began kissing her, under the chin, behind the ear, and
blowing down her neck.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Say never... say never... say never&mdash;&rdquo; She gasped between the
kisses. And then she began, very softly and lightly, to tickle her grandma.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Kezia!&rdquo; The old woman dropped her knitting. She swung back in the
rocker. She began to tickle Kezia. &ldquo;Say never, say never, say
never,&rdquo; gurgled Kezia, while they lay there laughing in each
other&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;Come, that&rsquo;s enough, my squirrel! That&rsquo;s
enough, my wild pony!&rdquo; said old Mrs. Fairfield, setting her cap straight.
&ldquo;Pick up my knitting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Both of them had forgotten what the &ldquo;never&rdquo; was about.
</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>
The sun was still full on the garden when the back door of the Burnells&rsquo;
shut with a bang, and a very gay figure walked down the path to the gate. It
was Alice, the servant-girl, dressed for her afternoon out. She wore a white
cotton dress with such large red spots on it and so many that they made you
shudder, white shoes and a leghorn turned up under the brim with poppies. Of
course she wore gloves, white ones, stained at the fastenings with iron-mould,
and in one hand she carried a very dashed-looking sunshade which she referred
to as her &ldquo;<i>perishall</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Beryl, sitting in the window, fanning her freshly-washed hair, thought she had
never seen such a guy. If Alice had only blacked her face with a piece of cork
before she started out, the picture would have been complete. And where did a
girl like that go to in a place like this? The heart-shaped Fijian fan beat
scornfully at that lovely bright mane. She supposed Alice had picked up some
horrible common larrikin and they&rsquo;d go off into the bush together. Pity
to have made herself so conspicuous; they&rsquo;d have hard work to hide with
Alice in that rig-out.
</p>

<p>
But no, Beryl was unfair. Alice was going to tea with Mrs Stubbs, who&rsquo;d
sent her an &ldquo;invite&rdquo; by the little boy who called for orders. She
had taken ever such a liking to Mrs. Stubbs ever since the first time she went
to the shop to get something for her mosquitoes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear heart!&rdquo; Mrs. Stubbs had clapped her hand to her side.
&ldquo;I never seen anyone so eaten. You might have been attacked by
canningbals.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Alice did wish there&rsquo;d been a bit of life on the road though. Made her
feel so queer, having nobody behind her. Made her feel all weak in the spine.
She couldn&rsquo;t believe that some one wasn&rsquo;t watching her. And yet it
was silly to turn round; it gave you away. She pulled up her gloves, hummed to
herself and said to the distant gum-tree, &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t be long
now.&rdquo; But that was hardly company.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Stubbs&rsquo;s shop was perched on a little hillock just off the road. It
had two big windows for eyes, a broad veranda for a hat, and the sign on the
roof, scrawled MRS. STUBBS&rsquo;S, was like a little card stuck rakishly in
the hat crown.
</p>

<p>
On the veranda there hung a long string of bathing-dresses, clinging together
as though they&rsquo;d just been rescued from the sea rather than waiting to go
in, and beside them there hung a cluster of sandshoes so extraordinarily mixed
that to get at one pair you had to tear apart and forcibly separate at least
fifty. Even then it was the rarest thing to find the left that belonged to the
right. So many people had lost patience and gone off with one shoe that fitted
and one that was a little too big.... Mrs. Stubbs prided herself on keeping
something of everything. The two windows, arranged in the form of precarious
pyramids, were crammed so tight, piled so high, that it seemed only a conjurer
could prevent them from toppling over. In the left-hand corner of one window,
glued to the pane by four gelatine lozenges, there was&mdash;and there had been
from time immemorial&mdash;a notice.
</p>

<p class="center">
LOST! HANSOME GOLE BROOCH<br />
SOLID GOLD<br />
ON OR NEAR BEACH<br />
REWARD OFFERED
</p>

<p>
Alice pressed open the door. The bell jangled, the red serge curtains parted,
and Mrs. Stubbs appeared. With her broad smile and the long bacon knife in her
hand, she looked like a friendly brigand. Alice was welcomed so warmly that she
found it quite difficult to keep up her &ldquo;manners.&rdquo; They consisted
of persistent little coughs and hems, pulls at her gloves, tweaks at her skirt,
and a curious difficulty in seeing what was set before her or understanding
what was said.
</p>

<p>
Tea was laid on the parlour table&mdash;ham, sardines, a whole pound of butter,
and such a large johnny cake that it looked like an advertisement for
somebody&rsquo;s baking-powder. But the Primus stove roared so loudly that it
was useless to try to talk above it. Alice sat down on the edge of a
basket-chair while Mrs. Stubbs pumped the stove still higher. Suddenly Mrs.
Stubbs whipped the cushion off a chair and disclosed a large brown-paper
parcel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just had some new photers taken, my dear,&rdquo; she shouted
cheerfully to Alice. &ldquo;Tell me what you think of them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In a very dainty, refined way Alice wet her finger and put the tissue back from
the first one. Life! How many there were! There were three dozzing at least.
And she held it up to the light.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Stubbs sat in an arm-chair, leaning very much to one side. There was a
look of mild astonishment on her large face, and well there might be. For
though the arm-chair stood on a carpet, to the left of it, miraculously
skirting the carpet-border, there was a dashing water-fall. On her right stood
a Grecian pillar with a giant fern-tree on either side of it, and in the
background towered a gaunt mountain, pale with snow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is a nice style, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; shouted Mrs. Stubbs; and
Alice had just screamed &ldquo;Sweetly&rdquo; when the roaring of the Primus
stove died down, fizzled out, ceased, and she said &ldquo;Pretty&rdquo; in a
silence that was frightening.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Draw up your chair, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Stubbs, beginning to pour
out. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully, as she handed the tea,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t care about the size. I&rsquo;m having an enlargemint.
All very well for Christmas cards, but I never was the one for small photers
myself. You get no comfort out of them. To say the truth, I find them
dis&rsquo;eartening.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Alice quite saw what she meant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Size,&rdquo; said Mrs. Stubbs. &ldquo;Give me size. That was what my
poor dear husband was always saying. He couldn&rsquo;t stand anything small.
Gave him the creeps. And, strange as it may seem, my dear&rdquo;&mdash;here
Mrs. Stubbs creaked and seemed to expand herself at the memory&mdash;&ldquo;it
was dropsy that carried him off at the larst. Many&rsquo;s the time they drawn
one and a half pints from &rsquo;im at the &rsquo;ospital... It seemed like a
judgmint.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Alice burned to know exactly what it was that was drawn from him. She ventured,
&ldquo;I suppose it was water.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Mrs. Stubbs fixed Alice with her eyes and replied meaningly, &ldquo;It was
<i>liquid</i>, my dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Liquid! Alice jumped away from the word like a cat and came back to it, nosing
and wary.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s &rsquo;im!&rdquo; said Mrs. Stubbs, and she pointed
dramatically to the life-size head and shoulders of a burly man with a dead
white rose in the buttonhole of his coat that made you think of a curl of cold
mutting fat. Just below, in silver letters on a red cardboard ground, were the
words, &ldquo;Be not afraid, it is I.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ever such a fine face,&rdquo; said Alice faintly.
</p>

<p>
The pale-blue bow on the top of Mrs. Stubbs&rsquo;s fair frizzy hair quivered.
She arched her plump neck. What a neck she had! It was bright pink where it
began and then it changed to warm apricot, and that faded to the colour of a
brown egg and then to a deep creamy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All the same, my dear,&rdquo; she said surprisingly,
&ldquo;freedom&rsquo;s best!&rdquo; Her soft, fat chuckle sounded like a purr.
&ldquo;Freedom&rsquo;s best,&rdquo; said Mrs. Stubbs again.
</p>

<p>
Freedom! Alice gave a loud, silly little titter. She felt awkward. Her mind
flew back to her own kitching. Ever so queer! She wanted to be back in it
again.
</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>
A strange company assembled in the Burnells&rsquo; washhouse after tea. Round
the table there sat a bull, a rooster, a donkey that kept forgetting it was a
donkey, a sheep and a bee. The washhouse was the perfect place for such a
meeting because they could make as much noise as they liked, and nobody ever
interrupted. It was a small tin shed standing apart from the bungalow. Against
the wall there was a deep trough and in the corner a copper with a basket of
clothes-pegs on top of it. The little window, spun over with cobwebs, had a
piece of candle and a mouse-trap on the dusty sill. There were clotheslines
criss-crossed overhead and, hanging from a peg on the wall, a very big, a huge,
rusty horseshoe. The table was in the middle with a form at either side.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be a bee, Kezia. A bee&rsquo;s not an animal. It&rsquo;s
a ninseck.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, but I do want to be a bee frightfully,&rdquo; wailed Kezia.... A
tiny bee, all yellow-furry, with striped legs. She drew her legs up under her
and leaned over the table. She felt she was a bee.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A ninseck must be an animal,&rdquo; she said stoutly. &ldquo;It makes a
noise. It&rsquo;s not like a fish.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bull, I&rsquo;m a bull!&rdquo; cried Pip. And he gave such a
tremendous bellow&mdash;how did he make that noise?&mdash;that Lottie looked
quite alarmed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be a sheep,&rdquo; said little Rags. &ldquo;A whole lot of
sheep went past this morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dad heard them. Baa!&rdquo; He sounded like the little lamb that trots
behind and seems to wait to be carried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cock-a-doodle-do!&rdquo; shrilled Isabel. With her red cheeks and bright
eyes she looked like a rooster.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll I be?&rdquo; Lottie asked everybody, and she sat there
smiling, waiting for them to decide for her. It had to be an easy one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be a donkey, Lottie.&rdquo; It was Kezia&rsquo;s suggestion.
&ldquo;Hee-haw! You can&rsquo;t forget that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hee-haw!&rdquo; said Lottie solemnly. &ldquo;When do I have to say
it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain, I&rsquo;ll explain,&rdquo; said the bull. It was he
who had the cards. He waved them round his head. &ldquo;All be quiet! All
listen!&rdquo; And he waited for them. &ldquo;Look here, Lottie.&rdquo; He
turned up a card. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got two spots on it&mdash;see? Now, if you
put that card in the middle and somebody else has one with two spots as well,
you say &lsquo;Hee-haw,&rsquo; and the card&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mine?&rdquo; Lottie was round-eyed. &ldquo;To keep?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, silly. Just for the game, see? Just while we&rsquo;re
playing.&rdquo; The bull was very cross with her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Lottie, you <i>are</i> a little silly,&rdquo; said the proud
rooster.
</p>

<p>
Lottie looked at both of them. Then she hung her head; her lip quivered.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to play,&rdquo; she whispered. The others glanced at
one another like conspirators. All of them knew what that meant. She would go
away and be discovered somewhere standing with her pinny thrown over her head,
in a corner, or against a wall, or even behind a chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you <i>do</i>, Lottie. It&rsquo;s quite easy,&rdquo; said Kezia.
</p>

<p>
And Isabel, repentant, said exactly like a grown-up, &ldquo;Watch <i>me</i>,
Lottie, and you&rsquo;ll soon learn.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cheer up, Lot,&rdquo; said Pip. &ldquo;There, I know what I&rsquo;ll do.
I&rsquo;ll give you the first one. It&rsquo;s mine, really, but I&rsquo;ll give
it to you. Here you are.&rdquo; And he slammed the card down in front of
Lottie.
</p>

<p>
Lottie revived at that. But now she was in another difficulty. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t got a hanky,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I want one badly,
too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here, Lottie, you can use mine.&rdquo; Rags dipped into his sailor
blouse and brought up a very wet-looking one, knotted together. &ldquo;Be very
careful,&rdquo; he warned her. &ldquo;Only use that corner. Don&rsquo;t undo
it. I&rsquo;ve got a little starfish inside I&rsquo;m going to try and
tame.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, come on, you girls,&rdquo; said the bull. &ldquo;And
mind&mdash;you&rsquo;re not to look at your cards. You&rsquo;ve got to keep
your hands under the table till I say &lsquo;Go.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Smack went the cards round the table. They tried with all their might to see,
but Pip was too quick for them. It was very exciting, sitting there in the
washhouse; it was all they could do not to burst into a little chorus of
animals before Pip had finished dealing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, Lottie, you begin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Timidly Lottie stretched out a hand, took the top card off her pack, had a good
look at it&mdash;it was plain she was counting the spots&mdash;and put it down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Lottie, you can&rsquo;t do that. You mustn&rsquo;t look first. You
must turn it the other way over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But then everybody will see it the same time as me,&rdquo; said Lottie.
</p>

<p>
The game proceeded. Mooe-ooo-er! The bull was terrible. He charged over the
table and seemed to eat the cards up.
</p>

<p>
Bss-ss! said the bee.
</p>

<p>
Cock-a-doodle-do! Isabel stood up in her excitement and moved her elbows like
wings.
</p>

<p>
Baa! Little Rags put down the King of Diamonds and Lottie put down the one they
called the King of Spain. She had hardly any cards left.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you call out, Lottie?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgotten what I am,&rdquo; said the donkey woefully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, change! Be a dog instead! Bow-wow!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes. That&rsquo;s <i>much</i> easier.&rdquo; Lottie smiled again. But
when she and Kezia both had a one Kezia waited on purpose. The others made
signs to Lottie and pointed. Lottie turned very red; she looked bewildered, and
at last she said, &ldquo;Hee-haw! Ke-zia.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ss! Wait a minute!&rdquo; They were in the very thick of it when the
bull stopped them, holding up his hand. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? What&rsquo;s
that noise?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What noise? What do you mean?&rdquo; asked the rooster.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ss! Shut up! Listen!&rdquo; They were mouse-still. &ldquo;I thought I
heard a&mdash;a sort of knocking,&rdquo; said the bull.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What was it like?&rdquo; asked the sheep faintly.
</p>

<p>
No answer.
</p>

<p>
The bee gave a shudder. &ldquo;Whatever did we shut the door for?&rdquo; she
said softly. Oh, why, why had they shut the door?
</p>

<p>
While they were playing, the day had faded; the gorgeous sunset had blazed and
died. And now the quick dark came racing over the sea, over the sand-hills, up
the paddock. You were frightened to look in the corners of the washhouse, and
yet you had to look with all your might. And somewhere, far away, grandma was
lighting a lamp. The blinds were being pulled down; the kitchen fire leapt in
the tins on the mantelpiece.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would be awful now,&rdquo; said the bull, &ldquo;if a spider was to
fall from the ceiling on to the table, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Spiders don&rsquo;t fall from ceilings.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, they do. Our Min told us she&rsquo;d seen a spider as big as a
saucer, with long hairs on it like a gooseberry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Quickly all the little heads were jerked up; all the little bodies drew
together, pressed together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t somebody come and call us?&rdquo; cried the rooster.
</p>

<p>
Oh, those grown-ups, laughing and snug, sitting in the lamp-light, drinking out
of cups! They&rsquo;d forgotten about them. No, not really forgotten. That was
what their smile meant. They had decided to leave them there all by themselves.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Lottie gave such a piercing scream that all of them jumped off the
forms, all of them screamed too. &ldquo;A face&mdash;a face looking!&rdquo;
shrieked Lottie.
</p>

<p>
It was true, it was real. Pressed against the window was a pale face, black
eyes, a black beard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Grandma! Mother! Somebody!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But they had not got to the door, tumbling over one another, before it opened
for Uncle Jonathan. He had come to take the little boys home.
</p>

<h3>X</h3>

<p>
He had meant to be there before, but in the front garden he had come upon Linda
walking up and down the grass, stopping to pick off a dead pink or give a
top-heavy carnation something to lean against, or to take a deep breath of
something, and then walking on again, with her little air of remoteness. Over
her white frock she wore a yellow, pink-fringed shawl from the Chinaman&rsquo;s
shop.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hallo, Jonathan!&rdquo; called Linda. And Jonathan whipped off his
shabby panama, pressed it against his breast, dropped on one knee, and kissed
Linda&rsquo;s hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Greeting, my Fair One! Greeting, my Celestial Peach Blossom!&rdquo;
boomed the bass voice gently. &ldquo;Where are the other noble dames?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Beryl&rsquo;s out playing bridge and mother&rsquo;s giving the boy his
bath.... Have you come to borrow something?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Trouts were for ever running out of things and sending across to the
Burnells&rsquo; at the last moment.
</p>

<p>
But Jonathan only answered, &ldquo;A little love, a little kindness;&rdquo; and
he walked by his sister-in-law&rsquo;s side.
</p>

<p>
Linda dropped into Beryl&rsquo;s hammock under the manuka-tree, and Jonathan
stretched himself on the grass beside her, pulled a long stalk and began
chewing it. They knew each other well. The voices of children cried from the
other gardens. A fisherman&rsquo;s light cart shook along the sandy road, and
from far away they heard a dog barking; it was muffled as though the dog had
its head in a sack. If you listened you could just hear the soft swish of the
sea at full tide sweeping the pebbles. The sun was sinking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And so you go back to the office on Monday, do you, Jonathan?&rdquo;
asked Linda.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On Monday the cage door opens and clangs to upon the victim for another
eleven months and a week,&rdquo; answered Jonathan.
</p>

<p>
Linda swung a little. &ldquo;It must be awful,&rdquo; she said slowly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would ye have me laugh, my fair sister? Would ye have me weep?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Linda was so accustomed to Jonathan&rsquo;s way of talking that she paid no
attention to it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she said vaguely, &ldquo;one gets used to it. One gets
used to anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does one? Hum!&rdquo; The &ldquo;Hum&rdquo; was so deep it seemed to
boom from underneath the ground. &ldquo;I wonder how it&rsquo;s done,&rdquo;
brooded Jonathan; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never managed it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Looking at him as he lay there, Linda thought again how attractive he was. It
was strange to think that he was only an ordinary clerk, that Stanley earned
twice as much money as he. What was the matter with Jonathan? He had no
ambition; she supposed that was it. And yet one felt he was gifted,
exceptional. He was passionately fond of music; every spare penny he had went
on books. He was always full of new ideas, schemes, plans. But nothing came of
it all. The new fire blazed in Jonathan; you almost heard it roaring softly as
he explained, described and dilated on the new thing; but a moment later it had
fallen in and there was nothing but ashes, and Jonathan went about with a look
like hunger in his black eyes. At these times he exaggerated his absurd manner
of speaking, and he sang in church&mdash;he was the leader of the
choir&mdash;with such fearful dramatic intensity that the meanest hymn put on
an unholy splendour.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It seems to me just as imbecile, just as infernal, to have to go to the
office on Monday,&rdquo; said Jonathan, &ldquo;as it always has done and always
will do. To spend all the best years of one&rsquo;s life sitting on a stool
from nine to five, scratching in somebody&rsquo;s ledger! It&rsquo;s a queer
use to make of one&rsquo;s... one and only life, isn&rsquo;t it? Or do I fondly
dream?&rdquo; He rolled over on the grass and looked up at Linda. &ldquo;Tell
me, what is the difference between my life and that of an ordinary prisoner.
The only difference I can see is that I put myself in jail and nobody&rsquo;s
ever going to let me out. That&rsquo;s a more intolerable situation than the
other. For if I&rsquo;d been&mdash;pushed in, against my will&mdash;kicking,
even&mdash;once the door was locked, or at any rate in five years or so, I
might have accepted the fact and begun to take an interest in the flight of
flies or counting the warder&rsquo;s steps along the passage with particular
attention to variations of tread and so on. But as it is, I&rsquo;m like an
insect that&rsquo;s flown into a room of its own accord. I dash against the
walls, dash against the windows, flop against the ceiling, do everything on
God&rsquo;s earth, in fact, except fly out again. And all the while I&rsquo;m
thinking, like that moth, or that butterfly, or whatever it is, &lsquo;The
shortness of life! The shortness of life!&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve only one night or
one day, and there&rsquo;s this vast dangerous garden, waiting out there,
undiscovered, unexplored.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, if you feel like that, why&mdash;&rdquo; began Linda quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Ah!</i>&rdquo; cried Jonathan. And that &ldquo;ah!&rdquo; was somehow
almost exultant. &ldquo;There you have me. Why? Why indeed? There&rsquo;s the
maddening, mysterious question. Why don&rsquo;t I fly out again? There&rsquo;s
the window or the door or whatever it was I came in by. It&rsquo;s not
hopelessly shut&mdash;is it? Why don&rsquo;t I find it and be off? Answer me
that, little sister.&rdquo; But he gave her no time to answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m exactly like that insect again. For some
reason&rdquo;&mdash;Jonathan paused between the words&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s
not allowed, it&rsquo;s forbidden, it&rsquo;s against the insect law, to stop
banging and flopping and crawling up the pane even for an instant. Why
don&rsquo;t I leave the office? Why don&rsquo;t I seriously consider, this
moment, for instance, what it is that prevents me leaving? It&rsquo;s not as
though I&rsquo;m tremendously tied. I&rsquo;ve two boys to provide for, but,
after all, they&rsquo;re boys. I could cut off to sea, or get a job up-country,
or&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly he smiled at Linda and said in a changed voice, as if
he were confiding a secret, &ldquo;Weak... weak. No stamina. No anchor. No
guiding principle, let us call it.&rdquo; But then the dark velvety voice
rolled out:
</p>

<p class="poem">
Would ye hear the story<br />
How it unfolds itself. . .

and they were silent.

<p>
The sun had set. In the western sky there were great masses of crushed-up
rose-coloured clouds. Broad beams of light shone through the clouds and beyond
them as if they would cover the whole sky. Overhead the blue faded; it turned a
pale gold, and the bush outlined against it gleamed dark and brilliant like
metal. Sometimes when those beams of light show in the sky they are very awful.
They remind you that up there sits Jehovah, the jealous God, the Almighty,
Whose eye is upon you, ever watchful, never weary. You remember that at His
coming the whole earth will shake into one ruined graveyard; the cold, bright
angels will drive you this way and that, and there will be no time to explain
what could be explained so simply.... But to-night it seemed to Linda there was
something infinitely joyful and loving in those silver beams. And now no sound
came from the sea. It breathed softly as if it would draw that tender, joyful
beauty into its own bosom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all wrong, it&rsquo;s all wrong,&rdquo; came the shadowy
voice of Jonathan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the scene, it&rsquo;s not the setting
for... three stools, three desks, three inkpots and a wire blind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Linda knew that he would never change, but she said, &ldquo;Is it too late,
even now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m old&mdash;I&rsquo;m old,&rdquo; intoned Jonathan. He bent
towards her, he passed his hand over his head. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; His black
hair was speckled all over with silver, like the breast plumage of a black
fowl.
</p>

<p>
Linda was surprised. She had no idea that he was grey. And yet, as he stood up
beside her and sighed and stretched, she saw him, for the first time, not
resolute, not gallant, not careless, but touched already with age. He looked
very tall on the darkening grass, and the thought crossed her mind, &ldquo;He
is like a weed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jonathan stooped again and kissed her fingers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Heaven reward thy sweet patience, lady mine,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;I must go seek those heirs to my fame and fortune....&rdquo; He was
gone.
</p>

<h3>XI</h3>

<p>
Light shone in the windows of the bungalow. Two square patches of gold fell
upon the pinks and the peaked marigolds. Florrie, the cat, came out on to the
veranda, and sat on the top step, her white paws close together, her tail
curled round. She looked content, as though she had been waiting for this
moment all day.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank goodness, it&rsquo;s getting late,&rdquo; said Florrie.
&ldquo;Thank goodness, the long day is over.&rdquo; Her greengage eyes opened.
</p>

<p>
Presently there sounded the rumble of the coach, the crack of Kelly&rsquo;s
whip. It came near enough for one to hear the voices of the men from town,
talking loudly together. It stopped at the Burnells&rsquo; gate.
</p>

<p>
Stanley was half-way up the path before he saw Linda. &ldquo;Is that you,
darling?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Stanley.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He leapt across the flower-bed and seized her in his arms. She was enfolded in
that familiar, eager, strong embrace.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Forgive me, darling, forgive me,&rdquo; stammered Stanley, and he put
his hand under her chin and lifted her face to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Forgive you?&rdquo; smiled Linda. &ldquo;But whatever for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good God! You can&rsquo;t have forgotten,&rdquo; cried Stanley Burnell.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of nothing else all day. I&rsquo;ve had the hell of a
day. I made up my mind to dash out and telegraph, and then I thought the wire
mightn&rsquo;t reach you before I did. I&rsquo;ve been in tortures,
Linda.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, Stanley,&rdquo; said Linda, &ldquo;what must I forgive you
for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Linda!&rdquo;&mdash;Stanley was very hurt&mdash;&ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you
realize&mdash;you must have realized&mdash;I went away without saying good-bye
to you this morning? I can&rsquo;t imagine how I can have done such a thing. My
confounded temper, of course. But&mdash;well&rdquo;&mdash;and he sighed and
took her in his arms again&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve suffered for it enough
to-day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;ve got in your hand?&rdquo; asked Linda.
&ldquo;New gloves? Let me see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, just a cheap pair of wash-leather ones,&rdquo; said Stanley humbly.
&ldquo;I noticed Bell was wearing some in the coach this morning, so, as I was
passing the shop, I dashed in and got myself a pair. What are you smiling at?
You don&rsquo;t think it was wrong of me, do you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On the <i>con</i>-trary, darling,&rdquo; said Linda, &ldquo;I think it
was most sensible.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She pulled one of the large, pale gloves on her own fingers and looked at her
hand, turning it this way and that. She was still smiling.
</p>

<p>
Stanley wanted to say, &ldquo;I was thinking of you the whole time I bought
them.&rdquo; It was true, but for some reason he couldn&rsquo;t say it.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in,&rdquo; said he.
</p>

<h3>XII</h3>

<p>
Why does one feel so different at night? Why is it so exciting to be awake when
everybody else is asleep? Late&mdash;it is very late! And yet every moment you
feel more and more wakeful, as though you were slowly, almost with every
breath, waking up into a new, wonderful, far more thrilling and exciting world
than the daylight one. And what is this queer sensation that you&rsquo;re a
conspirator? Lightly, stealthily you move about your room. You take something
off the dressing-table and put it down again without a sound. And everything,
even the bed-post, knows you, responds, shares your secret....
</p>

<p>
You&rsquo;re not very fond of your room by day. You never think about it.
You&rsquo;re in and out, the door opens and slams, the cupboard creaks. You sit
down on the side of your bed, change your shoes and dash out again. A dive down
to the glass, two pins in your hair, powder your nose and off again. But
now&mdash;it&rsquo;s suddenly dear to you. It&rsquo;s a darling little funny
room. It&rsquo;s yours. Oh, what a joy it is to own things! Mine&mdash;my own!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My very own for ever?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Their lips met.
</p>

<p>
No, of course, that had nothing to do with it. That was all nonsense and
rubbish. But, in spite of herself, Beryl saw so plainly two people standing in
the middle of her room. Her arms were round his neck; he held her. And now he
whispered, &ldquo;My beauty, my little beauty!&rdquo; She jumped off her bed,
ran over to the window and kneeled on the window-seat, with her elbows on the
sill. But the beautiful night, the garden, every bush, every leaf, even the
white palings, even the stars, were conspirators too. So bright was the moon
that the flowers were bright as by day; the shadow of the nasturtiums,
exquisite lily-like leaves and wide-open flowers, lay across the silvery
veranda. The manuka-tree, bent by the southerly winds, was like a bird on one
leg stretching out a wing.
</p>

<p>
But when Beryl looked at the bush, it seemed to her the bush was sad.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We are dumb trees, reaching up in the night, imploring we know not
what,&rdquo; said the sorrowful bush.
</p>

<p>
It is true when you are by yourself and you think about life, it is always sad.
All that excitement and so on has a way of suddenly leaving you, and it&rsquo;s
as though, in the silence, somebody called your name, and you heard your name
for the first time. &ldquo;Beryl!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m here. I&rsquo;m Beryl. Who wants me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Beryl!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It is lonely living by oneself. Of course, there are relations, friends, heaps
of them; but that&rsquo;s not what she means. She wants some one who will find
the Beryl they none of them know, who will expect her to be that Beryl always.
She wants a lover.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take me away from all these other people, my love. Let us go far away.
Let us live our life, all new, all ours, from the very beginning. Let us make
our fire. Let us sit down to eat together. Let us have long talks at
night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And the thought was almost, &ldquo;Save me, my love. Save me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
... &ldquo;Oh, go on! Don&rsquo;t be a prude, my dear. You enjoy yourself while
you&rsquo;re young. That&rsquo;s my advice.&rdquo; And a high rush of silly
laughter joined Mrs. Harry Kember&rsquo;s loud, indifferent neigh.
</p>

<p>
You see, it&rsquo;s so frightfully difficult when you&rsquo;ve nobody.
You&rsquo;re so at the mercy of things. You can&rsquo;t just be rude. And
you&rsquo;ve always this horror of seeming inexperienced and stuffy like the
other ninnies at the Bay. And&mdash;and it&rsquo;s fascinating to know
you&rsquo;ve power over people. Yes, that is fascinating....
</p>

<p>
Oh why, oh why doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;he&rdquo; come soon?
</p>

<p>
If I go on living here, thought Beryl, anything may happen to me.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But how do you know he is coming at all?&rdquo; mocked a small voice
within her.
</p>

<p>
But Beryl dismissed it. She couldn&rsquo;t be left. Other people, perhaps, but
not she. It wasn&rsquo;t possible to think that Beryl Fairfield never married,
that lovely fascinating girl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you remember Beryl Fairfield?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Remember her! As if I could forget her! It was one summer at the Bay
that I saw her. She was standing on the beach in a blue&rdquo;&mdash;no,
pink&mdash;&ldquo;muslin frock, holding on a big cream&rdquo;&mdash;no,
black&mdash;&ldquo;straw hat. But it&rsquo;s years ago now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s as lovely as ever, more so if anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Beryl smiled, bit her lip, and gazed over the garden. As she gazed, she saw
somebody, a man, leave the road, step along the paddock beside their palings as
if he was coming straight towards her. Her heart beat. Who was it? Who could it
be? It couldn&rsquo;t be a burglar, certainly not a burglar, for he was smoking
and he strolled lightly. Beryl&rsquo;s heart leapt; it seemed to turn right
over, and then to stop. She recognized him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good evening, Miss Beryl,&rdquo; said the voice softly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good evening.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come for a little walk?&rdquo; it drawled.
</p>

<p>
Come for a walk&mdash;at that time of night! &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t.
Everybody&rsquo;s in bed. Everybody&rsquo;s asleep.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the voice lightly, and a whiff of sweet smoke reached
her. &ldquo;What does everybody matter? Do come! It&rsquo;s such a fine night.
There&rsquo;s not a soul about.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Beryl shook her head. But already something stirred in her, something reared
its head.
</p>

<p>
The voice said, &ldquo;Frightened?&rdquo; It mocked, &ldquo;Poor little
girl!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; said she. As she spoke that weak thing within
her seemed to uncoil, to grow suddenly tremendously strong; she longed to go!
</p>

<p>
And just as if this was quite understood by the other, the voice said, gently
and softly, but finally, &ldquo;Come along!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Beryl stepped over her low window, crossed the veranda, ran down the grass to
the gate. He was there before her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; breathed the voice, and it teased,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not frightened, are you? You&rsquo;re not
frightened?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was; now she was here she was terrified, and it seemed to her everything
was different. The moonlight stared and glittered; the shadows were like bars
of iron. Her hand was taken.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; she said lightly. &ldquo;Why should I
be?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her hand was pulled gently, tugged. She held back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not coming any farther,&rdquo; said Beryl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, rot!&rdquo; Harry Kember didn&rsquo;t believe her. &ldquo;Come
along! We&rsquo;ll just go as far as that fuchsia bush. Come along!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The fuchsia bush was tall. It fell over the fence in a shower. There was a
little pit of darkness beneath.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, really, I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; said Beryl.
</p>

<p>
For a moment Harry Kember didn&rsquo;t answer. Then he came close to her,
turned to her, smiled and said quickly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly!
Don&rsquo;t be silly!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His smile was something she&rsquo;d never seen before. Was he drunk? That
bright, blind, terrifying smile froze her with horror. What was she doing? How
had she got here? the stern garden asked her as the gate pushed open, and quick
as a cat Harry Kember came through and snatched her to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cold little devil! Cold little devil!&rdquo; said the hateful voice.
</p>

<p>
But Beryl was strong. She slipped, ducked, wrenched free.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are vile, vile,&rdquo; said she.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why in God&rsquo;s name did you come?&rdquo; stammered Harry
Kember.
</p>

<p>
Nobody answered him.
</p>

<p>
A cloud, small, serene, floated across the moon. In that moment of darkness the
sea sounded deep, troubled. Then the cloud sailed away, and the sound of the
sea was a vague murmur, as though it waked out of a dark dream. All was still.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p><a name="chap02"></a></p> <h2>The Garden-Party</h2>

<p>
And after all the weather was ideal. They could not have had a more perfect day
for a garden-party if they had ordered it. Windless, warm, the sky without a
cloud. Only the blue was veiled with a haze of light gold, as it is sometimes
in early summer. The gardener had been up since dawn, mowing the lawns and
sweeping them, until the grass and the dark flat rosettes where the daisy
plants had been seemed to shine. As for the roses, you could not help feeling
they understood that roses are the only flowers that impress people at
garden-parties; the only flowers that everybody is certain of knowing.
Hundreds, yes, literally hundreds, had come out in a single night; the green
bushes bowed down as though they had been visited by archangels.
</p>

<p>
Breakfast was not yet over before the men came to put up the marquee.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where do you want the marquee put, mother?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear child, it&rsquo;s no use asking me. I&rsquo;m determined to
leave everything to you children this year. Forget I am your mother. Treat me
as an honoured guest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Meg could not possibly go and supervise the men. She had washed her hair
before breakfast, and she sat drinking her coffee in a green turban, with a
dark wet curl stamped on each cheek. Jose, the butterfly, always came down in a
silk petticoat and a kimono jacket.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to go, Laura; you&rsquo;re the artistic one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Away Laura flew, still holding her piece of bread-and-butter. It&rsquo;s so
delicious to have an excuse for eating out of doors, and besides, she loved
having to arrange things; she always felt she could do it so much better than
anybody else.
</p>

<p>
Four men in their shirt-sleeves stood grouped together on the garden path. They
carried staves covered with rolls of canvas, and they had big tool-bags slung
on their backs. They looked impressive. Laura wished now that she had not got
the bread-and-butter, but there was nowhere to put it, and she couldn&rsquo;t
possibly throw it away. She blushed and tried to look severe and even a little
bit short-sighted as she came up to them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; she said, copying her mother&rsquo;s voice. But
that sounded so fearfully affected that she was ashamed, and stammered like a
little girl, &ldquo;Oh&mdash;er&mdash;have you come&mdash;is it about the
marquee?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, miss,&rdquo; said the tallest of the men, a lanky,
freckled fellow, and he shifted his tool-bag, knocked back his straw hat and
smiled down at her. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His smile was so easy, so friendly that Laura recovered. What nice eyes he had,
small, but such a dark blue! And now she looked at the others, they were
smiling too. &ldquo;Cheer up, we won&rsquo;t bite,&rdquo; their smile seemed to
say. How very nice workmen were! And what a beautiful morning! She
mustn&rsquo;t mention the morning; she must be business-like. The marquee.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what about the lily-lawn? Would that do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And she pointed to the lily-lawn with the hand that didn&rsquo;t hold the
bread-and-butter. They turned, they stared in the direction. A little fat chap
thrust out his under-lip, and the tall fellow frowned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fancy it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Not conspicuous enough.
You see, with a thing like a marquee,&rdquo; and he turned to Laura in his easy
way, &ldquo;you want to put it somewhere where it&rsquo;ll give you a bang slap
in the eye, if you follow me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Laura&rsquo;s upbringing made her wonder for a moment whether it was quite
respectful of a workman to talk to her of bangs slap in the eye. But she did
quite follow him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A corner of the tennis-court,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;But the
band&rsquo;s going to be in one corner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, going to have a band, are you?&rdquo; said another of the
workmen. He was pale. He had a haggard look as his dark eyes scanned the
tennis-court. What was he thinking?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only a very small band,&rdquo; said Laura gently. Perhaps he
wouldn&rsquo;t mind so much if the band was quite small. But the tall fellow
interrupted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, miss, that&rsquo;s the place. Against those trees. Over
there. That&rsquo;ll do fine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Against the karakas. Then the karaka-trees would be hidden. And they were so
lovely, with their broad, gleaming leaves, and their clusters of yellow fruit.
They were like trees you imagined growing on a desert island, proud, solitary,
lifting their leaves and fruits to the sun in a kind of silent splendour. Must
they be hidden by a marquee?
</p>

<p>
They must. Already the men had shouldered their staves and were making for the
place. Only the tall fellow was left. He bent down, pinched a sprig of
lavender, put his thumb and forefinger to his nose and snuffed up the smell.
When Laura saw that gesture she forgot all about the karakas in her wonder at
him caring for things like that&mdash;caring for the smell of lavender. How
many men that she knew would have done such a thing? Oh, how extraordinarily
nice workmen were, she thought. Why couldn&rsquo;t she have workmen for her
friends rather than the silly boys she danced with and who came to Sunday night
supper? She would get on much better with men like these.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s all the fault, she decided, as the tall fellow drew something on the
back of an envelope, something that was to be looped up or left to hang, of
these absurd class distinctions. Well, for her part, she didn&rsquo;t feel
them. Not a bit, not an atom.... And now there came the chock-chock of wooden
hammers. Some one whistled, some one sang out, &ldquo;Are you right there,
matey?&rdquo; &ldquo;Matey!&rdquo; The friendliness of it,
the&mdash;the&mdash;Just to prove how happy she was, just to show the tall
fellow how at home she felt, and how she despised stupid conventions, Laura
took a big bite of her bread-and-butter as she stared at the little drawing.
She felt just like a work-girl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Laura, Laura, where are you? Telephone, Laura!&rdquo; a voice cried from
the house.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Coming!&rdquo; Away she skimmed, over the lawn, up the path, up the
steps, across the veranda, and into the porch. In the hall her father and
Laurie were brushing their hats ready to go to the office.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, Laura,&rdquo; said Laurie very fast, &ldquo;you might just give a
squiz at my coat before this afternoon. See if it wants pressing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said she. Suddenly she couldn&rsquo;t stop herself. She
ran at Laurie and gave him a small, quick squeeze. &ldquo;Oh, I do love
parties, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; gasped Laura.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ra-ther,&rdquo; said Laurie&rsquo;s warm, boyish voice, and he squeezed
his sister too, and gave her a gentle push. &ldquo;Dash off to the telephone,
old girl.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The telephone. &ldquo;Yes, yes; oh yes. Kitty? Good morning, dear. Come to
lunch? Do, dear. Delighted of course. It will only be a very scratch
meal&mdash;just the sandwich crusts and broken meringue-shells and what&rsquo;s
left over. Yes, isn&rsquo;t it a perfect morning? Your white? Oh, I certainly
should. One moment&mdash;hold the line. Mother&rsquo;s calling.&rdquo; And
Laura sat back. &ldquo;What, mother? Can&rsquo;t hear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sheridan&rsquo;s voice floated down the stairs. &ldquo;Tell her to wear
that sweet hat she had on last Sunday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mother says you&rsquo;re to wear that <i>sweet</i> hat you had on last
Sunday. Good. One o&rsquo;clock. Bye-bye.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Laura put back the receiver, flung her arms over her head, took a deep breath,
stretched and let them fall. &ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; she sighed, and the moment
after the sigh she sat up quickly. She was still, listening. All the doors in
the house seemed to be open. The house was alive with soft, quick steps and
running voices. The green baize door that led to the kitchen regions swung open
and shut with a muffled thud. And now there came a long, chuckling absurd
sound. It was the heavy piano being moved on its stiff castors. But the air! If
you stopped to notice, was the air always like this? Little faint winds were
playing chase, in at the tops of the windows, out at the doors. And there were
two tiny spots of sun, one on the inkpot, one on a silver photograph frame,
playing too. Darling little spots. Especially the one on the inkpot lid. It was
quite warm. A warm little silver star. She could have kissed it.
</p>

<p>
The front door bell pealed, and there sounded the rustle of Sadie&rsquo;s print
skirt on the stairs. A man&rsquo;s voice murmured; Sadie answered, careless,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. Wait. I&rsquo;ll ask Mrs
Sheridan.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it, Sadie?&rdquo; Laura came into the hall.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the florist, Miss Laura.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was, indeed. There, just inside the door, stood a wide, shallow tray full of
pots of pink lilies. No other kind. Nothing but lilies&mdash;canna lilies, big
pink flowers, wide open, radiant, almost frighteningly alive on bright crimson
stems.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O-oh, Sadie!&rdquo; said Laura, and the sound was like a little moan.
She crouched down as if to warm herself at that blaze of lilies; she felt they
were in her fingers, on her lips, growing in her breast.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s some mistake,&rdquo; she said faintly. &ldquo;Nobody ever
ordered so many. Sadie, go and find mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But at that moment Mrs. Sheridan joined them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite right,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;Yes, I ordered
them. Aren&rsquo;t they lovely?&rdquo; She pressed Laura&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;I
was passing the shop yesterday, and I saw them in the window. And I suddenly
thought for once in my life I shall have enough canna lilies. The garden-party
will be a good excuse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I thought you said you didn&rsquo;t mean to interfere,&rdquo; said
Laura. Sadie had gone. The florist&rsquo;s man was still outside at his van.
She put her arm round her mother&rsquo;s neck and gently, very gently, she bit
her mother&rsquo;s ear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My darling child, you wouldn&rsquo;t like a logical mother, would you?
Don&rsquo;t do that. Here&rsquo;s the man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He carried more lilies still, another whole tray.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bank them up, just inside the door, on both sides of the porch,
please,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sheridan. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you agree, Laura?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I <i>do</i>, mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In the drawing-room Meg, Jose and good little Hans had at last succeeded in
moving the piano.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, if we put this chesterfield against the wall and move everything
out of the room except the chairs, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hans, move these tables into the smoking-room, and bring a sweeper to
take these marks off the carpet and&mdash;one moment, Hans&mdash;&rdquo; Jose
loved giving orders to the servants, and they loved obeying her. She always
made them feel they were taking part in some drama. &ldquo;Tell mother and Miss
Laura to come here at once.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good, Miss Jose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She turned to Meg. &ldquo;I want to hear what the piano sounds like, just in
case I&rsquo;m asked to sing this afternoon. Let&rsquo;s try over &lsquo;This
life is Weary.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<i>Pom!</i> Ta-ta-ta <i>Tee</i>-ta! The piano burst out so passionately that
Jose&rsquo;s face changed. She clasped her hands. She looked mournfully and
enigmatically at her mother and Laura as they came in.
</p>

This Life is <i>Wee</i>-ary,<br />
A Tear&mdash;a Sigh.<br />
A Love that <i>Chan</i>-ges,<br />
And then. . . Good-bye!
</p>

<p>
But at the word &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; and although the piano sounded more
desperate than ever, her face broke into a brilliant, dreadfully unsympathetic
smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t I in good voice, mummy?&rdquo; she beamed.
</p>

<p>
But now Sadie interrupted them. &ldquo;What is it, Sadie?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you please, m&rsquo;m, cook says have you got the flags for the
sandwiches?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The flags for the sandwiches, Sadie?&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Sheridan
dreamily. And the children knew by her face that she hadn&rsquo;t got them.
&ldquo;Let me see.&rdquo; And she said to Sadie firmly, &ldquo;Tell cook
I&rsquo;ll let her have them in ten minutes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sadie went.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, Laura,&rdquo; said her mother quickly, &ldquo;come with me into the
smoking-room. I&rsquo;ve got the names somewhere on the back of an envelope.
You&rsquo;ll have to write them out for me. Meg, go upstairs this minute and
take that wet thing off your head. Jose, run and finish dressing this instant.
Do you hear me, children, or shall I have to tell your father when he comes
home to-night? And&mdash;and, Jose, pacify cook if you do go into the kitchen,
will you? I&rsquo;m terrified of her this morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The envelope was found at last behind the dining-room clock, though how it had
got there Mrs. Sheridan could not imagine.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One of you children must have stolen it out of my bag, because I
remember vividly&mdash;cream-cheese and lemon-curd. Have you done that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Egg and&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Sheridan held the envelope away from her.
&ldquo;It looks like mice. It can&rsquo;t be mice, can it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Olive, pet,&rdquo; said Laura, looking over her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, of course, olive. What a horrible combination it sounds. Egg and
olive.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They were finished at last, and Laura took them off to the kitchen. She found
Jose there pacifying the cook, who did not look at all terrifying.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have never seen such exquisite sandwiches,&rdquo; said Jose&rsquo;s
rapturous voice. &ldquo;How many kinds did you say there were, cook?
Fifteen?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fifteen, Miss Jose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, cook, I congratulate you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Cook swept up crusts with the long sandwich knife, and smiled broadly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Godber&rsquo;s has come,&rdquo; announced Sadie, issuing out of the
pantry. She had seen the man pass the window.
</p>

<p>
That meant the cream puffs had come. Godber&rsquo;s were famous for their cream
puffs. Nobody ever thought of making them at home.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bring them in and put them on the table, my girl,&rdquo; ordered cook.
</p>

<p>
Sadie brought them in and went back to the door. Of course Laura and Jose were
far too grown-up to really care about such things. All the same, they
couldn&rsquo;t help agreeing that the puffs looked very attractive. Very. Cook
began arranging them, shaking off the extra icing sugar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they carry one back to all one&rsquo;s parties?&rdquo; said
Laura.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose they do,&rdquo; said practical Jose, who never liked to be
carried back. &ldquo;They look beautifully light and feathery, I must
say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have one each, my dears,&rdquo; said cook in her comfortable voice.
&ldquo;Yer ma won&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oh, impossible. Fancy cream puffs so soon after breakfast. The very idea made
one shudder. All the same, two minutes later Jose and Laura were licking their
fingers with that absorbed inward look that only comes from whipped cream.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go into the garden, out by the back way,&rdquo; suggested
Laura. &ldquo;I want to see how the men are getting on with the marquee.
They&rsquo;re such awfully nice men.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But the back door was blocked by cook, Sadie, Godber&rsquo;s man and Hans.
</p>

<p>
Something had happened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tuk-tuk-tuk,&rdquo; clucked cook like an agitated hen. Sadie had her
hand clapped to her cheek as though she had toothache. Hans&rsquo;s face was
screwed up in the effort to understand. Only Godber&rsquo;s man seemed to be
enjoying himself; it was his story.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a horrible accident,&rdquo; said Cook. &ldquo;A man
killed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A man killed! Where? How? When?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Godber&rsquo;s man wasn&rsquo;t going to have his story snatched from under
his very nose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Know those little cottages just below here, miss?&rdquo; Know them? Of
course, she knew them. &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s a young chap living there,
name of Scott, a carter. His horse shied at a traction-engine, corner of Hawke
Street this morning, and he was thrown out on the back of his head.
Killed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; Laura stared at Godber&rsquo;s man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dead when they picked him up,&rdquo; said Godber&rsquo;s man with
relish. &ldquo;They were taking the body home as I come up here.&rdquo; And he
said to the cook, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s left a wife and five little ones.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jose, come here.&rdquo; Laura caught hold of her sister&rsquo;s sleeve
and dragged her through the kitchen to the other side of the green baize door.
There she paused and leaned against it. &ldquo;Jose!&rdquo; she said,
horrified, &ldquo;however are we going to stop everything?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop everything, Laura!&rdquo; cried Jose in astonishment. &ldquo;What
do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop the garden-party, of course.&rdquo; Why did Jose pretend?
</p>

<p>
But Jose was still more amazed. &ldquo;Stop the garden-party? My dear Laura,
don&rsquo;t be so absurd. Of course we can&rsquo;t do anything of the kind.
Nobody expects us to. Don&rsquo;t be so extravagant.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t possibly have a garden-party with a man dead just
outside the front gate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That really was extravagant, for the little cottages were in a lane to
themselves at the very bottom of a steep rise that led up to the house. A broad
road ran between. True, they were far too near. They were the greatest possible
eyesore, and they had no right to be in that neighbourhood at all. They were
little mean dwellings painted a chocolate brown. In the garden patches there
was nothing but cabbage stalks, sick hens and tomato cans. The very smoke
coming out of their chimneys was poverty-stricken. Little rags and shreds of
smoke, so unlike the great silvery plumes that uncurled from the
Sheridans&rsquo; chimneys. Washerwomen lived in the lane and sweeps and a
cobbler, and a man whose house-front was studded all over with minute
bird-cages. Children swarmed. When the Sheridans were little they were
forbidden to set foot there because of the revolting language and of what they
might catch. But since they were grown up, Laura and Laurie on their prowls
sometimes walked through. It was disgusting and sordid. They came out with a
shudder. But still one must go everywhere; one must see everything. So through
they went.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And just think of what the band would sound like to that poor
woman,&rdquo; said Laura.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Laura!&rdquo; Jose began to be seriously annoyed. &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;re going to stop a band playing every time some one has an accident,
you&rsquo;ll lead a very strenuous life. I&rsquo;m every bit as sorry about it
as you. I feel just as sympathetic.&rdquo; Her eyes hardened. She looked at her
sister just as she used to when they were little and fighting together.
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t bring a drunken workman back to life by being
sentimental,&rdquo; she said softly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Drunk! Who said he was drunk?&rdquo; Laura turned furiously on Jose. She
said, just as they had used to say on those occasions, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
straight up to tell mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do, dear,&rdquo; cooed Jose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mother, can I come into your room?&rdquo; Laura turned the big glass
door-knob.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course, child. Why, what&rsquo;s the matter? What&rsquo;s given you
such a colour?&rdquo; And Mrs. Sheridan turned round from her dressing-table.
She was trying on a new hat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mother, a man&rsquo;s been killed,&rdquo; began Laura.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Not</i> in the garden?&rdquo; interrupted her mother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, what a fright you gave me!&rdquo; Mrs. Sheridan sighed with relief,
and took off the big hat and held it on her knees.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But listen, mother,&rdquo; said Laura. Breathless, half-choking, she
told the dreadful story. &ldquo;Of course, we can&rsquo;t have our party, can
we?&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;The band and everybody arriving. They&rsquo;d
hear us, mother; they&rsquo;re nearly neighbours!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
To Laura&rsquo;s astonishment her mother behaved just like Jose; it was harder
to bear because she seemed amused. She refused to take Laura seriously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, my dear child, use your common sense. It&rsquo;s only by accident
we&rsquo;ve heard of it. If some one had died there normally&mdash;and I
can&rsquo;t understand how they keep alive in those poky little holes&mdash;we
should still be having our party, shouldn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Laura had to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to that, but she felt it was all wrong. She
sat down on her mother&rsquo;s sofa and pinched the cushion frill.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mother, isn&rsquo;t it terribly heartless of us?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Darling!&rdquo; Mrs. Sheridan got up and came over to her, carrying the
hat. Before Laura could stop her she had popped it on. &ldquo;My child!&rdquo;
said her mother, &ldquo;the hat is yours. It&rsquo;s made for you. It&rsquo;s
much too young for me. I have never seen you look such a picture. Look at
yourself!&rdquo; And she held up her hand-mirror.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, mother,&rdquo; Laura began again. She couldn&rsquo;t look at
herself; she turned aside.
</p>

<p>
This time Mrs. Sheridan lost patience just as Jose had done.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are being very absurd, Laura,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;People
like that don&rsquo;t expect sacrifices from us. And it&rsquo;s not very
sympathetic to spoil everybody&rsquo;s enjoyment as you&rsquo;re doing
now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Laura, and she walked quickly out
of the room into her own bedroom. There, quite by chance, the first thing she
saw was this charming girl in the mirror, in her black hat trimmed with gold
daisies, and a long black velvet ribbon. Never had she imagined she could look
like that. Is mother right? she thought. And now she hoped her mother was
right. Am I being extravagant? Perhaps it was extravagant. Just for a moment
she had another glimpse of that poor woman and those little children, and the
body being carried into the house. But it all seemed blurred, unreal, like a
picture in the newspaper. I&rsquo;ll remember it again after the party&rsquo;s
over, she decided. And somehow that seemed quite the best plan....
</p>

<p>
Lunch was over by half-past one. By half-past two they were all ready for the
fray. The green-coated band had arrived and was established in a corner of the
tennis-court.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; trilled Kitty Maitland, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t they too
like frogs for words? You ought to have arranged them round the pond with the
conductor in the middle on a leaf.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Laurie arrived and hailed them on his way to dress. At the sight of him Laura
remembered the accident again. She wanted to tell him. If Laurie agreed with
the others, then it was bound to be all right. And she followed him into the
hall.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Laurie!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; He was half-way upstairs, but when he turned round and saw
Laura he suddenly puffed out his cheeks and goggled his eyes at her. &ldquo;My
word, Laura! You do look stunning,&rdquo; said Laurie. &ldquo;What an
absolutely topping hat!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Laura said faintly &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; and smiled up at Laurie, and
didn&rsquo;t tell him after all.
</p>

<p>
Soon after that people began coming in streams. The band struck up; the hired
waiters ran from the house to the marquee. Wherever you looked there were
couples strolling, bending to the flowers, greeting, moving on over the lawn.
They were like bright birds that had alighted in the Sheridans&rsquo; garden
for this one afternoon, on their way to&mdash;where? Ah, what happiness it is
to be with people who all are happy, to press hands, press cheeks, smile into
eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Darling Laura, how well you look!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a becoming hat, child!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Laura, you look quite Spanish. I&rsquo;ve never seen you look so
striking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Laura, glowing, answered softly, &ldquo;Have you had tea? Won&rsquo;t you
have an ice? The passion-fruit ices really are rather special.&rdquo; She ran
to her father and begged him. &ldquo;Daddy darling, can&rsquo;t the band have
something to drink?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And the perfect afternoon slowly ripened, slowly faded, slowly its petals
closed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never a more delightful garden-party....&rdquo; &ldquo;The greatest
success....&rdquo; &ldquo;Quite the most....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Laura helped her mother with the good-byes. They stood side by side in the
porch till it was all over.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All over, all over, thank heaven,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sheridan.
&ldquo;Round up the others, Laura. Let&rsquo;s go and have some fresh coffee.
I&rsquo;m exhausted. Yes, it&rsquo;s been very successful. But oh, these
parties, these parties! Why will you children insist on giving parties!&rdquo;
And they all of them sat down in the deserted marquee.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have a sandwich, daddy dear. I wrote the flag.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Mr. Sheridan took a bite and the sandwich was gone. He
took another. &ldquo;I suppose you didn&rsquo;t hear of a beastly accident that
happened to-day?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sheridan, holding up her hand, &ldquo;we did.
It nearly ruined the party. Laura insisted we should put it off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, mother!&rdquo; Laura didn&rsquo;t want to be teased about it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was a horrible affair all the same,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheridan.
&ldquo;The chap was married too. Lived just below in the lane, and leaves a
wife and half a dozen kiddies, so they say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
An awkward little silence fell. Mrs. Sheridan fidgeted with her cup. Really, it
was very tactless of father....
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she looked up. There on the table were all those sandwiches, cakes,
puffs, all uneaten, all going to be wasted. She had one of her brilliant ideas.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make up a basket.
Let&rsquo;s send that poor creature some of this perfectly good food. At any
rate, it will be the greatest treat for the children. Don&rsquo;t you agree?
And she&rsquo;s sure to have neighbours calling in and so on. What a point to
have it all ready prepared. Laura!&rdquo; She jumped up. &ldquo;Get me the big
basket out of the stairs cupboard.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, mother, do you really think it&rsquo;s a good idea?&rdquo; said
Laura.
</p>

<p>
Again, how curious, she seemed to be different from them all. To take scraps
from their party. Would the poor woman really like that?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course! What&rsquo;s the matter with you to-day? An hour or two ago
you were insisting on us being sympathetic, and now&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oh well! Laura ran for the basket. It was filled, it was heaped by her mother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take it yourself, darling,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Run down just as you
are. No, wait, take the arum lilies too. People of that class are so impressed
by arum lilies.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The stems will ruin her lace frock,&rdquo; said practical Jose.
</p>

<p>
So they would. Just in time. &ldquo;Only the basket, then. And,
Laura!&rdquo;&mdash;her mother followed her out of the
marquee&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t on any account&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What mother?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
No, better not put such ideas into the child&rsquo;s head! &ldquo;Nothing! Run
along.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was just growing dusky as Laura shut their garden gates. A big dog ran by
like a shadow. The road gleamed white, and down below in the hollow the little
cottages were in deep shade. How quiet it seemed after the afternoon. Here she
was going down the hill to somewhere where a man lay dead, and she
couldn&rsquo;t realize it. Why couldn&rsquo;t she? She stopped a minute. And it
seemed to her that kisses, voices, tinkling spoons, laughter, the smell of
crushed grass were somehow inside her. She had no room for anything else. How
strange! She looked up at the pale sky, and all she thought was, &ldquo;Yes, it
was the most successful party.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Now the broad road was crossed. The lane began, smoky and dark. Women in shawls
and men&rsquo;s tweed caps hurried by. Men hung over the palings; the children
played in the doorways. A low hum came from the mean little cottages. In some
of them there was a flicker of light, and a shadow, crab-like, moved across the
window. Laura bent her head and hurried on. She wished now she had put on a
coat. How her frock shone! And the big hat with the velvet streamer&mdash;if
only it was another hat! Were the people looking at her? They must be. It was a
mistake to have come; she knew all along it was a mistake. Should she go back
even now?
</p>

<p>
No, too late. This was the house. It must be. A dark knot of people stood
outside. Beside the gate an old, old woman with a crutch sat in a chair,
watching. She had her feet on a newspaper. The voices stopped as Laura drew
near. The group parted. It was as though she was expected, as though they had
known she was coming here.
</p>

<p>
Laura was terribly nervous. Tossing the velvet ribbon over her shoulder, she
said to a woman standing by, &ldquo;Is this Mrs. Scott&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;
and the woman, smiling queerly, said, &ldquo;It is, my lass.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oh, to be away from this! She actually said, &ldquo;Help me, God,&rdquo; as she
walked up the tiny path and knocked. To be away from those staring eyes, or to
be covered up in anything, one of those women&rsquo;s shawls even. I&rsquo;ll
just leave the basket and go, she decided. I shan&rsquo;t even wait for it to
be emptied.
</p>

<p>
Then the door opened. A little woman in black showed in the gloom.
</p>

<p>
Laura said, &ldquo;Are you Mrs. Scott?&rdquo; But to her horror the woman
answered, &ldquo;Walk in please, miss,&rdquo; and she was shut in the passage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Laura, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to come in. I only want
to leave this basket. Mother sent&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The little woman in the gloomy passage seemed not to have heard her.
&ldquo;Step this way, please, miss,&rdquo; she said in an oily voice, and Laura
followed her.
</p>

<p>
She found herself in a wretched little low kitchen, lighted by a smoky lamp.
There was a woman sitting before the fire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Em,&rdquo; said the little creature who had let her in. &ldquo;Em!
It&rsquo;s a young lady.&rdquo; She turned to Laura. She said meaningly,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m &rsquo;er sister, miss. You&rsquo;ll excuse &rsquo;er,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, but of course!&rdquo; said Laura. &ldquo;Please, please don&rsquo;t
disturb her. I&mdash;I only want to leave&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But at that moment the woman at the fire turned round. Her face, puffed up,
red, with swollen eyes and swollen lips, looked terrible. She seemed as though
she couldn&rsquo;t understand why Laura was there. What did it mean? Why was
this stranger standing in the kitchen with a basket? What was it all about? And
the poor face puckered up again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, my dear,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll thenk the
young lady.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And again she began, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse her, miss, I&rsquo;m
sure,&rdquo; and her face, swollen too, tried an oily smile.
</p>

<p>
Laura only wanted to get out, to get away. She was back in the passage. The
door opened. She walked straight through into the bedroom, where the dead man
was lying.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d like a look at &rsquo;im, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said
Em&rsquo;s sister, and she brushed past Laura over to the bed.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, my lass,&rdquo;&mdash;and now her voice sounded
fond and sly, and fondly she drew down the sheet&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;e looks a
picture. There&rsquo;s nothing to show. Come along, my dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Laura came.
</p>

<p>
There lay a young man, fast asleep&mdash;sleeping so soundly, so deeply, that
he was far, far away from them both. Oh, so remote, so peaceful. He was
dreaming. Never wake him up again. His head was sunk in the pillow, his eyes
were closed; they were blind under the closed eyelids. He was given up to his
dream. What did garden-parties and baskets and lace frocks matter to him? He
was far from all those things. He was wonderful, beautiful. While they were
laughing and while the band was playing, this marvel had come to the lane.
Happy... happy.... All is well, said that sleeping face. This is just as it
should be. I am content.
</p>

<p>
But all the same you had to cry, and she couldn&rsquo;t go out of the room
without saying something to him. Laura gave a loud childish sob.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Forgive my hat,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
And this time she didn&rsquo;t wait for Em&rsquo;s sister. She found her way
out of the door, down the path, past all those dark people. At the corner of
the lane she met Laurie.
</p>

<p>
He stepped out of the shadow. &ldquo;Is that you, Laura?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mother was getting anxious. Was it all right?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, quite. Oh, Laurie!&rdquo; She took his arm, she pressed up against
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, you&rsquo;re not crying, are you?&rdquo; asked her brother.
</p>

<p>
Laura shook her head. She was.
</p>

<p>
Laurie put his arm round her shoulder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; he said
in his warm, loving voice. &ldquo;Was it awful?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; sobbed Laura. &ldquo;It was simply marvellous. But
Laurie&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped, she looked at her brother. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
life,&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t life&mdash;&rdquo; But what life
was she couldn&rsquo;t explain. No matter. He quite understood.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Isn&rsquo;t</i> it, darling?&rdquo; said Laurie.

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
The week after was one of the busiest weeks of their lives. Even when they went
to bed it was only their bodies that lay down and rested; their minds went on,
thinking things out, talking things over, wondering, deciding, trying to
remember where....
</p>

<p>
Constantia lay like a statue, her hands by her sides, her feet just overlapping
each other, the sheet up to her chin. She stared at the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think father would mind if we gave his top-hat to the
porter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The porter?&rdquo; snapped Josephine. &ldquo;Why ever the porter? What a
very extraordinary idea!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Constantia slowly, &ldquo;he must often have to go
to funerals. And I noticed at&mdash;at the cemetery that he only had a
bowler.&rdquo; She paused. &ldquo;I thought then how very much he&rsquo;d
appreciate a top-hat. We ought to give him a present, too. He was always very
nice to father.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried Josephine, flouncing on her pillow and staring across
the dark at Constantia, &ldquo;father&rsquo;s head!&rdquo; And suddenly, for
one awful moment, she nearly giggled. Not, of course, that she felt in the
least like giggling. It must have been habit. Years ago, when they had stayed
awake at night talking, their beds had simply heaved. And now the
porter&rsquo;s head, disappearing, popped out, like a candle, under
father&rsquo;s hat.... The giggle mounted, mounted; she clenched her hands; she
fought it down; she frowned fiercely at the dark and said
&ldquo;Remember&rdquo; terribly sternly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We can decide to-morrow,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
Constantia had noticed nothing; she sighed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think we ought to have our dressing-gowns dyed as well?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Black?&rdquo; almost shrieked Josephine.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what else?&rdquo; said Constantia. &ldquo;I was thinking&mdash;it
doesn&rsquo;t seem quite sincere, in a way, to wear black out of doors and when
we&rsquo;re fully dressed, and then when we&rsquo;re at home&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But nobody sees us,&rdquo; said Josephine. She gave the bedclothes such
a twitch that both her feet became uncovered, and she had to creep up the
pillows to get them well under again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Kate does,&rdquo; said Constantia. &ldquo;And the postman very well
might.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Josephine thought of her dark-red slippers, which matched her dressing-gown,
and of Constantia&rsquo;s favourite indefinite green ones which went with hers.
Black! Two black dressing-gowns and two pairs of black woolly slippers,
creeping off to the bathroom like black cats.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary,&rdquo; said she.
</p>

<p>
Silence. Then Constantia said, &ldquo;We shall have to post the papers with the
notice in them to-morrow to catch the Ceylon mail.... How many letters have we
had up till now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Twenty-three.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Josephine had replied to them all, and twenty-three times when she came to
&ldquo;We miss our dear father so much&rdquo; she had broken down and had to
use her handkerchief, and on some of them even to soak up a very light-blue
tear with an edge of blotting-paper. Strange! She couldn&rsquo;t have put it
on&mdash;but twenty-three times. Even now, though, when she said over to
herself sadly &ldquo;We miss our dear father <i>so</i> much,&rdquo; she could
have cried if she&rsquo;d wanted to.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you got enough stamps?&rdquo; came from Constantia.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, how can I tell?&rdquo; said Josephine crossly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the good of asking me that now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was just wondering,&rdquo; said Constantia mildly.
</p>

<p>
Silence again. There came a little rustle, a scurry, a hop.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A mouse,&rdquo; said Constantia.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be a mouse because there aren&rsquo;t any crumbs,&rdquo;
said Josephine.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t know there aren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Constantia.
</p>

<p>
A spasm of pity squeezed her heart. Poor little thing! She wished she&rsquo;d
left a tiny piece of biscuit on the dressing-table. It was awful to think of it
not finding anything. What would it do?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think how they manage to live at all,&rdquo; she said
slowly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; demanded Josephine.
</p>

<p>
And Constantia said more loudly than she meant to, &ldquo;Mice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Josephine was furious. &ldquo;Oh, what nonsense, Con!&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;What have mice got to do with it? You&rsquo;re asleep.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I am,&rdquo; said Constantia. She shut her eyes to
make sure. She was.
</p>

<p>
Josephine arched her spine, pulled up her knees, folded her arms so that her
fists came under her ears, and pressed her cheek hard against the pillow.
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
Another thing which complicated matters was they had Nurse Andrews staying on
with them that week. It was their own fault; they had asked her. It was
Josephine&rsquo;s idea. On the morning&mdash;well, on the last morning, when
the doctor had gone, Josephine had said to Constantia, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
think it would be rather nice if we asked Nurse Andrews to stay on for a week
as our guest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very nice,&rdquo; said Constantia.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; went on Josephine quickly, &ldquo;I should just say
this afternoon, after I&rsquo;ve paid her, &lsquo;My sister and I would be very
pleased, after all you&rsquo;ve done for us, Nurse Andrews, if you would stay
on for a week as our guest.&rsquo; I&rsquo;d have to put that in about being
our guest in case&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, but she could hardly expect to be paid!&rdquo; cried Constantia.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One never knows,&rdquo; said Josephine sagely.
</p>

<p>
Nurse Andrews had, of course, jumped at the idea. But it was a bother. It meant
they had to have regular sit-down meals at the proper times, whereas if
they&rsquo;d been alone they could just have asked Kate if she wouldn&rsquo;t
have minded bringing them a tray wherever they were. And meal-times now that
the strain was over were rather a trial.
</p>

<p>
Nurse Andrews was simply fearful about butter. Really they couldn&rsquo;t help
feeling that about butter, at least, she took advantage of their kindness. And
she had that maddening habit of asking for just an inch more of bread to finish
what she had on her plate, and then, at the last mouthful,
absent-mindedly&mdash;of course it wasn&rsquo;t absent-mindedly&mdash;taking
another helping. Josephine got very red when this happened, and she fastened
her small, bead-like eyes on the tablecloth as if she saw a minute strange
insect creeping through the web of it. But Constantia&rsquo;s long, pale face
lengthened and set, and she gazed away&mdash;away&mdash;far over the desert, to
where that line of camels unwound like a thread of wool....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When I was with Lady Tukes,&rdquo; said Nurse Andrews, &ldquo;she had
such a dainty little contrayvance for the buttah. It was a silvah Cupid
balanced on the&mdash;on the bordah of a glass dish, holding a tayny fork. And
when you wanted some buttah you simply pressed his foot and he bent down and
speared you a piece. It was quite a gayme.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Josephine could hardly bear that. But &ldquo;I think those things are very
extravagant&rdquo; was all she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But whey?&rdquo; asked Nurse Andrews, beaming through her eyeglasses.
&ldquo;No one, surely, would take more buttah than one wanted&mdash;would
one?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ring, Con,&rdquo; cried Josephine. She couldn&rsquo;t trust herself to
reply.
</p>

<p>
And proud young Kate, the enchanted princess, came in to see what the old
tabbies wanted now. She snatched away their plates of mock something or other
and slapped down a white, terrified blancmange.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jam, please, Kate,&rdquo; said Josephine kindly.
</p>

<p>
Kate knelt and burst open the sideboard, lifted the lid of the jam-pot, saw it
was empty, put it on the table, and stalked off.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Nurse Andrews a moment later, &ldquo;there
isn&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, what a bother!&rdquo; said Josephine. She bit her lip. &ldquo;What
had we better do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Constantia looked dubious. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t disturb Kate again,&rdquo; she
said softly.
</p>

<p>
Nurse Andrews waited, smiling at them both. Her eyes wandered, spying at
everything behind her eyeglasses. Constantia in despair went back to her
camels. Josephine frowned heavily&mdash;concentrated. If it hadn&rsquo;t been
for this idiotic woman she and Con would, of course, have eaten their
blancmange without. Suddenly the idea came.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Marmalade. There&rsquo;s some marmalade
in the sideboard. Get it, Con.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; laughed Nurse Andrews&mdash;and her laugh was like a
spoon tinkling against a medicine-glass&mdash;&ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s not very
bittah marmalayde.&rdquo;
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
But, after all, it was not long now, and then she&rsquo;d be gone for good. And
there was no getting over the fact that she had been very kind to father. She
had nursed him day and night at the end. Indeed, both Constantia and Josephine
felt privately she had rather overdone the not leaving him at the very last.
For when they had gone in to say good-bye Nurse Andrews had sat beside his bed
the whole time, holding his wrist and pretending to look at her watch. It
couldn&rsquo;t have been necessary. It was so tactless, too. Supposing father
had wanted to say something&mdash;something private to them. Not that he had.
Oh, far from it! He lay there, purple, a dark, angry purple in the face, and
never even looked at them when they came in. Then, as they were standing there,
wondering what to do, he had suddenly opened one eye. Oh, what a difference it
would have made, what a difference to their memory of him, how much easier to
tell people about it, if he had only opened both! But no&mdash;one eye only. It
glared at them a moment and then... went out.
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
It had made it very awkward for them when Mr. Farolles, of St. John&rsquo;s,
called the same afternoon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The end was quite peaceful, I trust?&rdquo; were the first words he said
as he glided towards them through the dark drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; said Josephine faintly. They both hung their heads. Both
of them felt certain that eye wasn&rsquo;t at all a peaceful eye.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo; said Josephine.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Pinner,&rdquo; said Mr. Farolles gratefully. He folded
his coat-tails and began to lower himself into father&rsquo;s arm-chair, but
just as he touched it he almost sprang up and slid into the next chair instead.
</p>

<p>
He coughed. Josephine clasped her hands; Constantia looked vague.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want you to feel, Miss Pinner,&rdquo; said Mr. Farolles, &ldquo;and
you, Miss Constantia, that I&rsquo;m trying to be helpful. I want to be helpful
to you both, if you will let me. These are the times,&rdquo; said Mr Farolles,
very simply and earnestly, &ldquo;when God means us to be helpful to one
another.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you very much, Mr. Farolles,&rdquo; said Josephine and Constantia.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Mr. Farolles gently. He drew his kid gloves
through his fingers and leaned forward. &ldquo;And if either of you would like
a little Communion, either or both of you, here <i>and</i> now, you have only
to tell me. A little Communion is often very help&mdash;a great comfort,&rdquo;
he added tenderly.
</p>

<p>
But the idea of a little Communion terrified them. What! In the drawing-room by
themselves&mdash;with no&mdash;no altar or anything! The piano would be much
too high, thought Constantia, and Mr. Farolles could not possibly lean over it
with the chalice. And Kate would be sure to come bursting in and interrupt
them, thought Josephine. And supposing the bell rang in the middle? It might be
somebody important&mdash;about their mourning. Would they get up reverently and
go out, or would they have to wait... in torture?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps you will send round a note by your good Kate if you would care
for it later,&rdquo; said Mr. Farolles.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, thank you very much!&rdquo; they both said.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Farolles got up and took his black straw hat from the round table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And about the funeral,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;I may arrange
that&mdash;as your dear father&rsquo;s old friend and yours, Miss
Pinner&mdash;and Miss Constantia?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Josephine and Constantia got up too.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should like it to be quite simple,&rdquo; said Josephine firmly,
&ldquo;and not too expensive. At the same time, I should like&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A good one that will last,&rdquo; thought dreamy Constantia, as if
Josephine were buying a nightgown. But, of course, Josephine didn&rsquo;t say
that. &ldquo;One suitable to our father&rsquo;s position.&rdquo; She was very
nervous.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run round to our good friend Mr. Knight,&rdquo; said Mr.
Farolles soothingly. &ldquo;I will ask him to come and see you. I am sure you
will find him very helpful indeed.&rdquo;
</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>
Well, at any rate, all that part of it was over, though neither of them could
possibly believe that father was never coming back. Josephine had had a moment
of absolute terror at the cemetery, while the coffin was lowered, to think that
she and Constantia had done this thing without asking his permission. What
would father say when he found out? For he was bound to find out sooner or
later. He always did. &ldquo;Buried. You two girls had me <i>buried</i>!&rdquo;
She heard his stick thumping. Oh, what would they say? What possible excuse
could they make? It sounded such an appallingly heartless thing to do. Such a
wicked advantage to take of a person because he happened to be helpless at the
moment. The other people seemed to treat it all as a matter of course. They
were strangers; they couldn&rsquo;t be expected to understand that father was
the very last person for such a thing to happen to. No, the entire blame for it
all would fall on her and Constantia. And the expense, she thought, stepping
into the tight-buttoned cab. When she had to show him the bills. What would he
say then?
</p>

<p>
She heard him absolutely roaring. &ldquo;And do you expect me to pay for this
gimcrack excursion of yours?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; groaned poor Josephine aloud, &ldquo;we shouldn&rsquo;t have
done it, Con!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Constantia, pale as a lemon in all that blackness, said in a frightened
whisper, &ldquo;Done what, Jug?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let them bu-bury father like that,&rdquo; said Josephine, breaking down
and crying into her new, queer-smelling mourning handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what else could we have done?&rdquo; asked Constantia wonderingly.
&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t have kept him, Jug&mdash;we couldn&rsquo;t have kept
him unburied. At any rate, not in a flat that size.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Josephine blew her nose; the cab was dreadfully stuffy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said forlornly. &ldquo;It is all so
dreadful. I feel we ought to have tried to, just for a time at least. To make
perfectly sure. One thing&rsquo;s certain&rdquo;&mdash;and her tears sprang out
again&mdash;&ldquo;father will never forgive us for this&mdash;never!&rdquo;
</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>
Father would never forgive them. That was what they felt more than ever when,
two mornings later, they went into his room to go through his things. They had
discussed it quite calmly. It was even down on Josephine&rsquo;s list of things
to be done. &ldquo;<i>Go through father&rsquo;s things and settle about
them.</i>&rdquo; But that was a very different matter from saying after
breakfast:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, are you ready, Con?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Jug&mdash;when you are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I think we&rsquo;d better get it over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was dark in the hall. It had been a rule for years never to disturb father
in the morning, whatever happened. And now they were going to open the door
without knocking even.... Constantia&rsquo;s eyes were enormous at the idea;
Josephine felt weak in the knees.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&mdash;you go first,&rdquo; she gasped, pushing Constantia.
</p>

<p>
But Constantia said, as she always had said on those occasions, &ldquo;No, Jug,
that&rsquo;s not fair. You&rsquo;re the eldest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Josephine was just going to say&mdash;what at other times she wouldn&rsquo;t
have owned to for the world&mdash;what she kept for her very last weapon,
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re the tallest,&rdquo; when they noticed that the kitchen
door was open, and there stood Kate....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very stiff,&rdquo; said Josephine, grasping the doorhandle and doing her
best to turn it. As if anything ever deceived Kate!
</p>

<p>
It couldn&rsquo;t be helped. That girl was.... Then the door was shut behind
them, but&mdash;but they weren&rsquo;t in father&rsquo;s room at all. They
might have suddenly walked through the wall by mistake into a different flat
altogether. Was the door just behind them? They were too frightened to look.
Josephine knew that if it was it was holding itself tight shut; Constantia felt
that, like the doors in dreams, it hadn&rsquo;t any handle at all. It was the
coldness which made it so awful. Or the whiteness&mdash;which? Everything was
covered. The blinds were down, a cloth hung over the mirror, a sheet hid the
bed; a huge fan of white paper filled the fireplace. Constantia timidly put out
her hand; she almost expected a snowflake to fall. Josephine felt a queer
tingling in her nose, as if her nose was freezing. Then a cab klop-klopped over
the cobbles below, and the quiet seemed to shake into little pieces.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had better pull up a blind,&rdquo; said Josephine bravely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it might be a good idea,&rdquo; whispered Constantia.
</p>

<p>
They only gave the blind a touch, but it flew up and the cord flew after,
rolling round the blind-stick, and the little tassel tapped as if trying to get
free. That was too much for Constantia.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think we might put it off
for another day?&rdquo; she whispered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; snapped Josephine, feeling, as usual, much better now that
she knew for certain that Constantia was terrified. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to be
done. But I do wish you wouldn&rsquo;t whisper, Con.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I was whispering,&rdquo; whispered Constantia.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And why do you keep staring at the bed?&rdquo; said Josephine, raising
her voice almost defiantly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing <i>on</i> the
bed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Jug, don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; said poor Connie. &ldquo;At any
rate, not so loudly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Josephine felt herself that she had gone too far. She took a wide swerve over
to the chest of drawers, put out her hand, but quickly drew it back again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Connie!&rdquo; she gasped, and she wheeled round and leaned with her
back against the chest of drawers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Jug&mdash;what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Josephine could only glare. She had the most extraordinary feeling that she had
just escaped something simply awful. But how could she explain to Constantia
that father was in the chest of drawers? He was in the top drawer with his
handkerchiefs and neckties, or in the next with his shirts and pyjamas, or in
the lowest of all with his suits. He was watching there, hidden away&mdash;just
behind the door-handle&mdash;ready to spring.
</p>

<p>
She pulled a funny old-fashioned face at Constantia, just as she used to in the
old days when she was going to cry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t open,&rdquo; she nearly wailed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t, Jug,&rdquo; whispered Constantia earnestly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s much better not to. Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s open anything. At
any rate, not for a long time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But&mdash;but it seems so weak,&rdquo; said Josephine, breaking down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why not be weak for once, Jug?&rdquo; argued Constantia, whispering
quite fiercely. &ldquo;If it is weak.&rdquo; And her pale stare flew from the
locked writing-table&mdash;so safe&mdash;to the huge glittering wardrobe, and
she began to breathe in a queer, panting away. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we be
weak for once in our lives, Jug? It&rsquo;s quite excusable. Let&rsquo;s be
weak&mdash;be weak, Jug. It&rsquo;s much nicer to be weak than to be
strong.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And then she did one of those amazingly bold things that she&rsquo;d done about
twice before in their lives: she marched over to the wardrobe, turned the key,
and took it out of the lock. Took it out of the lock and held it up to
Josephine, showing Josephine by her extraordinary smile that she knew what
she&rsquo;d done&mdash;she&rsquo;d risked deliberately father being in there
among his overcoats.
</p>

<p>
If the huge wardrobe had lurched forward, had crashed down on Constantia,
Josephine wouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised. On the contrary, she would have
thought it the only suitable thing to happen. But nothing happened. Only the
room seemed quieter than ever, and the bigger flakes of cold air fell on
Josephine&rsquo;s shoulders and knees. She began to shiver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, Jug,&rdquo; said Constantia, still with that awful callous smile,
and Josephine followed just as she had that last time, when Constantia had
pushed Benny into the round pond.
</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>
But the strain told on them when they were back in the dining-room. They sat
down, very shaky, and looked at each other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel I can settle to anything,&rdquo; said Josephine,
&ldquo;until I&rsquo;ve had something. Do you think we could ask Kate for two
cups of hot water?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t see why we shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Constantia
carefully. She was quite normal again. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t ring. I&rsquo;ll go
to the kitchen door and ask her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; said Josephine, sinking down into a chair. &ldquo;Tell
her, just two cups, Con, nothing else&mdash;on a tray.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She needn&rsquo;t even put the jug on, need she?&rdquo; said Constantia,
as though Kate might very well complain if the jug had been there.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, certainly not! The jug&rsquo;s not at all necessary. She can pour
it direct out of the kettle,&rdquo; cried Josephine, feeling that would be a
labour-saving indeed.
</p>

<p>
Their cold lips quivered at the greenish brims. Josephine curved her small red
hands round the cup; Constantia sat up and blew on the wavy steam, making it
flutter from one side to the other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Speaking of Benny,&rdquo; said Josephine.
</p>

<p>
And though Benny hadn&rsquo;t been mentioned Constantia immediately looked as
though he had.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll expect us to send him something of father&rsquo;s, of
course. But it&rsquo;s so difficult to know what to send to Ceylon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean things get unstuck so on the voyage,&rdquo; murmured
Constantia.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, lost,&rdquo; said Josephine sharply. &ldquo;You know there&rsquo;s
no post. Only runners.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Both paused to watch a black man in white linen drawers running through the
pale fields for dear life, with a large brown-paper parcel in his hands.
Josephine&rsquo;s black man was tiny; he scurried along glistening like an ant.
But there was something blind and tireless about Constantia&rsquo;s tall, thin
fellow, which made him, she decided, a very unpleasant person indeed.... On the
veranda, dressed all in white and wearing a cork helmet, stood Benny. His right
hand shook up and down, as father&rsquo;s did when he was impatient. And behind
him, not in the least interested, sat Hilda, the unknown sister-in-law. She
swung in a cane rocker and flicked over the leaves of the <i>Tatler</i>.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think his watch would be the most suitable present,&rdquo; said
Josephine.
</p>

<p>
Constantia looked up; she seemed surprised.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, would you trust a gold watch to a native?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But of course, I&rsquo;d disguise it,&rdquo; said Josephine. &ldquo;No
one would know it was a watch.&rdquo; She liked the idea of having to make a
parcel such a curious shape that no one could possibly guess what it was. She
even thought for a moment of hiding the watch in a narrow cardboard corset-box
that she&rsquo;d kept by her for a long time, waiting for it to come in for
something. It was such beautiful, firm cardboard. But, no, it wouldn&rsquo;t be
appropriate for this occasion. It had lettering on it: <i>Medium
Women&rsquo;s</i> 28. <i>Extra Firm Busks.</i> It would be almost too much of a
surprise for Benny to open that and find father&rsquo;s watch inside.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And of course it isn&rsquo;t as though it would be going&mdash;ticking,
I mean,&rdquo; said Constantia, who was still thinking of the native love of
jewellery. &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;it would be very strange
if after all that time it was.&rdquo;
</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>
Josephine made no reply. She had flown off on one of her tangents. She had
suddenly thought of Cyril. Wasn&rsquo;t it more usual for the only grandson to
have the watch? And then dear Cyril was so appreciative, and a gold watch meant
so much to a young man. Benny, in all probability, had quite got out of the
habit of watches; men so seldom wore waistcoats in those hot climates. Whereas
Cyril in London wore them from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end. And it
would be so nice for her and Constantia, when he came to tea, to know it was
there. &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve got on grandfather&rsquo;s watch,
Cyril.&rdquo; It would be somehow so satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
Dear boy! What a blow his sweet, sympathetic little note had been! Of course
they quite understood; but it was most unfortunate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would have been such a point, having him,&rdquo; said Josephine.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And he would have enjoyed it so,&rdquo; said Constantia, not thinking
what she was saying.
</p>

<p>
However, as soon as he got back he was coming to tea with his aunties. Cyril to
tea was one of their rare treats.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, Cyril, you mustn&rsquo;t be frightened of our cakes. Your Auntie
Con and I bought them at Buszard&rsquo;s this morning. We know what a
man&rsquo;s appetite is. So don&rsquo;t be ashamed of making a good tea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Josephine cut recklessly into the rich dark cake that stood for her winter
gloves or the soling and heeling of Constantia&rsquo;s only respectable shoes.
But Cyril was most unmanlike in appetite.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, Aunt Josephine, I simply can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve only just had
lunch, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Cyril, that can&rsquo;t be true! It&rsquo;s after four,&rdquo; cried
Josephine. Constantia sat with her knife poised over the chocolate-roll.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is, all the same,&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;I had to meet a man at
Victoria, and he kept me hanging about till... there was only time to get lunch
and to come on here. And he gave me&mdash;phew&rdquo;&mdash;Cyril put his hand
to his forehead&mdash;&ldquo;a terrific blow-out,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
It was disappointing&mdash;to-day of all days. But still he couldn&rsquo;t be
expected to know.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll have a meringue, won&rsquo;t you, Cyril?&rdquo; said
Aunt Josephine. &ldquo;These meringues were bought specially for you. Your dear
father was so fond of them. We were sure you are, too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <i>am</i>, Aunt Josephine,&rdquo; cried Cyril ardently. &ldquo;Do you
mind if I take half to begin with?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not at all, dear boy; but we mustn&rsquo;t let you off with that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is your dear father still so fond of meringues?&rdquo; asked Auntie Con
gently. She winced faintly as she broke through the shell of hers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t quite know, Auntie Con,&rdquo; said Cyril breezily.
</p>

<p>
At that they both looked up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; almost snapped Josephine. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
know a thing like that about your own father, Cyril?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said Auntie Con softly.
</p>

<p>
Cyril tried to laugh it off. &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
such a long time since&mdash;&rdquo; He faltered. He stopped. Their faces were
too much for him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Even <i>so</i>,&rdquo; said Josephine.
</p>

<p>
And Auntie Con looked.
</p>

<p>
Cyril put down his teacup. &ldquo;Wait a bit,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Wait a
bit, Aunt Josephine. What am I thinking of?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked up. They were beginning to brighten. Cyril slapped his knee.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was meringues. How could I have
forgotten? Yes, Aunt Josephine, you&rsquo;re perfectly right. Father&rsquo;s
most frightfully keen on meringues.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They didn&rsquo;t only beam. Aunt Josephine went scarlet with pleasure; Auntie
Con gave a deep, deep sigh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And now, Cyril, you must come and see father,&rdquo; said Josephine.
&ldquo;He knows you were coming to-day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said Cyril, very firmly and heartily. He got up from his
chair; suddenly he glanced at the clock.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, Auntie Con, isn&rsquo;t your clock a bit slow? I&rsquo;ve got to
meet a man at&mdash;at Paddington just after five. I&rsquo;m afraid I
shan&rsquo;t be able to stay very long with grandfather.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he won&rsquo;t expect you to stay <i>very</i> long!&rdquo; said Aunt
Josephine.
</p>

<p>
Constantia was still gazing at the clock. She couldn&rsquo;t make up her mind
if it was fast or slow. It was one or the other, she felt almost certain of
that. At any rate, it had been.
</p>

<p>
Cyril still lingered. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming along, Auntie Con?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Josephine, &ldquo;we shall all go. Come on,
Con.&rdquo;
</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>
They knocked at the door, and Cyril followed his aunts into grandfather&rsquo;s
hot, sweetish room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Grandfather Pinner. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hang about.
What is it? What&rsquo;ve you been up to?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was sitting in front of a roaring fire, clasping his stick. He had a thick
rug over his knees. On his lap there lay a beautiful pale yellow silk
handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Cyril, father,&rdquo; said Josephine shyly. And she took
Cyril&rsquo;s hand and led him forward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good afternoon, grandfather,&rdquo; said Cyril, trying to take his hand
out of Aunt Josephine&rsquo;s. Grandfather Pinner shot his eyes at Cyril in the
way he was famous for. Where was Auntie Con? She stood on the other side of
Aunt Josephine; her long arms hung down in front of her; her hands were
clasped. She never took her eyes off grandfather.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Grandfather Pinner, beginning to thump, &ldquo;what
have you got to tell me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
What had he, what had he got to tell him? Cyril felt himself smiling like a
perfect imbecile. The room was stifling, too.
</p>

<p>
But Aunt Josephine came to his rescue. She cried brightly, &ldquo;Cyril says
his father is still very fond of meringues, father dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Grandfather Pinner, curving his hand like a purple
meringue-shell over one ear.
</p>

<p>
Josephine repeated, &ldquo;Cyril says his father is still very fond of
meringues.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t hear,&rdquo; said old Colonel Pinner. And he waved Josephine
away with his stick, then pointed with his stick to Cyril. &ldquo;Tell me what
she&rsquo;s trying to say,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
(My God!) &ldquo;Must I?&rdquo; said Cyril, blushing and staring at Aunt
Josephine.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do, dear,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;It will please him so much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come on, out with it!&rdquo; cried Colonel Pinner testily, beginning to
thump again.
</p>

<p>
And Cyril leaned forward and yelled, &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s still very fond of
meringues.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At that Grandfather Pinner jumped as though he had been shot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shout!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with
the boy? <i>Meringues!</i> What about &rsquo;em?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Josephine, must we go on?&rdquo; groaned Cyril desperately.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite all right, dear boy,&rdquo; said Aunt Josephine, as
though he and she were at the dentist&rsquo;s together. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
understand in a minute.&rdquo; And she whispered to Cyril, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
getting a bit deaf, you know.&rdquo; Then she leaned forward and really bawled
at Grandfather Pinner, &ldquo;Cyril only wanted to tell you, father dear, that
<i>his</i> father is still very fond of meringues.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Colonel Pinner heard that time, heard and brooded, looking Cyril up and down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What an esstrordinary thing!&rdquo; said old Grandfather Pinner.
&ldquo;What an esstrordinary thing to come all this way here to tell me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Cyril felt it <i>was</i>.<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I shall send Cyril the watch,&rdquo; said Josephine.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That would be very nice,&rdquo; said Constantia. &ldquo;I seem to
remember last time he came there was some little trouble about the time.&rdquo;
</p>

<h3>X</h3>

<p>
They were interrupted by Kate bursting through the door in her usual fashion,
as though she had discovered some secret panel in the wall.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fried or boiled?&rdquo; asked the bold voice.
</p>

<p>
Fried or boiled? Josephine and Constantia were quite bewildered for the moment.
They could hardly take it in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fried or boiled what, Kate?&rdquo; asked Josephine, trying to begin to
concentrate.
</p>

<p>
Kate gave a loud sniff. &ldquo;Fish.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t you say so immediately?&rdquo; Josephine
reproached her gently. &ldquo;How could you expect us to understand, Kate?
There are a great many things in this world you know, which are fried or
boiled.&rdquo; And after such a display of courage she said quite brightly to
Constantia, &ldquo;Which do you prefer, Con?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think it might be nice to have it fried,&rdquo; said Constantia.
&ldquo;On the other hand, of course, boiled fish is very nice. I think I prefer
both equally well.... Unless you.... In that case&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall fry it,&rdquo; said Kate, and she bounced back, leaving their
door open and slamming the door of her kitchen.
</p>

<p>
Josephine gazed at Constantia; she raised her pale eyebrows until they rippled
away into her pale hair. She got up. She said in a very lofty, imposing way,
&ldquo;Do you mind following me into the drawing-room, Constantia? I&rsquo;ve
got something of great importance to discuss with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For it was always to the drawing-room they retired when they wanted to talk
over Kate.
</p>

<p>
Josephine closed the door meaningly. &ldquo;Sit down, Constantia,&rdquo; she
said, still very grand. She might have been receiving Constantia for the first
time. And Con looked round vaguely for a chair, as though she felt indeed quite
a stranger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now the question is,&rdquo; said Josephine, bending forward,
&ldquo;whether we shall keep her or not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is the question,&rdquo; agreed Constantia.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And this time,&rdquo; said Josephine firmly, &ldquo;we must come to a
definite decision.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Constantia looked for a moment as though she might begin going over all the
other times, but she pulled herself together and said, &ldquo;Yes, Jug.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, Con,&rdquo; explained Josephine, &ldquo;everything is so
changed now.&rdquo; Constantia looked up quickly. &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; went on
Josephine, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not dependent on Kate as we were.&rdquo; And she
blushed faintly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not father to cook for.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is perfectly true,&rdquo; agreed Constantia. &ldquo;Father
certainly doesn&rsquo;t want any cooking now, whatever else&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Josephine broke in sharply, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not sleepy, are you,
Con?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sleepy, Jug?&rdquo; Constantia was wide-eyed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, concentrate more,&rdquo; said Josephine sharply, and she returned
to the subject. &ldquo;What it comes to is, if we did&rdquo;&mdash;and this she
barely breathed, glancing at the door&mdash;&ldquo;give Kate
notice&rdquo;&mdash;she raised her voice again&mdash;&ldquo;we could manage our
own food.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; cried Constantia. She couldn&rsquo;t help smiling. The
idea was so exciting. She clasped her hands. &ldquo;What should we live on,
Jug?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, eggs in various forms!&rdquo; said Jug, lofty again. &ldquo;And,
besides, there are all the cooked foods.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve always heard,&rdquo; said Constantia, &ldquo;they are
considered so very expensive.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not if one buys them in moderation,&rdquo; said Josephine. But she tore
herself away from this fascinating bypath and dragged Constantia after her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What we&rsquo;ve got to decide now, however, is whether we really do
trust Kate or not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Constantia leaned back. Her flat little laugh flew from her lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it curious, Jug,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that just on this
one subject I&rsquo;ve never been able to quite make up my mind?&rdquo;
</p>

<h3>XI</h3>

<p>
She never had. The whole difficulty was to prove anything. How did one prove
things, how could one? Suppose Kate had stood in front of her and deliberately
made a face. Mightn&rsquo;t she very well have been in pain? Wasn&rsquo;t it
impossible, at any rate, to ask Kate if she was making a face at her? If Kate
answered &ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;and, of course, she would say
&ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;what a position! How undignified! Then again Constantia
suspected, she was almost certain that Kate went to her chest of drawers when
she and Josephine were out, not to take things but to spy. Many times she had
come back to find her amethyst cross in the most unlikely places, under her
lace ties or on top of her evening Bertha. More than once she had laid a trap
for Kate. She had arranged things in a special order and then called Josephine
to witness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, Jug?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite, Con.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now we shall be able to tell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But, oh dear, when she did go to look, she was as far off from a proof as ever!
If anything was displaced, it might so very well have happened as she closed
the drawer; a jolt might have done it so easily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You come, Jug, and decide. I really can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s too
difficult.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But after a pause and a long glare Josephine would sigh, &ldquo;Now
you&rsquo;ve put the doubt into my mind, Con, I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t tell
myself.&rdquo;<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t postpone it again,&rdquo; said Josephine. &ldquo;If
we postpone it this time&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<h3>XII</h3>

<p>
But at that moment in the street below a barrel-organ struck up. Josephine and
Constantia sprang to their feet together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Run, Con,&rdquo; said Josephine. &ldquo;Run quickly. There&rsquo;s
sixpence on the&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then they remembered. It didn&rsquo;t matter. They would never have to stop the
organ-grinder again. Never again would she and Constantia be told to make that
monkey take his noise somewhere else. Never would sound that loud, strange
bellow when father thought they were not hurrying enough. The organ-grinder
might play there all day and the stick would not thump.
</p>

<p class="poem">
It never will thump again,<br />
It never will thump again,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
played the barrel-organ.
</p>

<p>
What was Constantia thinking? She had such a strange smile; she looked
different. She couldn&rsquo;t be going to cry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jug, Jug,&rdquo; said Constantia softly, pressing her hands together.
&ldquo;Do you know what day it is? It&rsquo;s Saturday. It&rsquo;s a week
to-day, a whole week.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="poem">
A week since father died,<br />
A week since father died,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
cried the barrel-organ. And Josephine, too, forgot to be practical and
sensible; she smiled faintly, strangely. On the Indian carpet there fell a
square of sunlight, pale red; it came and went and came&mdash;and stayed,
deepened&mdash;until it shone almost golden.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The sun&rsquo;s out,&rdquo; said Josephine, as though it really
mattered.
</p>

<p>
A perfect fountain of bubbling notes shook from the barrel-organ, round, bright
notes, carelessly scattered.
</p>

<p>
Constantia lifted her big, cold hands as if to catch them, and then her hands
fell again. She walked over to the mantelpiece to her favourite Buddha. And the
stone and gilt image, whose smile always gave her such a queer feeling, almost
a pain and yet a pleasant pain, seemed to-day to be more than smiling. He knew
something; he had a secret. &ldquo;I know something that you don&rsquo;t
know,&rdquo; said her Buddha. Oh, what was it, what could it be? And yet she
had always felt there was... something.
</p>

<p>
The sunlight pressed through the windows, thieved its way in, flashed its light
over the furniture and the photographs. Josephine watched it. When it came to
mother&rsquo;s photograph, the enlargement over the piano, it lingered as
though puzzled to find so little remained of mother, except the earrings shaped
like tiny pagodas and a black feather boa. Why did the photographs of dead
people always fade so? wondered Josephine. As soon as a person was dead their
photograph died too. But, of course, this one of mother was very old. It was
thirty-five years old. Josephine remembered standing on a chair and pointing
out that feather boa to Constantia and telling her that it was a snake that had
killed their mother in Ceylon.... Would everything have been different if
mother hadn&rsquo;t died? She didn&rsquo;t see why. Aunt Florence had lived
with them until they had left school, and they had moved three times and had
their yearly holiday and... and there&rsquo;d been changes of servants, of
course.
</p>

<p>
Some little sparrows, young sparrows they sounded, chirped on the window-ledge.
<i>Yeep&mdash;eyeep&mdash;yeep.</i> But Josephine felt they were not sparrows,
not on the window-ledge. It was inside her, that queer little crying noise.
<i>Yeep&mdash;eyeep&mdash;yeep.</i> Ah, what was it crying, so weak and forlorn?
</p>

<p>
If mother had lived, might they have married? But there had been nobody for
them to marry. There had been father&rsquo;s Anglo-Indian friends before he
quarrelled with them. But after that she and Constantia never met a single man
except clergymen. How did one meet men? Or even if they&rsquo;d met them, how
could they have got to know men well enough to be more than strangers? One read
of people having adventures, being followed, and so on. But nobody had ever
followed Constantia and her. Oh yes, there had been one year at Eastbourne a
mysterious man at their boarding-house who had put a note on the jug of hot
water outside their bedroom door! But by the time Connie had found it the steam
had made the writing too faint to read; they couldn&rsquo;t even make out to
which of them it was addressed. And he had left next day. And that was all. The
rest had been looking after father, and at the same time keeping out of
father&rsquo;s way. But now? But now? The thieving sun touched Josephine
gently. She lifted her face. She was drawn over to the window by gentle
beams....
</p>

<p>
Until the barrel-organ stopped playing Constantia stayed before the Buddha,
wondering, but not as usual, not vaguely. This time her wonder was like
longing. She remembered the times she had come in here, crept out of bed in her
nightgown when the moon was full, and lain on the floor with her arms
outstretched, as though she was crucified. Why? The big, pale moon had made her
do it. The horrible dancing figures on the carved screen had leered at her and
she hadn&rsquo;t minded. She remembered too how, whenever they were at the
seaside, she had gone off by herself and got as close to the sea as she could,
and sung something, something she had made up, while she gazed all over that
restless water. There had been this other life, running out, bringing things
home in bags, getting things on approval, discussing them with Jug, and taking
them back to get more things on approval, and arranging father&rsquo;s trays
and trying not to annoy father. But it all seemed to have happened in a kind of
tunnel. It wasn&rsquo;t real. It was only when she came out of the tunnel into
the moonlight or by the sea or into a thunderstorm that she really felt
herself. What did it mean? What was it she was always wanting? What did it all
lead to? Now? Now?
</p>

<p>
She turned away from the Buddha with one of her vague gestures. She went over
to where Josephine was standing. She wanted to say something to Josephine,
something frightfully important, about&mdash;about the future and what....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think perhaps&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
</p>

<p>
But Josephine interrupted her. &ldquo;I was wondering if now&mdash;&rdquo; she
murmured. They stopped; they waited for each other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on, Con,&rdquo; said Josephine.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, Jug; after you,&rdquo; said Constantia.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, say what you were going to say. You began,&rdquo; said Josephine.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I... I&rsquo;d rather hear what you were going to say first,&rdquo; said
Constantia.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd, Con.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really, Jug.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Connie!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, <i>Jug</i>!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A pause. Then Constantia said faintly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say what I was
going to say, Jug, because I&rsquo;ve forgotten what it was... that I was going
to say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Josephine was silent for a moment. She stared at a big cloud where the sun had
been. Then she replied shortly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgotten too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><a name="chap04"></a></p> <h2>Mr. and Mrs. Dove</h2>

<p>
Of course he knew&mdash;no man better&mdash;that he hadn&rsquo;t a ghost of a
chance, he hadn&rsquo;t an earthly. The very idea of such a thing was
preposterous. So preposterous that he&rsquo;d perfectly understand it if her
father&mdash;well, whatever her father chose to do he&rsquo;d perfectly
understand. In fact, nothing short of desperation, nothing short of the fact
that this was positively his last day in England for God knows how long, would
have screwed him up to it. And even now.... He chose a tie out of the chest of
drawers, a blue and cream check tie, and sat on the side of his bed. Supposing
she replied, &ldquo;What impertinence!&rdquo; would he be surprised? Not in the
least, he decided, turning up his soft collar and turning it down over the tie.
He expected her to say something like that. He didn&rsquo;t see, if he looked
at the affair dead soberly, what else she could say.
</p>

<p>
Here he was! And nervously he tied a bow in front of the mirror, jammed his
hair down with both hands, pulled out the flaps of his jacket pockets. Making
between £500 and £600 a year on a fruit farm in&mdash;of all
places&mdash;Rhodesia. No capital. Not a penny coming to him. No chance of his
income increasing for at least four years. As for looks and all that sort of
thing, he was completely out of the running. He couldn&rsquo;t even boast of
top-hole health, for the East Africa business had knocked him out so thoroughly
that he&rsquo;d had to take six months&rsquo; leave. He was still fearfully
pale&mdash;worse even than usual this afternoon, he thought, bending forward
and peering into the mirror. Good heavens! What had happened? His hair looked
almost bright green. Dash it all, he hadn&rsquo;t green hair at all events.
That was a bit too steep. And then the green light trembled in the glass; it
was the shadow from the tree outside. Reggie turned away, took out his
cigarette case, but remembering how the mater hated him to smoke in his
bedroom, put it back again and drifted over to the chest of drawers. No, he was
dashed if he could think of one blessed thing in his favour, while she....
Ah!... He stopped dead, folded his arms, and leaned hard against the chest of
drawers.
</p>

<p>
And in spite of her position, her father&rsquo;s wealth, the fact that she was
an only child and far and away the most popular girl in the neighbourhood; in
spite of her beauty and her cleverness&mdash;cleverness!&mdash;it was a great
deal more than that, there was really nothing she couldn&rsquo;t do; he fully
believed, had it been necessary, she would have been a genius at
anything&mdash;in spite of the fact that her parents adored her, and she them,
and they&rsquo;d as soon let her go all that way as.... In spite of every
single thing you could think of, so terrific was his love that he
couldn&rsquo;t help hoping. Well, was it hope? Or was this queer, timid longing
to have the chance of looking after her, of making it his job to see that she
had everything she wanted, and that nothing came near her that wasn&rsquo;t
perfect&mdash;just love? How he loved her! He squeezed hard against the chest
of drawers and murmured to it, &ldquo;I love her, I love her!&rdquo; And just
for the moment he was with her on the way to Umtali. It was night. She sat in a
corner asleep. Her soft chin was tucked into her soft collar, her gold-brown
lashes lay on her cheeks. He doted on her delicate little nose, her perfect
lips, her ear like a baby&rsquo;s, and the gold-brown curl that half covered
it. They were passing through the jungle. It was warm and dark and far away.
Then she woke up and said, &ldquo;Have I been asleep?&rdquo; and he answered,
&ldquo;Yes. Are you all right? Here, let me&mdash;&rdquo; And he leaned forward
to.... He bent over her. This was such bliss that he could dream no further.
But it gave him the courage to bound downstairs, to snatch his straw hat from
the hall, and to say as he closed the front door, &ldquo;Well, I can only try
my luck, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But his luck gave him a nasty jar, to say the least, almost immediately.
Promenading up and down the garden path with Chinny and Biddy, the ancient
Pekes, was the mater. Of course Reginald was fond of the mater and all that.
She&mdash;she meant well, she had no end of grit, and so on. But there was no
denying it, she was rather a grim parent. And there had been moments, many of
them, in Reggie&rsquo;s life, before Uncle Alick died and left him the fruit
farm, when he was convinced that to be a widow&rsquo;s only son was about the
worst punishment a chap could have. And what made it rougher than ever was that
she was positively all that he had. She wasn&rsquo;t only a combined parent, as
it were, but she had quarrelled with all her own and the governor&rsquo;s
relations before Reggie had won his first trouser pockets. So that whenever
Reggie was homesick out there, sitting on his dark veranda by starlight, while
the gramophone cried, &ldquo;Dear, what is Life but Love?&rdquo; his only
vision was of the mater, tall and stout, rustling down the garden path, with
Chinny and Biddy at her heels....
</p>

<p>
The mater, with her scissors outspread to snap the head of a dead something or
other, stopped at the sight of Reggie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are not going out, Reginald?&rdquo; she asked, seeing that he was.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back for tea, mater,&rdquo; said Reggie weakly, plunging
his hands into his jacket pockets.
</p>

<p>
Snip. Off came a head. Reggie almost jumped.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should have thought you could have spared your mother your last
afternoon,&rdquo; said she.
</p>

<p>
Silence. The Pekes stared. They understood every word of the mater&rsquo;s.
Biddy lay down with her tongue poked out; she was so fat and glossy she looked
like a lump of half-melted toffee. But Chinny&rsquo;s porcelain eyes gloomed at
Reginald, and he sniffed faintly, as though the whole world were one unpleasant
smell. Snip, went the scissors again. Poor little beggars; they were getting
it!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And where are you going, if your mother may ask?&rdquo; asked the mater.
</p>

<p>
It was over at last, but Reggie did not slow down until he was out of sight of
the house and half-way to Colonel Proctor&rsquo;s. Then only he noticed what a
top-hole afternoon it was. It had been raining all the morning, late summer
rain, warm, heavy, quick, and now the sky was clear, except for a long tail of
little clouds, like duckings, sailing over the forest. There was just enough
wind to shake the last drops off the trees; one warm star splashed on his hand.
Ping!&mdash;another drummed on his hat. The empty road gleamed, the hedges
smelled of briar, and how big and bright the hollyhocks glowed in the cottage
gardens. And here was Colonel Proctor&rsquo;s&mdash;here it was already. His
hand was on the gate, his elbow jogged the syringa bushes, and petals and
pollen scattered over his coat sleeve. But wait a bit. This was too quick
altogether. He&rsquo;d meant to think the whole thing out again. Here, steady.
But he was walking up the path, with the huge rose bushes on either side. It
can&rsquo;t be done like this. But his hand had grasped the bell, given it a
pull, and started it pealing wildly, as if he&rsquo;d come to say the house was
on fire. The housemaid must have been in the hall, too, for the front door
flashed open, and Reggie was shut in the empty drawing-room before that
confounded bell had stopped ringing. Strangely enough, when it did, the big
room, shadowy, with some one&rsquo;s parasol lying on top of the grand piano,
bucked him up&mdash;or rather, excited him. It was so quiet, and yet in one
moment the door would open, and his fate be decided. The feeling was not unlike
that of being at the dentist&rsquo;s; he was almost reckless. But at the same
time, to his immense surprise, Reggie heard himself saying, &ldquo;Lord, Thou
knowest, Thou hast not done <i>much</i> for me....&rdquo; That pulled him up;
that made him realize again how dead serious it was. Too late. The door handle
turned. Anne came in, crossed the shadowy space between them, gave him her
hand, and said, in her small, soft voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, father is
out. And mother is having a day in town, hat-hunting. There&rsquo;s only me to
entertain you, Reggie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Reggie gasped, pressed his own hat to his jacket buttons, and stammered out,
&ldquo;As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;ve only come... to say good-bye.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Anne softly&mdash;she stepped back from him and her
grey eyes danced&mdash;&ldquo;what a <i>very</i> short visit!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then, watching him, her chin tilted, she laughed outright, a long, soft peal,
and walked away from him over to the piano, and leaned against it, playing with
the tassel of the parasol.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to be laughing like this. I
don&rsquo;t know why I do. It&rsquo;s just a bad ha-habit.&rdquo; And suddenly
she stamped her grey shoe, and took a pocket-handkerchief out of her white
woolly jacket. &ldquo;I really must conquer it, it&rsquo;s too absurd,&rdquo;
said she.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens, Anne,&rdquo; cried Reggie, &ldquo;I love to hear you
laughing! I can&rsquo;t imagine anything more&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But the truth was, and they both knew it, she wasn&rsquo;t always laughing; it
wasn&rsquo;t really a habit. Only ever since the day they&rsquo;d met, ever
since that very first moment, for some strange reason that Reggie wished to God
he understood, Anne had laughed at him. Why? It didn&rsquo;t matter where they
were or what they were talking about. They might begin by being as serious as
possible, dead serious&mdash;at any rate, as far as he was concerned&mdash;but
then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, Anne would glance at him, and a
little quick quiver passed over her face. Her lips parted, her eyes danced, and
she began laughing.
</p>

<p>
Another queer thing about it was, Reggie had an idea she didn&rsquo;t herself
know why she laughed. He had seen her turn away, frown, suck in her cheeks,
press her hands together. But it was no use. The long, soft peal sounded, even
while she cried, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m laughing.&rdquo; It
was a mystery....
</p>

<p>
Now she tucked the handkerchief away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do sit down,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;And smoke, won&rsquo;t you? There
are cigarettes in that little box beside you. I&rsquo;ll have one too.&rdquo;
He lighted a match for her, and as she bent forward he saw the tiny flame glow
in the pearl ring she wore. &ldquo;It is to-morrow that you&rsquo;re going,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Anne.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, to-morrow as ever was,&rdquo; said Reggie, and he blew a little fan
of smoke. Why on earth was he so nervous? Nervous wasn&rsquo;t the word for it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s frightfully hard to believe,&rdquo; he
added.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Anne softly, and she leaned
forward and rolled the point of her cigarette round the green ash-tray. How
beautiful she looked like that!&mdash;simply beautiful&mdash;and she was so
small in that immense chair. Reginald&rsquo;s heart swelled with tenderness,
but it was her voice, her soft voice, that made him tremble. &ldquo;I feel
you&rsquo;ve been here for years,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
Reginald took a deep breath of his cigarette. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ghastly, this
idea of going back,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Coo-roo-coo-coo-coo</i>,&rdquo; sounded from the quiet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re fond of being out there, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said
Anne. She hooked her finger through her pearl necklace. &ldquo;Father was
saying only the other night how lucky he thought you were to have a life of
your own.&rdquo; And she looked up at him. Reginald&rsquo;s smile was rather
wan. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel fearfully lucky,&rdquo; he said lightly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Roo-coo-coo-coo</i>,&rdquo; came again. And Anne murmured, &ldquo;You
mean it&rsquo;s lonely.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t the loneliness I care about,&rdquo; said Reginald,
and he stumped his cigarette savagely on the green ash-tray. &ldquo;I could
stand any amount of it, used to like it even. It&rsquo;s the idea
of&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly, to his horror, he felt himself blushing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Roo-coo-coo-coo! Roo-coo-coo-coo!</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Anne jumped up. &ldquo;Come and say good-bye to my doves,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been moved to the side veranda. You do like doves,
don&rsquo;t you, Reggie?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Awfully,&rdquo; said Reggie, so fervently that as he opened the French
window for her and stood to one side, Anne ran forward and laughed at the doves
instead.
</p>

<p>
To and fro, to and fro over the fine red sand on the floor of the dove house,
walked the two doves. One was always in front of the other. One ran forward,
uttering a little cry, and the other followed, solemnly bowing and bowing.
&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; explained Anne, &ldquo;the one in front, she&rsquo;s
Mrs. Dove. She looks at Mr. Dove and gives that little laugh and runs forward,
and he follows her, bowing and bowing. And that makes her laugh again. Away she
runs, and after her,&rdquo; cried Anne, and she sat back on her heels,
&ldquo;comes poor Mr. Dove, bowing and bowing... and that&rsquo;s their whole
life. They never do anything else, you know.&rdquo; She got up and took some
yellow grains out of a bag on the roof of the dove house. &ldquo;When you think
of them, out in Rhodesia, Reggie, you can be sure that is what they will be
doing....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Reggie gave no sign of having seen the doves or of having heard a word. For the
moment he was conscious only of the immense effort it took to tear his secret
out of himself and offer it to Anne. &ldquo;Anne, do you think you could ever
care for me?&rdquo; It was done. It was over. And in the little pause that
followed Reginald saw the garden open to the light, the blue quivering sky, the
flutter of leaves on the veranda poles, and Anne turning over the grains of
maize on her palm with one finger. Then slowly she shut her hand, and the new
world faded as she murmured slowly, &ldquo;No, never in that way.&rdquo; But he
had scarcely time to feel anything before she walked quickly away, and he
followed her down the steps, along the garden path, under the pink rose arches,
across the lawn. There, with the gay herbaceous border behind her, Anne faced
Reginald. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that I&rsquo;m not awfully fond of you,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I am. But&rdquo;&mdash;her eyes widened&mdash;&ldquo;not in
the way&rdquo;&mdash;a quiver passed over her face&mdash;&ldquo;one ought to be
fond of&mdash;&rdquo; Her lips parted, and she couldn&rsquo;t stop herself. She
began laughing. &ldquo;There, you see, you see,&rdquo; she cried,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s your check t-tie. Even at this moment, when one would think
one really would be solemn, your tie reminds me fearfully of the bow-tie that
cats wear in pictures! Oh, please forgive me for being so horrid,
please!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Reggie caught hold of her little warm hand. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no question of
forgiving you,&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;How could there be? And I do
believe I know why I make you laugh. It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re so far
above me in every way that I am somehow ridiculous. I see that, Anne. But if I
were to&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no.&rdquo; Anne squeezed his hand hard. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that.
That&rsquo;s all wrong. I&rsquo;m not far above you at all. You&rsquo;re much
better than I am. You&rsquo;re marvellously unselfish and... and kind and
simple. I&rsquo;m none of those things. You don&rsquo;t know me. I&rsquo;m the
most awful character,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t interrupt.
And besides, that&rsquo;s not the point. The point is&rdquo;&mdash;she shook
her head&mdash;&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t possibly marry a man I laughed at.
Surely you see that. The man I marry&mdash;&rdquo; breathed Anne softly. She
broke off. She drew her hand away, and looking at Reggie she smiled strangely,
dreamily. &ldquo;The man I marry&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And it seemed to Reggie that a tall, handsome, brilliant stranger stepped in
front of him and took his place&mdash;the kind of man that Anne and he had seen
often at the theatre, walking on to the stage from nowhere, without a word
catching the heroine in his arms, and after one long, tremendous look, carrying
her off to anywhere....
</p>

<p>
Reggie bowed to his vision. &ldquo;Yes, I see,&rdquo; he said huskily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;Oh, I do hope you do. Because I feel so
horrid about it. It&rsquo;s so hard to explain. You know I&rsquo;ve
never&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped. Reggie looked at her. She was smiling.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it funny?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can say anything to you.
I always have been able to from the very beginning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He tried to smile, to say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo; She went on.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never known anyone I like as much as I like you. I&rsquo;ve
never felt so happy with anyone. But I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not what people
and what books mean when they talk about love. Do you understand? Oh, if you
only knew how horrid I feel. But we&rsquo;d be like... like Mr. and Mrs.
Dove.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That did it. That seemed to Reginald final, and so terribly true that he could
hardly bear it. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drive it home,&rdquo; he said, and he turned
away from Anne and looked across the lawn. There was the gardener&rsquo;s
cottage, with the dark ilex-tree beside it. A wet, blue thumb of transparent
smoke hung above the chimney. It didn&rsquo;t look real. How his throat ached!
Could he speak? He had a shot. &ldquo;I must be getting along home,&rdquo; he
croaked, and he began walking across the lawn. But Anne ran after him.
&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t. You can&rsquo;t go yet,&rdquo; she said imploringly.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t possibly go away feeling like that.&rdquo; And she
stared up at him frowning, biting her lip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Reggie, giving himself a shake.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll... I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo; And he waved his hand as much to
say &ldquo;get over it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But this is awful,&rdquo; said Anne. She clasped her hands and stood in
front of him. &ldquo;Surely you do see how fatal it would be for us to marry,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, quite, quite,&rdquo; said Reggie, looking at her with haggard eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How wrong, how wicked, feeling as I do. I mean, it&rsquo;s all very well
for Mr. and Mrs. Dove. But imagine that in real life&mdash;imagine it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, absolutely,&rdquo; said Reggie, and he started to walk on. But again
Anne stopped him. She tugged at his sleeve, and to his astonishment, this time,
instead of laughing, she looked like a little girl who was going to cry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why, if you understand, are you so un-unhappy?&rdquo; she wailed.
&ldquo;Why do you mind so fearfully? Why do you look so aw-awful?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Reggie gulped, and again he waved something away. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help
it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a blow. If I cut off now, I&rsquo;ll
be able to&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can you talk of cutting off now?&rdquo; said Anne scornfully. She
stamped her foot at Reggie; she was crimson. &ldquo;How can you be so cruel? I
can&rsquo;t let you go until I know for certain that you are just as happy as
you were before you asked me to marry you. Surely you must see that, it&rsquo;s
so simple.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But it did not seem at all simple to Reginald. It seemed impossibly difficult.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Even if I can&rsquo;t marry you, how can I know that you&rsquo;re all
that way away, with only that awful mother to write to, and that you&rsquo;re
miserable, and that it&rsquo;s all my fault?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault. Don&rsquo;t think that. It&rsquo;s just
fate.&rdquo; Reggie took her hand off his sleeve and kissed it.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pity me, dear little Anne,&rdquo; he said gently. And this
time he nearly ran, under the pink arches, along the garden path.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Roo-coo-coo-coo! Roo-coo-coo-coo!</i>&rdquo; sounded from the
veranda. &ldquo;Reggie, Reggie,&rdquo; from the garden.
</p>

<p>
He stopped, he turned. But when she saw his timid, puzzled look, she gave a
little laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come back, Mr. Dove,&rdquo; said Anne. And Reginald came slowly across
the lawn.
</p>

<p>
<br /><br /><br /><br />
</p>

<p><a name="chap05"></a></p> <h2>The Young Girl</h2>

<p>
In her blue dress, with her cheeks lightly flushed, her blue, blue eyes, and
her gold curls pinned up as though for the first time&mdash;pinned up to be out
of the way for her flight&mdash;Mrs. Raddick&rsquo;s daughter might have just
dropped from this radiant heaven. Mrs. Raddick&rsquo;s timid, faintly
astonished, but deeply admiring glance looked as if she believed it, too; but
the daughter didn&rsquo;t appear any too pleased&mdash;why should she?&mdash;to
have alighted on the steps of the Casino. Indeed, she was bored&mdash;bored as
though Heaven had been full of casinos with snuffy old saints for
<i>croupiers</i> and crowns to play with.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind taking Hennie?&rdquo; said Mrs. Raddick.
&ldquo;Sure you don&rsquo;t? There&rsquo;s the car, and you&rsquo;ll have tea
and we&rsquo;ll be back here on this step&mdash;right here&mdash;in an hour.
You see, I want her to go in. She&rsquo;s not been before, and it&rsquo;s worth
seeing. I feel it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, shut up, mother,&rdquo; said she wearily. &ldquo;Come along.
Don&rsquo;t talk so much. And your bag&rsquo;s open; you&rsquo;ll be losing all
your money again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, darling,&rdquo; said Mrs. Raddick.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, <i>do</i> come in! I want to make money,&rdquo; said the impatient
voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all jolly well for you&mdash;but I&rsquo;m
broke!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here&mdash;take fifty francs, darling, take a hundred!&rdquo; I saw Mrs.
Raddick pressing notes into her hand as they passed through the swing doors.
</p>

<p>
Hennie and I stood on the steps a minute, watching the people. He had a very
broad, delighted smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s an English bulldog. Are
they allowed to take dogs in there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a ripping chap, isn&rsquo;t he? I wish I had one.
They&rsquo;re such fun. They frighten people so, and they&rsquo;re never fierce
with their&mdash;the people they belong to.&rdquo; Suddenly he squeezed my arm.
&ldquo;I say, <i>do</i> look at that old woman. Who is she? Why does she look
like that? Is she a gambler?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The ancient, withered creature, wearing a green satin dress, a black velvet
cloak and a white hat with purple feathers, jerked slowly, slowly up the steps
as though she were being drawn up on wires. She stared in front of her, she was
laughing and nodding and cackling to herself; her claws clutched round what
looked like a dirty boot-bag.
</p>

<p>
But just at that moment there was Mrs. Raddick again
with&mdash;<i>her</i>&mdash;and another lady hovering in the background. Mrs.
Raddick rushed at me. She was brightly flushed, gay, a different creature. She
was like a woman who is saying &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo; to her friends on the
station platform, with not a minute to spare before the train starts.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re here, still. Isn&rsquo;t that lucky! You&rsquo;ve not
gone. Isn&rsquo;t that fine! I&rsquo;ve had the most dreadful time
with&mdash;her,&rdquo; and she waved to her daughter, who stood absolutely
still, disdainful, looking down, twiddling her foot on the step, miles away.
&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t let her in. I swore she was twenty-one. But they
won&rsquo;t believe me. I showed the man my purse; I didn&rsquo;t dare to do
more. But it was no use. He simply scoffed.... And now I&rsquo;ve just met Mrs.
MacEwen from New York, and she just won thirteen thousand in the <i>Salle
Privée</i>&mdash;and she wants me to go back with her while the luck lasts. Of
course I can&rsquo;t leave&mdash;her. But if you&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At that &ldquo;she&rdquo; looked up; she simply withered her mother. &ldquo;Why
can&rsquo;t you leave me?&rdquo; she said furiously. &ldquo;What utter rot! How
dare you make a scene like this? This is the last time I&rsquo;ll come out with
you. You really are too awful for words.&rdquo; She looked her mother up and
down. &ldquo;Calm yourself,&rdquo; she said superbly.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Raddick was desperate, just desperate. She was &ldquo;wild&rdquo; to go
back with Mrs. MacEwen, but at the same time....
</p>

<p>
I seized my courage. &ldquo;Would you&mdash;do you care to come to tea
with&mdash;us?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes, she&rsquo;ll be delighted. That&rsquo;s just what I wanted,
isn&rsquo;t it, darling? Mrs. MacEwen... I&rsquo;ll be back here in an hour...
or less... I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. R. dashed up the steps. I saw her bag was open again.
</p>

<p>
So we three were left. But really it wasn&rsquo;t my fault. Hennie looked
crushed to the earth, too. When the car was there she wrapped her dark coat
round her&mdash;to escape contamination. Even her little feet looked as though
they scorned to carry her down the steps to us.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am so awfully sorry,&rdquo; I murmured as the car started.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t <i>mind</i>,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
<i>want</i> to look twenty-one. Who would&mdash;if they were seventeen!
It&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;and she gave a faint shudder&mdash;&ldquo;the stupidity
I loathe, and being stared at by old fat men. Beasts!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hennie gave her a quick look and then peered out of the window.
</p>

<p>
We drew up before an immense palace of pink-and-white marble with orange-trees
outside the doors in gold-and-black tubs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you care to go in?&rdquo; I suggested.
</p>

<p>
She hesitated, glanced, bit her lip, and resigned herself. &ldquo;Oh well,
there seems nowhere else,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Get out, Hennie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I went first&mdash;to find the table, of course&mdash;she followed. But the
worst of it was having her little brother, who was only twelve, with us. That
was the last, final straw&mdash;having that child, trailing at her heels.
</p>

<p>
There was one table. It had pink carnations and pink plates with little blue
tea-napkins for sails.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall we sit here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She put her hand wearily on the back of a white wicker chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We may as well. Why not?&rdquo; said she.
</p>

<p>
Hennie squeezed past her and wriggled on to a stool at the end. He felt awfully
out of it. She didn&rsquo;t even take her gloves off. She lowered her eyes and
drummed on the table. When a faint violin sounded she winced and bit her lip
again. Silence.
</p>

<p>
The waitress appeared. I hardly dared to ask her. &ldquo;Tea&mdash;coffee?
China tea&mdash;or iced tea with lemon?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Really she didn&rsquo;t mind. It was all the same to her. She didn&rsquo;t
really want anything. Hennie whispered, &ldquo;Chocolate!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But just as the waitress turned away she cried out carelessly, &ldquo;Oh, you
may as well bring me a chocolate, too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
While we waited she took out a little, gold powder-box with a mirror in the
lid, shook the poor little puff as though she loathed it, and dabbed her lovely
nose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hennie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;take those flowers away.&rdquo; She
pointed with her puff to the carnations, and I heard her murmur, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t bear flowers on a table.&rdquo; They had evidently been giving her
intense pain, for she positively closed her eyes as I moved them away.
</p>

<p>
The waitress came back with the chocolate and the tea. She put the big,
frothing cups before them and pushed across my clear glass. Hennie buried his
nose, emerged, with, for one dreadful moment, a little trembling blob of cream
on the tip. But he hastily wiped it off like a little gentleman. I wondered if
I should dare draw her attention to her cup. She didn&rsquo;t notice
it&mdash;didn&rsquo;t see it&mdash;until suddenly, quite by chance, she took a
sip. I watched anxiously; she faintly shuddered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dreadfully sweet!&rdquo; said she.
</p>

<p>
A tiny boy with a head like a raisin and a chocolate body came round with a
tray of pastries&mdash;row upon row of little freaks, little inspirations,
little melting dreams. He offered them to her. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not at all
hungry. Take them away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He offered them to Hennie. Hennie gave me a swift look&mdash;it must have been
satisfactory&mdash;for he took a chocolate cream, a coffee éclair, a meringue
stuffed with chestnut and a tiny horn filled with fresh strawberries. She could
hardly bear to watch him. But just as the boy swerved away she held up her
plate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh well, give me <i>one</i>,&rdquo; said she.
</p>

<p>
The silver tongs dropped one, two, three&mdash;and a cherry tartlet. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re giving me all these,&rdquo; she said, and
nearly smiled. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t eat them; I couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I felt much more comfortable. I sipped my tea, leaned back, and even asked if I
might smoke. At that she paused, the fork in her hand, opened her eyes, and
really did smile. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I always expect
people to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But at that moment a tragedy happened to Hennie. He speared his pastry horn too
hard, and it flew in two, and one half spilled on the table. Ghastly affair! He
turned crimson. Even his ears flared, and one ashamed hand crept across the
table to take what was left of the body away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You <i>utter</i> little beast!&rdquo; said she.
</p>

<p>
Good heavens! I had to fly to the rescue. I cried hastily, &ldquo;Will you be
abroad long?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But she had already forgotten Hennie. I was forgotten, too. She was trying to
remember something.... She was miles away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;know,&rdquo; she said slowly, from that far
place.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you prefer it to London. It&rsquo;s
more&mdash;more&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When I didn&rsquo;t go on she came back and looked at me, very puzzled.
&ldquo;More&mdash;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Enfin</i>&mdash;gayer,&rdquo; I cried, waving my cigarette.
</p>

<p>
But that took a whole cake to consider. Even then, &ldquo;Oh well, that
depends!&rdquo; was all she could safely say.
</p>

<p>
Hennie had finished. He was still very warm.
</p>

<p>
I seized the butterfly list off the table. &ldquo;I say&mdash;what about an
ice, Hennie? What about tangerine and ginger? No, something cooler. What about
a fresh pineapple cream?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hennie strongly approved. The waitress had her eye on us. The order was taken
when she looked up from her crumbs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you say tangerine and ginger? I like ginger. You can bring me
one.&rdquo; And then quickly, &ldquo;I wish that orchestra wouldn&rsquo;t play
things from the year One. We were dancing to that all last Christmas.
It&rsquo;s too sickening!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But it was a charming air. Now that I noticed it, it warmed me.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think this is rather a nice place, don&rsquo;t you, Hennie?&rdquo; I
said.
</p>

<p>
Hennie said: &ldquo;Ripping!&rdquo; He meant to say it very low, but it came
out very high in a kind of squeak.
</p>

<p>
Nice? This place? Nice? For the first time she stared about her, trying to see
what there was.... She blinked; her lovely eyes wondered. A very good-looking
elderly man stared back at her through a monocle on a black ribbon. But him she
simply couldn&rsquo;t see. There was a hole in the air where he was. She looked
through and through him.
</p>

<p>
Finally the little flat spoons lay still on the glass plates. Hennie looked
rather exhausted, but she pulled on her white gloves again. She had some
trouble with her diamond wrist-watch; it got in her way. She tugged at
it&mdash;tried to break the stupid little thing&mdash;it wouldn&rsquo;t break.
Finally, she had to drag her glove over. I saw, after that, she couldn&rsquo;t
stand this place a moment longer, and, indeed, she jumped up and turned away
while I went through the vulgar act of paying for the tea.
</p>

<p>
And then we were outside again. It had grown dusky. The sky was sprinkled with
small stars; the big lamps glowed. While we waited for the car to come up she
stood on the step, just as before, twiddling her foot, looking down.
</p>

<p>
Hennie bounded forward to open the door and she got in and sank back
with&mdash;oh&mdash;such a sigh!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;to drive as fast as he can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hennie grinned at his friend the chauffeur. &ldquo;<i>Allie veet!</i>&rdquo;
said he. Then he composed himself and sat on the small seat facing us.
</p>

<p>
The gold powder-box came out again. Again the poor little puff was shaken;
again there was that swift, deadly-secret glance between her and the mirror.
</p>

<p>
We tore through the black-and-gold town like a pair of scissors tearing through
brocade. Hennie had great difficulty not to look as though he were hanging on
to something.
</p>

<p>
And when we reached the Casino, of course Mrs. Raddick wasn&rsquo;t there.
There wasn&rsquo;t a sign of her on the steps&mdash;not a sign.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you stay in the car while I go and look?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But no&mdash;she wouldn&rsquo;t do that. Good heavens, no! Hennie could stay.
She couldn&rsquo;t bear sitting in a car. She&rsquo;d wait on the steps.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I scarcely like to leave you,&rdquo; I murmured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
very much rather not leave you here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At that she threw back her coat; she turned and faced me; her lips parted.
&ldquo;Good heavens&mdash;why! I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mind it a bit. I&mdash;I
like waiting.&rdquo; And suddenly her cheeks crimsoned, her eyes grew
dark&mdash;for a moment I thought she was going to cry. &ldquo;L&mdash;let me,
please,&rdquo; she stammered, in a warm, eager voice. &ldquo;I like it. I love
waiting! Really&mdash;really I do! I&rsquo;m always waiting&mdash;in all kinds
of places....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her dark coat fell open, and her white throat&mdash;all her soft young body in
the blue dress&mdash;was like a flower that is just emerging from its dark bud.
</p>

<p>
<br /><br /><br /><br />
</p>

<p><a name="chap06"></a></p> <h2>Life of Ma Parker</h2>

<p>
When the literary gentleman, whose flat old Ma Parker cleaned every Tuesday,
opened the door to her that morning, he asked after her grandson. Ma Parker
stood on the doormat inside the dark little hall, and she stretched out her
hand to help her gentleman shut the door before she replied. &ldquo;We buried
&rsquo;im yesterday, sir,&rdquo; she said quietly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, dear me! I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that,&rdquo; said the literary
gentleman in a shocked tone. He was in the middle of his breakfast. He wore a
very shabby dressing-gown and carried a crumpled newspaper in one hand. But he
felt awkward. He could hardly go back to the warm sitting-room without saying
something&mdash;something more. Then because these people set such store by
funerals he said kindly, &ldquo;I hope the funeral went off all right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Beg parding, sir?&rdquo; said old Ma Parker huskily.
</p>

<p>
Poor old bird! She did look dashed. &ldquo;I hope the funeral was
a&mdash;a&mdash;success,&rdquo; said he. Ma Parker gave no answer. She bent her
head and hobbled off to the kitchen, clasping the old fish bag that held her
cleaning things and an apron and a pair of felt shoes. The literary gentleman
raised his eyebrows and went back to his breakfast.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Overcome, I suppose,&rdquo; he said aloud, helping himself to the
marmalade.
</p>

<p>
Ma Parker drew the two jetty spears out of her toque and hung it behind the
door. She unhooked her worn jacket and hung that up too. Then she tied her
apron and sat down to take off her boots. To take off her boots or to put them
on was an agony to her, but it had been an agony for years. In fact, she was so
accustomed to the pain that her face was drawn and screwed up ready for the
twinge before she&rsquo;d so much as untied the laces. That over, she sat back
with a sigh and softly rubbed her knees....<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gran! Gran!&rdquo; Her little grandson stood on her lap in his button
boots. He&rsquo;d just come in from playing in the street.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look what a state you&rsquo;ve made your gran&rsquo;s skirt
into&mdash;you wicked boy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But he put his arms round her neck and rubbed his cheek against hers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gran, gi&rsquo; us a penny!&rdquo; he coaxed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be off with you; Gran ain&rsquo;t got no pennies.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you &rsquo;ave.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you &rsquo;ave. Gi&rsquo; us one!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Already she was feeling for the old, squashed, black leather purse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;ll you give your gran?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He gave a shy little laugh and pressed closer. She felt his eyelid quivering
against her cheek. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got nothing,&rdquo; he murmured....
<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
The old woman sprang up, seized the iron kettle off the gas stove and took it
over to the sink. The noise of the water drumming in the kettle deadened her
pain, it seemed. She filled the pail, too, and the washing-up bowl.
</p>

<p>
It would take a whole book to describe the state of that kitchen. During the
week the literary gentleman &ldquo;did&rdquo; for himself. That is to say, he
emptied the tea leaves now and again into a jam jar set aside for that purpose,
and if he ran out of clean forks he wiped over one or two on the roller towel.
Otherwise, as he explained to his friends, his &ldquo;system&rdquo; was quite
simple, and he couldn&rsquo;t understand why people made all this fuss about
housekeeping.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You simply dirty everything you&rsquo;ve got, get a hag in once a week
to clean up, and the thing&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The result looked like a gigantic dustbin. Even the floor was littered with
toast crusts, envelopes, cigarette ends. But Ma Parker bore him no grudge. She
pitied the poor young gentleman for having no one to look after him. Out of the
smudgy little window you could see an immense expanse of sad-looking sky, and
whenever there were clouds they looked very worn, old clouds, frayed at the
edges, with holes in them, or dark stains like tea.
</p>

<p>
While the water was heating, Ma Parker began sweeping the floor.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she thought, as the broom knocked, &ldquo;what with one
thing and another I&rsquo;ve had my share. I&rsquo;ve had a hard life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Even the neighbours said that of her. Many a time, hobbling home with her fish
bag she heard them, waiting at the corner, or leaning over the area railings,
say among themselves, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s had a hard life, has Ma Parker.&rdquo;
And it was so true she wasn&rsquo;t in the least proud of it. It was just as if
you were to say she lived in the basement-back at Number 27. A hard life!...
<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
At sixteen she&rsquo;d left Stratford and come up to London as kitching-maid.
Yes, she was born in Stratford-on-Avon. Shakespeare, sir? No, people were
always arsking her about him. But she&rsquo;d never heard his name until she
saw it on the theatres.
</p>

<p>
Nothing remained of Stratford except that &ldquo;sitting in the fire-place of a
evening you could see the stars through the chimley,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mother
always &rsquo;ad &rsquo;er side of bacon, &rsquo;anging from the
ceiling.&rdquo; And there was something&mdash;a bush, there was&mdash;at the
front door, that smelt ever so nice. But the bush was very vague. She&rsquo;d
only remembered it once or twice in the hospital, when she&rsquo;d been taken
bad.
</p>

<p>
That was a dreadful place&mdash;her first place. She was never allowed out. She
never went upstairs except for prayers morning and evening. It was a fair
cellar. And the cook was a cruel woman. She used to snatch away her letters
from home before she&rsquo;d read them, and throw them in the range because
they made her dreamy.... And the beedles! Would you believe it?&mdash;until she
came to London she&rsquo;d never seen a black beedle. Here Ma always gave a
little laugh, as though&mdash;not to have seen a black beedle! Well! It was as
if to say you&rsquo;d never seen your own feet.
</p>

<p>
When that family was sold up she went as &ldquo;help&rdquo; to a doctor&rsquo;s
house, and after two years there, on the run from morning till night, she
married her husband. He was a baker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A baker, Mrs. Parker!&rdquo; the literary gentleman would say. For
occasionally he laid aside his tomes and lent an ear, at least, to this product
called Life. &ldquo;It must be rather nice to be married to a baker!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Parker didn&rsquo;t look so sure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Such a clean trade,&rdquo; said the gentleman.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Parker didn&rsquo;t look convinced.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t you like handing the new loaves to the
customers?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Parker, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t in the shop
above a great deal. We had thirteen little ones and buried seven of them. If it
wasn&rsquo;t the &rsquo;ospital it was the infirmary, you might say!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You might, <i>indeed</i>, Mrs. Parker!&rdquo; said the gentleman,
shuddering, and taking up his pen again.
</p>

<p>
Yes, seven had gone, and while the six were still small her husband was taken
ill with consumption. It was flour on the lungs, the doctor told her at the
time.... Her husband sat up in bed with his shirt pulled over his head, and the
doctor&rsquo;s finger drew a circle on his back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, if we were to cut him open <i>here</i>, Mrs. Parker,&rdquo; said
the doctor, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d find his lungs chock-a-block with white powder.
Breathe, my good fellow!&rdquo; And Mrs. Parker never knew for certain whether
she saw or whether she fancied she saw a great fan of white dust come out of
her poor dead husband&rsquo;s lips....
</p>

<p>
But the struggle she&rsquo;d had to bring up those six little children and keep
herself to herself. Terrible it had been! Then, just when they were old enough
to go to school her husband&rsquo;s sister came to stop with them to help
things along, and she hadn&rsquo;t been there more than two months when she
fell down a flight of steps and hurt her spine. And for five years Ma Parker
had another baby&mdash;and such a one for crying!&mdash;to look after. Then
young Maudie went wrong and took her sister Alice with her; the two boys
emigrated, and young Jim went to India with the army, and Ethel, the youngest,
married a good-for-nothing little waiter who died of ulcers the year little
Lennie was born. And now little Lennie&mdash;my grandson....
</p>

<p>
The piles of dirty cups, dirty dishes, were washed and dried. The ink-black
knives were cleaned with a piece of potato and finished off with a piece of
cork. The table was scrubbed, and the dresser and the sink that had sardine
tails swimming in it....
</p>

<p>
He&rsquo;d never been a strong child&mdash;never from the first. He&rsquo;d
been one of those fair babies that everybody took for a girl. Silvery fair
curls he had, blue eyes, and a little freckle like a diamond on one side of his
nose. The trouble she and Ethel had had to rear that child! The things out of
the newspapers they tried him with! Every Sunday morning Ethel would read aloud
while Ma Parker did her washing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear Sir,&mdash;Just a line to let you know my little Myrtil was laid
out for dead.... After four bottils... gained 8 lbs. in 9 weeks, <i>and is still
putting it on</i>.&rdquo;<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
And then the egg-cup of ink would come off the dresser and the letter would be
written, and Ma would buy a postal order on her way to work next morning. But
it was no use. Nothing made little Lennie put it on. Taking him to the
cemetery, even, never gave him a colour; a nice shake-up in the bus never
improved his appetite.
</p>

<p>
But he was gran&rsquo;s boy from the first....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whose boy are you?&rdquo; said old Ma Parker, straightening up from the
stove and going over to the smudgy window. And a little voice, so warm, so
close, it half stifled her&mdash;it seemed to be in her breast under her
heart&mdash;laughed out, and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gran&rsquo;s boy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At that moment there was a sound of steps, and the literary gentleman appeared,
dressed for walking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Parker, I&rsquo;m going out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll find your half-crown in the tray of the
inkstand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, by the way, Mrs. Parker,&rdquo; said the literary gentleman quickly,
&ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t throw away any cocoa last time you were here&mdash;did
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Very</i> strange. I could have sworn I left a teaspoonful of cocoa in
the tin.&rdquo; He broke off. He said softly and firmly, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
always tell me when you throw things away&mdash;won&rsquo;t you, Mrs.
Parker?&rdquo; And he walked off very well pleased with himself, convinced, in
fact, he&rsquo;d shown Mrs. Parker that under his apparent carelessness he was
as vigilant as a woman.
</p>

<p>
The door banged. She took her brushes and cloths into the bedroom. But when she
began to make the bed, smoothing, tucking, patting, the thought of little
Lennie was unbearable. Why did he have to suffer so? That&rsquo;s what she
couldn&rsquo;t understand. Why should a little angel child have to arsk for his
breath and fight for it? There was no sense in making a child suffer like that.
</p>

<p>
... From Lennie&rsquo;s little box of a chest there came a sound as though
something was boiling. There was a great lump of something bubbling in his
chest that he couldn&rsquo;t get rid of. When he coughed the sweat sprang out
on his head; his eyes bulged, his hands waved, and the great lump bubbled as a
potato knocks in a saucepan. But what was more awful than all was when he
didn&rsquo;t cough he sat against the pillow and never spoke or answered, or
even made as if he heard. Only he looked offended.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your poor old gran&rsquo;s doing it, my lovey,&rdquo;
said old Ma Parker, patting back the damp hair from his little scarlet ears.
But Lennie moved his head and edged away. Dreadfully offended with her he
looked&mdash;and solemn. He bent his head and looked at her sideways as though
he couldn&rsquo;t have believed it of his gran.
</p>

<p>
But at the last... Ma Parker threw the counterpane over the bed. No, she simply
couldn&rsquo;t think about it. It was too much&mdash;she&rsquo;d had too much
in her life to bear. She&rsquo;d borne it up till now, she&rsquo;d kept herself
to herself, and never once had she been seen to cry. Never by a living soul.
Not even her own children had seen Ma break down. She&rsquo;d kept a proud face
always. But now! Lennie gone&mdash;what had she? She had nothing. He was all
she&rsquo;d got from life, and now he was took too. Why must it all have
happened to me? she wondered. &ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo; said old Ma
Parker. &ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As she said those words she suddenly let fall her brush. She found herself in
the kitchen. Her misery was so terrible that she pinned on her hat, put on her
jacket and walked out of the flat like a person in a dream. She did not know
what she was doing. She was like a person so dazed by the horror of what has
happened that he walks away&mdash;anywhere, as though by walking away he could
escape....<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
It was cold in the street. There was a wind like ice. People went flitting by,
very fast; the men walked like scissors; the women trod like cats. And nobody
knew&mdash;nobody cared. Even if she broke down, if at last, after all these
years, she were to cry, she&rsquo;d find herself in the lock-up as like as not.
</p>

<p>
But at the thought of crying it was as though little Lennie leapt in his
gran&rsquo;s arms. Ah, that&rsquo;s what she wants to do, my dove. Gran wants
to cry. If she could only cry now, cry for a long time, over everything,
beginning with her first place and the cruel cook, going on to the
doctor&rsquo;s, and then the seven little ones, death of her husband, the
children&rsquo;s leaving her, and all the years of misery that led up to
Lennie. But to have a proper cry over all these things would take a long time.
All the same, the time for it had come. She must do it. She couldn&rsquo;t put
it off any longer; she couldn&rsquo;t wait any more.... Where could she go?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s had a hard life, has Ma Parker.&rdquo; Yes, a hard life,
indeed! Her chin began to tremble; there was no time to lose. But where? Where?
</p>

<p>
She couldn&rsquo;t go home; Ethel was there. It would frighten Ethel out of her
life. She couldn&rsquo;t sit on a bench anywhere; people would come arsking her
questions. She couldn&rsquo;t possibly go back to the gentleman&rsquo;s flat;
she had no right to cry in strangers&rsquo; houses. If she sat on some steps a
policeman would speak to her.
</p>

<p>
Oh, wasn&rsquo;t there anywhere where she could hide and keep herself to
herself and stay as long as she liked, not disturbing anybody, and nobody
worrying her? Wasn&rsquo;t there anywhere in the world where she could have her
cry out&mdash;at last?
</p>

<p>
Ma Parker stood, looking up and down. The icy wind blew out her apron into a
balloon. And now it began to rain. There was nowhere.

<p><a name="chap07"></a></p> <h2>Marriage à la Mode</h2>

<p>
On his way to the station William remembered with a fresh pang of
disappointment that he was taking nothing down to the kiddies. Poor little
chaps! It was hard lines on them. Their first words always were as they ran to
greet him, &ldquo;What have you got for me, daddy?&rdquo; and he had nothing.
He would have to buy them some sweets at the station. But that was what he had
done for the past four Saturdays; their faces had fallen last time when they
saw the same old boxes produced again.
</p>

<p>
And Paddy had said, &ldquo;I had red ribbing on mine <i>bee</i>-fore!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Johnny had said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always pink on mine. I hate pink.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But what was William to do? The affair wasn&rsquo;t so easily settled. In the
old days, of course, he would have taken a taxi off to a decent toyshop and
chosen them something in five minutes. But nowadays they had Russian toys,
French toys, Serbian toys&mdash;toys from God knows where. It was over a year
since Isabel had scrapped the old donkeys and engines and so on because they
were so &ldquo;dreadfully sentimental&rdquo; and &ldquo;so appallingly bad for
the babies&rsquo; sense of form.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so important,&rdquo; the new Isabel had explained,
&ldquo;that they should like the right things from the very beginning. It saves
so much time later on. Really, if the poor pets have to spend their infant
years staring at these horrors, one can imagine them growing up and asking to
be taken to the Royal Academy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And she spoke as though a visit to the Royal Academy was certain immediate
death to anyone....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said William slowly. &ldquo;When I was
their age I used to go to bed hugging an old towel with a knot in it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The new Isabel looked at him, her eyes narrowed, her lips apart.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Dear</i> William! I&rsquo;m sure you did!&rdquo; She laughed in the
new way.
</p>

<p>
Sweets it would have to be, however, thought William gloomily, fishing in his
pocket for change for the taxi-man. And he saw the kiddies handing the boxes
round&mdash;they were awfully generous little chaps&mdash;while Isabel&rsquo;s
precious friends didn&rsquo;t hesitate to help themselves....
</p>

<p>
What about fruit? William hovered before a stall just inside the station. What
about a melon each? Would they have to share that, too? Or a pineapple, for
Pad, and a melon for Johnny? Isabel&rsquo;s friends could hardly go sneaking up
to the nursery at the children&rsquo;s meal-times. All the same, as he bought
the melon William had a horrible vision of one of Isabel&rsquo;s young poets
lapping up a slice, for some reason, behind the nursery door.
</p>

<p>
With his two very awkward parcels he strode off to his train. The platform was
crowded, the train was in. Doors banged open and shut. There came such a loud
hissing from the engine that people looked dazed as they scurried to and fro.
William made straight for a first-class smoker, stowed away his suit-case and
parcels, and taking a huge wad of papers out of his inner pocket, he flung down
in the corner and began to read.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Our client moreover is positive.... We are inclined to reconsider... in
the event of&mdash;&rdquo; Ah, that was better. William pressed back his
flattened hair and stretched his legs across the carriage floor. The familiar
dull gnawing in his breast quietened down. &ldquo;With regard to our
decision&mdash;&rdquo; He took out a blue pencil and scored a paragraph slowly.
</p>

<p>
Two men came in, stepped across him, and made for the farther corner. A young
fellow swung his golf clubs into the rack and sat down opposite. The train gave
a gentle lurch, they were off. William glanced up and saw the hot, bright
station slipping away. A red-faced girl raced along by the carriages, there was
something strained and almost desperate in the way she waved and called.
&ldquo;Hysterical!&rdquo; thought William dully. Then a greasy, black-faced
workman at the end of the platform grinned at the passing train. And William
thought, &ldquo;A filthy life!&rdquo; and went back to his papers.
</p>

<p>
When he looked up again there were fields, and beasts standing for shelter
under the dark trees. A wide river, with naked children splashing in the
shallows, glided into sight and was gone again. The sky shone pale, and one
bird drifted high like a dark fleck in a jewel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We have examined our client&rsquo;s correspondence files....&rdquo; The
last sentence he had read echoed in his mind. &ldquo;We have
examined....&rdquo; William hung on to that sentence, but it was no good; it
snapped in the middle, and the fields, the sky, the sailing bird, the water,
all said, &ldquo;Isabel.&rdquo; The same thing happened every Saturday
afternoon. When he was on his way to meet Isabel there began those countless
imaginary meetings. She was at the station, standing just a little apart from
everybody else; she was sitting in the open taxi outside; she was at the garden
gate; walking across the parched grass; at the door, or just inside the hall.
</p>

<p>
And her clear, light voice said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s William,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Hillo, William!&rdquo; or &ldquo;So William has come!&rdquo; He touched
her cool hand, her cool cheek.
</p>

<p>
The exquisite freshness of Isabel! When he had been a little boy, it was his
delight to run into the garden after a shower of rain and shake the rose-bush
over him. Isabel was that rose-bush, petal-soft, sparkling and cool. And he was
still that little boy. But there was no running into the garden now, no
laughing and shaking. The dull, persistent gnawing in his breast started again.
He drew up his legs, tossed the papers aside, and shut his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it, Isabel? What is it?&rdquo; he said tenderly. They were in
their bedroom in the new house. Isabel sat on a painted stool before the
dressing-table that was strewn with little black and green boxes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is what, William?&rdquo; And she bent forward, and her fine light
hair fell over her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you know!&rdquo; He stood in the middle of the room and he felt a
stranger. At that Isabel wheeled round quickly and faced him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, William!&rdquo; she cried imploringly, and she held up the
hair-brush: &ldquo;Please! Please don&rsquo;t be so dreadfully stuffy
and&mdash;tragic. You&rsquo;re always saying or looking or hinting that
I&rsquo;ve changed. Just because I&rsquo;ve got to know really congenial
people, and go about more, and am frightfully keen on&mdash;on everything, you
behave as though I&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo; Isabel tossed back her hair and
laughed&mdash;&ldquo;killed our love or something. It&rsquo;s so awfully
absurd&rdquo;&mdash;she bit her lip&mdash;&ldquo;and it&rsquo;s so maddening,
William. Even this new house and the servants you grudge me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isabel!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes, it&rsquo;s true in a way,&rdquo; said Isabel quickly.
&ldquo;You think they are another bad sign. Oh, I know you do. I feel
it,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;every time you come up the stairs. But we
couldn&rsquo;t have gone on living in that other poky little hole, William. Be
practical, at least! Why, there wasn&rsquo;t enough room for the babies
even.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
No, it was true. Every morning when he came back from chambers it was to find
the babies with Isabel in the back drawing-room. They were having rides on the
leopard skin thrown over the sofa back, or they were playing shops with
Isabel&rsquo;s desk for a counter, or Pad was sitting on the hearthrug rowing
away for dear life with a little brass fire shovel, while Johnny shot at
pirates with the tongs. Every evening they each had a pick-a-back up the narrow
stairs to their fat old Nanny.
</p>

<p>
Yes, he supposed it was a poky little house. A little white house with blue
curtains and a window-box of petunias. William met their friends at the door
with &ldquo;Seen our petunias? Pretty terrific for London, don&rsquo;t you
think?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But the imbecile thing, the absolutely extraordinary thing was that he
hadn&rsquo;t the slightest idea that Isabel wasn&rsquo;t as happy as he. God,
what blindness! He hadn&rsquo;t the remotest notion in those days that she
really hated that inconvenient little house, that she thought the fat Nanny was
ruining the babies, that she was desperately lonely, pining for new people and
new music and pictures and so on. If they hadn&rsquo;t gone to that studio
party at Moira Morrison&rsquo;s&mdash;if Moira Morrison hadn&rsquo;t said as
they were leaving, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to rescue your wife, selfish man.
She&rsquo;s like an exquisite little Titania&rdquo;&mdash;if Isabel
hadn&rsquo;t gone with Moira to Paris&mdash;if&mdash;if....
</p>

<p>
The train stopped at another station. Bettingford. Good heavens! They&rsquo;d
be there in ten minutes. William stuffed that papers back into his pockets; the
young man opposite had long since disappeared. Now the other two got out. The
late afternoon sun shone on women in cotton frocks and little sunburnt,
barefoot children. It blazed on a silky yellow flower with coarse leaves which
sprawled over a bank of rock. The air ruffling through the window smelled of
the sea. Had Isabel the same crowd with her this week-end, wondered William?
</p>

<p>
And he remembered the holidays they used to have, the four of them, with a
little farm girl, Rose, to look after the babies. Isabel wore a jersey and her
hair in a plait; she looked about fourteen. Lord! how his nose used to peel!
And the amount they ate, and the amount they slept in that immense feather bed
with their feet locked together.... William couldn&rsquo;t help a grim smile as
he thought of Isabel&rsquo;s horror if she knew the full extent of his
sentimentality.
</p>

<p>
<br /><br />
</p>

<hr />

<p>
<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hillo, William!&rdquo; She was at the station after all, standing just
as he had imagined, apart from the others, and&mdash;William&rsquo;s heart
leapt&mdash;she was alone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hallo, Isabel!&rdquo; William stared. He thought she looked so beautiful
that he had to say something, &ldquo;You look very cool.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; said Isabel. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel very cool. Come
along, your horrid old train is late. The taxi&rsquo;s outside.&rdquo; She put
her hand lightly on his arm as they passed the ticket collector.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all come to meet you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But
we&rsquo;ve left Bobby Kane at the sweet shop, to be called for.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said William. It was all he could say for the moment.
</p>

<p>
There in the glare waited the taxi, with Bill Hunt and Dennis Green sprawling
on one side, their hats tilted over their faces, while on the other, Moira
Morrison, in a bonnet like a huge strawberry, jumped up and down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No ice! No ice! No ice!&rdquo; she shouted gaily.
</p>

<p>
And Dennis chimed in from under his hat. &ldquo;<i>Only</i> to be had from the
fishmonger&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Bill Hunt, emerging, added, &ldquo;With <i>whole</i> fish in it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, what a bore!&rdquo; wailed Isabel. And she explained to William how
they had been chasing round the town for ice while she waited for him.
&ldquo;Simply everything is running down the steep cliffs into the sea,
beginning with the butter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shall have to anoint ourselves with butter,&rdquo; said Dennis.
&ldquo;May thy head, William, lack not ointment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said William, &ldquo;how are we going to sit?
I&rsquo;d better get up by the driver.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Bobby Kane&rsquo;s by the driver,&rdquo; said Isabel.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to sit between Moira and me.&rdquo; The taxi started.
&ldquo;What have you got in those mysterious parcels?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;De-cap-it-ated heads!&rdquo; said Bill Hunt, shuddering beneath his hat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, fruit!&rdquo; Isabel sounded very pleased. &ldquo;Wise William! A
melon and a pineapple. How too nice!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, wait a bit,&rdquo; said William, smiling. But he really was anxious.
&ldquo;I brought them down for the kiddies.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my dear!&rdquo; Isabel laughed, and slipped her hand through his
arm. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d be rolling in agonies if they were to eat them.
No&rdquo;&mdash;she patted his hand&mdash;&ldquo;you must bring them something
next time. I refuse to part with my pineapple.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cruel Isabel! Do let me smell it!&rdquo; said Moira. She flung her arms
across William appealingly. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; The strawberry bonnet fell
forward: she sounded quite faint.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A Lady in Love with a Pineapple,&rdquo; said Dennis, as the taxi drew up
before a little shop with a striped blind. Out came Bobby Kane, his arms full
of little packets.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do hope they&rsquo;ll be good. I&rsquo;ve chosen them because of the
colours. There are some round things which really look too divine. And just
look at this nougat,&rdquo; he cried ecstatically, &ldquo;just look at it!
It&rsquo;s a perfect little ballet!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But at that moment the shopman appeared. &ldquo;Oh, I forgot. They&rsquo;re
none of them paid for,&rdquo; said Bobby, looking frightened. Isabel gave the
shopman a note, and Bobby was radiant again. &ldquo;Hallo, William! I&rsquo;m
sitting by the driver.&rdquo; And bareheaded, all in white, with his sleeves
rolled up to the shoulders, he leapt into his place. &ldquo;Avanti!&rdquo; he
cried....
</p>

<p>
After tea the others went off to bathe, while William stayed and made his peace
with the kiddies. But Johnny and Paddy were asleep, the rose-red glow had
paled, bats were flying, and still the bathers had not returned. As William
wandered downstairs, the maid crossed the hall carrying a lamp. He followed her
into the sitting-room. It was a long room, coloured yellow. On the wall
opposite William some one had painted a young man, over life-size, with very
wobbly legs, offering a wide-eyed daisy to a young woman who had one very short
arm and one very long, thin one. Over the chairs and sofa there hung strips of
black material, covered with big splashes like broken eggs, and everywhere one
looked there seemed to be an ash-tray full of cigarette ends. William sat down
in one of the arm-chairs. Nowadays, when one felt with one hand down the sides,
it wasn&rsquo;t to come upon a sheep with three legs or a cow that had lost one
horn, or a very fat dove out of the Noah&rsquo;s Ark. One fished up yet another
little paper-covered book of smudged-looking poems.... He thought of the wad of
papers in his pocket, but he was too hungry and tired to read. The door was
open; sounds came from the kitchen. The servants were talking as if they were
alone in the house. Suddenly there came a loud screech of laughter and an
equally loud &ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; They had remembered him. William got up and went
through the French windows into the garden, and as he stood there in the shadow
he heard the bathers coming up the sandy road; their voices rang through the
quiet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think its up to Moira to use her little arts and wiles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A tragic moan from Moira.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We ought to have a gramophone for the week-ends that played &lsquo;The
Maid of the Mountains.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no! Oh no!&rdquo; cried Isabel&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not
fair to William. Be nice to him, my children! He&rsquo;s only staying until
to-morrow evening.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Leave him to me,&rdquo; cried Bobby Kane. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully good
at looking after people.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The gate swung open and shut. William moved on the terrace; they had seen him.
&ldquo;Hallo, William!&rdquo; And Bobby Kane, flapping his towel, began to leap
and pirouette on the parched lawn. &ldquo;Pity you didn&rsquo;t come, William.
The water was divine. And we all went to a little pub afterwards and had sloe
gin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The others had reached the house. &ldquo;I say, Isabel,&rdquo; called Bobby,
&ldquo;would you like me to wear my Nijinsky dress to-night?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Isabel, &ldquo;nobody&rsquo;s going to dress.
We&rsquo;re all starving. William&rsquo;s starving, too. Come along, <i>mes
amis</i>, let&rsquo;s begin with sardines.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found the sardines,&rdquo; said Moira, and she ran into the
hall, holding a box high in the air.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A Lady with a Box of Sardines,&rdquo; said Dennis gravely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, William, and how&rsquo;s London?&rdquo; asked Bill Hunt, drawing
the cork out of a bottle of whisky.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, London&rsquo;s not much changed,&rdquo; answered William.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good old London,&rdquo; said Bobby, very hearty, spearing a sardine.
</p>

<p>
But a moment later William was forgotten. Moira Morrison began wondering what
colour one&rsquo;s legs really were under water.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mine are the palest, palest mushroom colour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Bill and Dennis ate enormously. And Isabel filled glasses, and changed plates,
and found matches, smiling blissfully. At one moment, she said, &ldquo;I do
wish, Bill, you&rsquo;d paint it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Paint what?&rdquo; said Bill loudly, stuffing his mouth with bread.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Us,&rdquo; said Isabel, &ldquo;round the table. It would be so
fascinating in twenty years&rsquo; time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Bill screwed up his eyes and chewed. &ldquo;Light&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; he said
rudely, &ldquo;far too much yellow&rdquo;; and went on eating. And that seemed
to charm Isabel, too.
</p>

<p>
But after supper they were all so tired they could do nothing but yawn until it
was late enough to go to bed....
</p>

<p>
It was not until William was waiting for his taxi the next afternoon that he
found himself alone with Isabel. When he brought his suit-case down into the
hall, Isabel left the others and went over to him. She stooped down and picked
up the suit-case. &ldquo;What a weight!&rdquo; she said, and she gave a little
awkward laugh. &ldquo;Let me carry it! To the gate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, why should you?&rdquo; said William. &ldquo;Of course, not. Give it
to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, please, do let me,&rdquo; said Isabel. &ldquo;I want to,
really.&rdquo; They walked together silently. William felt there was nothing to
say now.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Isabel triumphantly, setting the suit-case down, and
she looked anxiously along the sandy road. &ldquo;I hardly seem to have seen
you this time,&rdquo; she said breathlessly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so short,
isn&rsquo;t it? I feel you&rsquo;ve only just come. Next time&mdash;&rdquo; The
taxi came into sight. &ldquo;I hope they look after you properly in London.
I&rsquo;m so sorry the babies have been out all day, but Miss Neil had arranged
it. They&rsquo;ll hate missing you. Poor William, going back to London.&rdquo;
The taxi turned. &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; She gave him a little hurried kiss;
she was gone.
</p>

<p>
Fields, trees, hedges streamed by. They shook through the empty, blind-looking
little town, ground up the steep pull to the station.
</p>

<p>
The train was in. William made straight for a first-class smoker, flung back
into the corner, but this time he let the papers alone. He folded his arms
against the dull, persistent gnawing, and began in his mind to write a letter
to Isabel.
</p>

<p>
<br /><br />
</p>

<hr />

<p>
<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
The post was late as usual. They sat outside the house in long chairs under
coloured parasols. Only Bobby Kane lay on the turf at Isabel&rsquo;s feet. It
was dull, stifling; the day drooped like a flag.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think there will be Mondays in Heaven?&rdquo; asked Bobby
childishly.
</p>

<p>
And Dennis murmured, &ldquo;Heaven will be one long Monday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Isabel couldn&rsquo;t help wondering what had happened to the salmon they
had for supper last night. She had meant to have fish mayonnaise for lunch and
now....
</p>

<p>
Moira was asleep. Sleeping was her latest discovery. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
<i>so</i> wonderful. One simply shuts one&rsquo;s eyes, that&rsquo;s all.
It&rsquo;s <i>so</i> delicious.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When the old ruddy postman came beating along the sandy road on his tricycle
one felt the handle-bars ought to have been oars.
</p>

<p>
Bill Hunt put down his book. &ldquo;Letters,&rdquo; he said complacently, and
they all waited. But, heartless postman&mdash;O malignant world! There was only
one, a fat one for Isabel. Not even a paper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And mine&rsquo;s only from William,&rdquo; said Isabel mournfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;From William&mdash;already?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sending you back your marriage lines as a gentle
reminder.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does everybody have marriage lines? I thought they were only for
servants.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pages and pages! Look at her! A Lady reading a Letter,&rdquo; said
Dennis.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>My darling, precious Isabel</i>.&rdquo; Pages and pages there were.
As Isabel read on her feeling of astonishment changed to a stifled feeling.
What on earth had induced William...? How extraordinary it was.... What could
have made him...? She felt confused, more and more excited, even frightened.
It was just like William. Was it? It was absurd, of course, it must be absurd,
ridiculous. &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha! Oh dear!&rdquo; What was she to do? Isabel flung
back in her chair and laughed till she couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do, do tell us,&rdquo; said the others. &ldquo;You must tell us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m longing to,&rdquo; gurgled Isabel. She sat up, gathered the
letter, and waved it at them. &ldquo;Gather round,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Listen, it&rsquo;s too marvellous. A love-letter!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A love-letter! But how divine!&rdquo; <i>Darling, precious Isabel.</i>
But she had hardly begun before their laughter interrupted her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on, Isabel, it&rsquo;s perfect.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most marvellous find.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, do go on, Isabel!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<i>God forbid, my darling, that I should be a drag on your happiness.</i>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! oh! oh!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sh! sh! sh!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Isabel went on. When she reached the end they were hysterical: Bobby rolled
on the turf and almost sobbed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must let me have it just as it is, entire, for my new book,&rdquo;
said Dennis firmly. &ldquo;I shall give it a whole chapter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Isabel,&rdquo; moaned Moira, &ldquo;that wonderful bit about holding
you in his arms!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I always thought those letters in divorce cases were made up. But they
pale before this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me hold it. Let me read it, mine own self,&rdquo; said Bobby Kane.
</p>

<p>
But, to their surprise, Isabel crushed the letter in her hand. She was laughing
no longer. She glanced quickly at them all; she looked exhausted. &ldquo;No,
not just now. Not just now,&rdquo; she stammered.
</p>

<p>
And before they could recover she had run into the house, through the hall, up
the stairs into her bedroom. Down she sat on the side of the bed. &ldquo;How
vile, odious, abominable, vulgar,&rdquo; muttered Isabel. She pressed her eyes
with her knuckles and rocked to and fro. And again she saw them, but not four,
more like forty, laughing, sneering, jeering, stretching out their hands while
she read them William&rsquo;s letter. Oh, what a loathsome thing to have done.
How could she have done it! <i>God forbid, my darling, that I should be a drag
on your happiness.</i> William! Isabel pressed her face into the pillow. But
she felt that even the grave bedroom knew her for what she was, shallow,
tinkling, vain....
</p>

<p>
Presently from the garden below there came voices.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isabel, we&rsquo;re all going for a bathe. Do come!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, thou wife of William!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Call her once before you go, call once yet!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Isabel sat up. Now was the moment, now she must decide. Would she go with them,
or stay here and write to William. Which, which should it be? &ldquo;I must
make up my mind.&rdquo; Oh, but how could there be any question? Of course she
would stay here and write.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Titania!&rdquo; piped Moira.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isa-bel?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
No, it was too difficult. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go with them, and
write to William later. Some other time. Later. Not now. But I shall
<i>certainly</i> write,&rdquo; thought Isabel hurriedly.
</p>

<p>
And, laughing, in the new way, she ran down the stairs.
</p>

<p><a name="chap08"></a></p> <h2>The Voyage</h2>

<p>
The Picton boat was due to leave at half-past eleven. It was a beautiful night,
mild, starry, only when they got out of the cab and started to walk down the
Old Wharf that jutted out into the harbour, a faint wind blowing off the water
ruffled under Fenella&rsquo;s hat, and she put up her hand to keep it on. It
was dark on the Old Wharf, very dark; the wool sheds, the cattle trucks, the
cranes standing up so high, the little squat railway engine, all seemed carved
out of solid darkness. Here and there on a rounded wood-pile, that was like the
stalk of a huge black mushroom, there hung a lantern, but it seemed afraid to
unfurl its timid, quivering light in all that blackness; it burned softly, as
if for itself.
</p>

<p>
Fenella&rsquo;s father pushed on with quick, nervous strides. Beside him her
grandma bustled along in her crackling black ulster; they went so fast that she
had now and again to give an undignified little skip to keep up with them. As
well as her luggage strapped into a neat sausage, Fenella carried clasped to
her her grandma&rsquo;s umbrella, and the handle, which was a swan&rsquo;s
head, kept giving her shoulder a sharp little peck as if it too wanted her to
hurry.... Men, their caps pulled down, their collars turned up, swung by; a few
women all muffled scurried along; and one tiny boy, only his little black arms
and legs showing out of a white woolly shawl, was jerked along angrily between
his father and mother; he looked like a baby fly that had fallen into the
cream.
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly, so suddenly that Fenella and her grandma both leapt, there
sounded from behind the largest wool shed, that had a trail of smoke hanging
over it, &ldquo;<i>Mia-oo-oo-O-O!</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;First whistle,&rdquo; said her father briefly, and at that moment they
came in sight of the Picton boat. Lying beside the dark wharf, all strung, all
beaded with round golden lights, the Picton boat looked as if she was more
ready to sail among stars than out into the cold sea. People pressed along the
gangway. First went her grandma, then her father, then Fenella. There was a
high step down on to the deck, and an old sailor in a jersey standing by gave
her his dry, hard hand. They were there; they stepped out of the way of the
hurrying people, and standing under a little iron stairway that led to the
upper deck they began to say good-bye.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There, mother, there&rsquo;s your luggage!&rdquo; said Fenella&rsquo;s
father, giving grandma another strapped-up sausage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, Frank.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve got your cabin tickets safe?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And your other tickets?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Grandma felt for them inside her glove and showed him the tips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He sounded stern, but Fenella, eagerly watching him, saw that he looked tired
and sad. &ldquo;<i>Mia-oo-oo-O-O!</i>&rdquo; The second whistle blared just
above their heads, and a voice like a cry shouted, &ldquo;Any more for the
gangway?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll give my love to father,&rdquo; Fenella saw her
father&rsquo;s lips say. And her grandma, very agitated, answered, &ldquo;Of
course I will, dear. Go now. You&rsquo;ll be left. Go now, Frank. Go
now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, mother. I&rsquo;ve got another three
minutes.&rdquo; To her surprise Fenella saw her father take off his hat. He
clasped grandma in his arms and pressed her to him. &ldquo;God bless you,
mother!&rdquo; she heard him say.
</p>

<p>
And grandma put her hand, with the black thread glove that was worn through on
her ring finger, against his cheek, and she sobbed, &ldquo;God bless you, my
own brave son!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was so awful that Fenella quickly turned her back on them, swallowed once,
twice, and frowned terribly at a little green star on a mast head. But she had
to turn round again; her father was going.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-bye, Fenella. Be a good girl.&rdquo; His cold, wet moustache
brushed her cheek. But Fenella caught hold of the lapels of his coat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How long am I going to stay?&rdquo; she whispered anxiously. He
wouldn&rsquo;t look at her. He shook her off gently, and gently said,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that. Here! Where&rsquo;s your hand?&rdquo; He
pressed something into her palm. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a shilling in case you
should need it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A shilling! She must be going away for ever! &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; cried
Fenella. But he was gone. He was the last off the ship. The sailors put their
shoulders to the gangway. A huge coil of dark rope went flying through the air
and fell &ldquo;thump&rdquo; on the wharf. A bell rang; a whistle shrilled.
Silently the dark wharf began to slip, to slide, to edge away from them. Now
there was a rush of water between. Fenella strained to see with all her might.
&ldquo;Was that father turning round?&rdquo;&mdash;or waving?&mdash;or standing
alone?&mdash;or walking off by himself? The strip of water grew broader,
darker. Now the Picton boat began to swing round steady, pointing out to sea.
It was no good looking any longer. There was nothing to be seen but a few
lights, the face of the town clock hanging in the air, and more lights, little
patches of them, on the dark hills.
</p>

<p>
The freshening wind tugged at Fenella&rsquo;s skirts; she went back to her
grandma. To her relief grandma seemed no longer sad. She had put the two
sausages of luggage one on top of the other, and she was sitting on them, her
hands folded, her head a little on one side. There was an intent, bright look
on her face. Then Fenella saw that her lips were moving and guessed that she
was praying. But the old woman gave her a bright nod as if to say the prayer
was nearly over. She unclasped her hands, sighed, clasped them again, bent
forward, and at last gave herself a soft shake.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And now, child,&rdquo; she said, fingering the bow of her
bonnet-strings, &ldquo;I think we ought to see about our cabins. Keep close to
me, and mind you don&rsquo;t slip.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, grandma!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And be careful the umbrellas aren&rsquo;t caught in the stair rail. I
saw a beautiful umbrella broken in half like that on my way over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, grandma.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dark figures of men lounged against the rails. In the glow of their pipes a
nose shone out, or the peak of a cap, or a pair of surprised-looking eyebrows.
Fenella glanced up. High in the air, a little figure, his hands thrust in his
short jacket pockets, stood staring out to sea. The ship rocked ever so little,
and she thought the stars rocked too. And now a pale steward in a linen coat,
holding a tray high in the palm of his hand, stepped out of a lighted doorway
and skimmed past them. They went through that doorway. Carefully over the high
brass-bound step on to the rubber mat and then down such a terribly steep
flight of stairs that grandma had to put both feet on each step, and Fenella
clutched the clammy brass rail and forgot all about the swan-necked umbrella.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom grandma stopped; Fenella was rather afraid she was going to pray
again. But no, it was only to get out the cabin tickets. They were in the
saloon. It was glaring bright and stifling; the air smelled of paint and burnt
chop-bones and indiarubber. Fenella wished her grandma would go on, but the old
woman was not to be hurried. An immense basket of ham sandwiches caught her
eye. She went up to them and touched the top one delicately with her finger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How much are the sandwiches?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tuppence!&rdquo; bawled a rude steward, slamming down a knife and fork.
</p>

<p>
Grandma could hardly believe it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Twopence <i>each</i>?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said the steward, and he winked at his
companion.
</p>

<p>
Grandma made a small, astonished face. Then she whispered primly to Fenella.
&ldquo;What wickedness!&rdquo; And they sailed out at the further door and
along a passage that had cabins on either side. Such a very nice stewardess
came to meet them. She was dressed all in blue, and her collar and cuffs were
fastened with large brass buttons. She seemed to know grandma well.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Mrs. Crane,&rdquo; said she, unlocking their washstand.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got you back again. It&rsquo;s not often you give yourself a
cabin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said grandma. &ldquo;But this time my dear son&rsquo;s
thoughtfulness&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope&mdash;&rdquo; began the stewardess. Then she turned round and
took a long, mournful look at grandma&rsquo;s blackness and at Fenella&rsquo;s
black coat and skirt, black blouse, and hat with a crape rose.
</p>

<p>
Grandma nodded. &ldquo;It was God&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; said she.
</p>

<p>
The stewardess shut her lips and, taking a deep breath, she seemed to expand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What I always say is,&rdquo; she said, as though it was her own
discovery, &ldquo;sooner or later each of us has to go, and that&rsquo;s a
certingty.&rdquo; She paused. &ldquo;Now, can I bring you anything, Mrs Crane?
A cup of tea? I know it&rsquo;s no good offering you a little something to keep
the cold out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Grandma shook her head. &ldquo;Nothing, thank you. We&rsquo;ve got a few wine
biscuits, and Fenella has a very nice banana.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll give you a look later on,&rdquo; said the stewardess,
and she went out, shutting the door.
</p>

<p>
What a very small cabin it was! It was like being shut up in a box with
grandma. The dark round eye above the washstand gleamed at them dully. Fenella
felt shy. She stood against the door, still clasping her luggage and the
umbrella. Were they going to get undressed in here? Already her grandma had
taken off her bonnet, and, rolling up the strings, she fixed each with a pin to
the lining before she hung the bonnet up. Her white hair shone like silk; the
little bun at the back was covered with a black net. Fenella hardly ever saw
her grandma with her head uncovered; she looked strange.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall put on the woollen fascinator your dear mother crocheted for
me,&rdquo; said grandma, and, unstrapping the sausage, she took it out and
wound it round her head; the fringe of grey bobbles danced at her eyebrows as
she smiled tenderly and mournfully at Fenella. Then she undid her bodice, and
something under that, and something else underneath that. Then there seemed a
short, sharp tussle, and grandma flushed faintly. Snip! Snap! She had undone
her stays. She breathed a sigh of relief, and sitting on the plush couch, she
slowly and carefully pulled off her elastic-sided boots and stood them side by
side.
</p>

<p>
By the time Fenella had taken off her coat and skirt and put on her flannel
dressing-gown grandma was quite ready.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Must I take off my boots, grandma? They&rsquo;re lace.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Grandma gave them a moment&rsquo;s deep consideration. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d feel
a great deal more comfortable if you did, child,&rdquo; said she. She kissed
Fenella. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to say your prayers. Our dear Lord is with
us when we are at sea even more than when we are on dry land. And because I am
an experienced traveller,&rdquo; said grandma briskly, &ldquo;I shall take the
upper berth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, grandma, however will you get up there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Three little spider-like steps were all Fenella saw. The old woman gave a small
silent laugh before she mounted them nimbly, and she peered over the high bunk
at the astonished Fenella.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think your grandma could do that, did you?&rdquo; said
she. And as she sank back Fenella heard her light laugh again.
</p>

<p>
The hard square of brown soap would not lather, and the water in the bottle was
like a kind of blue jelly. How hard it was, too, to turn down those stiff
sheets; you simply had to tear your way in. If everything had been different,
Fenella might have got the giggles.... At last she was inside, and while she
lay there panting, there sounded from above a long, soft whispering, as though
some one was gently, gently rustling among tissue paper to find something. It
was grandma saying her prayers....
</p>

<p>
A long time passed. Then the stewardess came in; she trod softly and leaned her
hand on grandma&rsquo;s bunk.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just entering the Straits,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine night, but we&rsquo;re rather empty. We may pitch a
little.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And indeed at that moment the Picton Boat rose and rose and hung in the air
just long enough to give a shiver before she swung down again, and there was
the sound of heavy water slapping against her sides. Fenella remembered she had
left the swan-necked umbrella standing up on the little couch. If it fell over,
would it break? But grandma remembered too, at the same time.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder if you&rsquo;d mind, stewardess, laying down my
umbrella,&rdquo; she whispered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not at all, Mrs. Crane.&rdquo; And the stewardess, coming back to
grandma, breathed, &ldquo;Your little granddaughter&rsquo;s in such a beautiful
sleep.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;God be praised for that!&rdquo; said grandma.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor little motherless mite!&rdquo; said the stewardess. And grandma was
still telling the stewardess all about what happened when Fenella fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
But she hadn&rsquo;t been asleep long enough to dream before she woke up again
to see something waving in the air above her head. What was it? What could it
be? It was a small grey foot. Now another joined it. They seemed to be feeling
about for something; there came a sigh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awake, grandma,&rdquo; said Fenella.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, dear, am I near the ladder?&rdquo; asked grandma. &ldquo;I thought
it was this end.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, grandma, it&rsquo;s the other. I&rsquo;ll put your foot on it. Are
we there?&rdquo; asked Fenella.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the harbour,&rdquo; said grandma. &ldquo;We must get up, child.
You&rsquo;d better have a biscuit to steady yourself before you move.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Fenella had hopped out of her bunk. The lamp was still burning, but night
was over, and it was cold. Peering through that round eye she could see far off
some rocks. Now they were scattered over with foam; now a gull flipped by; and
now there came a long piece of real land.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s land, grandma,&rdquo; said Fenella, wonderingly, as though
they had been at sea for weeks together. She hugged herself; she stood on one
leg and rubbed it with the toes of the other foot; she was trembling. Oh, it
had all been so sad lately. Was it going to change? But all her grandma said
was, &ldquo;Make haste, child. I should leave your nice banana for the
stewardess as you haven&rsquo;t eaten it.&rdquo; And Fenella put on her black
clothes again and a button sprang off one of her gloves and rolled to where she
couldn&rsquo;t reach it. They went up on deck.
</p>

<p>
But if it had been cold in the cabin, on deck it was like ice. The sun was not
up yet, but the stars were dim, and the cold pale sky was the same colour as
the cold pale sea. On the land a white mist rose and fell. Now they could see
quite plainly dark bush. Even the shapes of the umbrella ferns showed, and
those strange silvery withered trees that are like skeletons.... Now they could
see the landing-stage and some little houses, pale too, clustered together,
like shells on the lid of a box. The other passengers tramped up and down, but
more slowly than they had the night before, and they looked gloomy.
</p>

<p>
And now the landing-stage came out to meet them. Slowly it swam towards the
Picton boat, and a man holding a coil of rope, and a cart with a small drooping
horse and another man sitting on the step, came too.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Penreddy, Fenella, come for us,&rdquo; said grandma. She
sounded pleased. Her white waxen cheeks were blue with cold, her chin trembled,
and she had to keep wiping her eyes and her little pink nose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got my&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, grandma.&rdquo; Fenella showed it to her.
</p>

<p>
The rope came flying through the air, and &ldquo;smack&rdquo; it fell on to the
deck. The gangway was lowered. Again Fenella followed her grandma on to the
wharf over to the little cart, and a moment later they were bowling away. The
hooves of the little horse drummed over the wooden piles, then sank softly into
the sandy road. Not a soul was to be seen; there was not even a feather of
smoke. The mist rose and fell and the sea still sounded asleep as slowly it
turned on the beach.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I seen Mr. Crane yestiddy,&rdquo; said Mr. Penreddy. &ldquo;He looked
himself then. Missus knocked him up a batch of scones last week.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And now the little horse pulled up before one of the shell-like houses. They
got down. Fenella put her hand on the gate, and the big, trembling dew-drops
soaked through her glove-tips. Up a little path of round white pebbles they
went, with drenched sleeping flowers on either side. Grandma&rsquo;s delicate
white picotees were so heavy with dew that they were fallen, but their sweet
smell was part of the cold morning. The blinds were down in the little house;
they mounted the steps on to the veranda. A pair of old bluchers was on one
side of the door, and a large red watering-can on the other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tut! tut! Your grandpa,&rdquo; said grandma. She turned the handle. Not
a sound. She called, &ldquo;Walter!&rdquo; And immediately a deep voice that
sounded half stifled called back, &ldquo;Is that you, Mary?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wait, dear,&rdquo; said grandma. &ldquo;Go in there.&rdquo; She pushed
Fenella gently into a small dusky sitting-room.
</p>

<p>
On the table a white cat, that had been folded up like a camel, rose, stretched
itself, yawned, and then sprang on to the tips of its toes. Fenella buried one
cold little hand in the white, warm fur, and smiled timidly while she stroked
and listened to grandma&rsquo;s gentle voice and the rolling tones of grandpa.
</p>

<p>
A door creaked. &ldquo;Come in, dear.&rdquo; The old woman beckoned, Fenella
followed. There, lying to one side on an immense bed, lay grandpa. Just his
head with a white tuft and his rosy face and long silver beard showed over the
quilt. He was like a very old wide-awake bird.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, my girl!&rdquo; said grandpa. &ldquo;Give us a kiss!&rdquo;
Fenella kissed him. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; said grandpa. &ldquo;Her little nose is
as cold as a button. What&rsquo;s that she&rsquo;s holding? Her grandma&rsquo;s
umbrella?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fenella smiled again, and crooked the swan neck over the bed-rail. Above the
bed there was a big text in a deep black frame:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
Lost! One Golden Hour<br />
Set with Sixty Diamond Minutes.<br />
No Reward Is Offered<br />
For It Is Gone For Ever!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yer grandma painted that,&rdquo; said grandpa. And he ruffled his white
tuft and looked at Fenella so merrily she almost thought he winked at her.
</p>

<p>
<br /><br /><br /><br />
</p>

<p><a name="chap09"></a></p> <h2>Miss Brill</h2>

<p>
Although it was so brilliantly fine&mdash;the blue sky powdered with gold and
great spots of light like white wine splashed over the Jardins
Publiques&mdash;Miss Brill was glad that she had decided on her fur. The air
was motionless, but when you opened your mouth there was just a faint chill,
like a chill from a glass of iced water before you sip, and now and again a
leaf came drifting&mdash;from nowhere, from the sky. Miss Brill put up her hand
and touched her fur. Dear little thing! It was nice to feel it again. She had
taken it out of its box that afternoon, shaken out the moth-powder, given it a
good brush, and rubbed the life back into the dim little eyes. &ldquo;What has
been happening to me?&rdquo; said the sad little eyes. Oh, how sweet it was to
see them snap at her again from the red eiderdown!... But the nose, which was
of some black composition, wasn&rsquo;t at all firm. It must have had a knock,
somehow. Never mind&mdash;a little dab of black sealing-wax when the time
came&mdash;when it was absolutely necessary.... Little rogue! Yes, she really
felt like that about it. Little rogue biting its tail just by her left ear. She
could have taken it off and laid it on her lap and stroked it. She felt a
tingling in her hands and arms, but that came from walking, she supposed. And
when she breathed, something light and sad&mdash;no, not sad,
exactly&mdash;something gentle seemed to move in her bosom.
</p>

<p>
There were a number of people out this afternoon, far more than last Sunday.
And the band sounded louder and gayer. That was because the Season had begun.
For although the band played all the year round on Sundays, out of season it
was never the same. It was like some one playing with only the family to
listen; it didn&rsquo;t care how it played if there weren&rsquo;t any strangers
present. Wasn&rsquo;t the conductor wearing a new coat, too? She was sure it
was new. He scraped with his foot and flapped his arms like a rooster about to
crow, and the bandsmen sitting in the green rotunda blew out their cheeks and
glared at the music. Now there came a little &ldquo;flutey&rdquo;
bit&mdash;very pretty!&mdash;a little chain of bright drops. She was sure it
would be repeated. It was; she lifted her head and smiled.
</p>

<p>
Only two people shared her &ldquo;special&rdquo; seat: a fine old man in a
velvet coat, his hands clasped over a huge carved walking-stick, and a big old
woman, sitting upright, with a roll of knitting on her embroidered apron. They
did not speak. This was disappointing, for Miss Brill always looked forward to
the conversation. She had become really quite expert, she thought, at listening
as though she didn&rsquo;t listen, at sitting in other people&rsquo;s lives
just for a minute while they talked round her.
</p>

<p>
She glanced, sideways, at the old couple. Perhaps they would go soon. Last
Sunday, too, hadn&rsquo;t been as interesting as usual. An Englishman and his
wife, he wearing a dreadful Panama hat and she button boots. And she&rsquo;d
gone on the whole time about how she ought to wear spectacles; she knew she
needed them; but that it was no good getting any; they&rsquo;d be sure to break
and they&rsquo;d never keep on. And he&rsquo;d been so patient. He&rsquo;d
suggested everything&mdash;gold rims, the kind that curved round your ears,
little pads inside the bridge. No, nothing would please her.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll always be sliding down my nose!&rdquo; Miss Brill had
wanted to shake her.
</p>

<p>
The old people sat on the bench, still as statues. Never mind, there was always
the crowd to watch. To and fro, in front of the flower-beds and the band
rotunda, the couples and groups paraded, stopped to talk, to greet, to buy a
handful of flowers from the old beggar who had his tray fixed to the railings.
Little children ran among them, swooping and laughing; little boys with big
white silk bows under their chins, little girls, little French dolls, dressed
up in velvet and lace. And sometimes a tiny staggerer came suddenly rocking
into the open from under the trees, stopped, stared, as suddenly sat down
&ldquo;flop,&rdquo; until its small high-stepping mother, like a young hen,
rushed scolding to its rescue. Other people sat on the benches and green
chairs, but they were nearly always the same, Sunday after Sunday,
and&mdash;Miss Brill had often noticed&mdash;there was something funny about
nearly all of them. They were odd, silent, nearly all old, and from the way
they stared they looked as though they&rsquo;d just come from dark little rooms
or even&mdash;even cupboards!
</p>

<p>
Behind the rotunda the slender trees with yellow leaves down drooping, and
through them just a line of sea, and beyond the blue sky with gold-veined
clouds.
</p>

<p>
Tum-tum-tum tiddle-um! tiddle-um! tum tiddley-um tum ta! blew the band.
</p>

<p>
Two young girls in red came by and two young soldiers in blue met them, and
they laughed and paired and went off arm-in-arm. Two peasant women with funny
straw hats passed, gravely, leading beautiful smoke-coloured donkeys. A cold,
pale nun hurried by. A beautiful woman came along and dropped her bunch of
violets, and a little boy ran after to hand them to her, and she took them and
threw them away as if they&rsquo;d been poisoned. Dear me! Miss Brill
didn&rsquo;t know whether to admire that or not! And now an ermine toque and a
gentleman in grey met just in front of her. He was tall, stiff, dignified, and
she was wearing the ermine toque she&rsquo;d bought when her hair was yellow.
Now everything, her hair, her face, even her eyes, was the same colour as the
shabby ermine, and her hand, in its cleaned glove, lifted to dab her lips, was
a tiny yellowish paw. Oh, she was so pleased to see him&mdash;delighted! She
rather thought they were going to meet that afternoon. She described where
she&rsquo;d been&mdash;everywhere, here, there, along by the sea. The day was
so charming&mdash;didn&rsquo;t he agree? And wouldn&rsquo;t he, perhaps?... But
he shook his head, lighted a cigarette, slowly breathed a great deep puff into
her face, and even while she was still talking and laughing, flicked the match
away and walked on. The ermine toque was alone; she smiled more brightly than
ever. But even the band seemed to know what she was feeling and played more
softly, played tenderly, and the drum beat, &ldquo;The Brute! The Brute!&rdquo;
over and over. What would she do? What was going to happen now? But as Miss
Brill wondered, the ermine toque turned, raised her hand as though she&rsquo;d
seen some one else, much nicer, just over there, and pattered away. And the
band changed again and played more quickly, more gayly than ever, and the old
couple on Miss Brill&rsquo;s seat got up and marched away, and such a funny old
man with long whiskers hobbled along in time to the music and was nearly
knocked over by four girls walking abreast.
</p>

<p>
Oh, how fascinating it was! How she enjoyed it! How she loved sitting here,
watching it all! It was like a play. It was exactly like a play. Who could
believe the sky at the back wasn&rsquo;t painted? But it wasn&rsquo;t till a
little brown dog trotted on solemn and then slowly trotted off, like a little
&ldquo;theatre&rdquo; dog, a little dog that had been drugged, that Miss Brill
discovered what it was that made it so exciting. They were all on the stage.
They weren&rsquo;t only the audience, not only looking on; they were acting.
Even she had a part and came every Sunday. No doubt somebody would have noticed
if she hadn&rsquo;t been there; she was part of the performance after all. How
strange she&rsquo;d never thought of it like that before! And yet it explained
why she made such a point of starting from home at just the same time each
week&mdash;so as not to be late for the performance&mdash;and it also explained
why she had quite a queer, shy feeling at telling her English pupils how she
spent her Sunday afternoons. No wonder! Miss Brill nearly laughed out loud. She
was on the stage. She thought of the old invalid gentleman to whom she read the
newspaper four afternoons a week while he slept in the garden. She had got
quite used to the frail head on the cotton pillow, the hollowed eyes, the open
mouth and the high pinched nose. If he&rsquo;d been dead she mightn&rsquo;t
have noticed for weeks; she wouldn&rsquo;t have minded. But suddenly he knew he
was having the paper read to him by an actress! &ldquo;An actress!&rdquo; The
old head lifted; two points of light quivered in the old eyes. &ldquo;An
actress&mdash;are ye?&rdquo; And Miss Brill smoothed the newspaper as though it
were the manuscript of her part and said gently; &ldquo;Yes, I have been an
actress for a long time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The band had been having a rest. Now they started again. And what they played
was warm, sunny, yet there was just a faint chill&mdash;a something, what was
it?&mdash;not sadness&mdash;no, not sadness&mdash;a something that made you
want to sing. The tune lifted, lifted, the light shone; and it seemed to Miss
Brill that in another moment all of them, all the whole company, would begin
singing. The young ones, the laughing ones who were moving together, they would
begin, and the men&rsquo;s voices, very resolute and brave, would join them.
And then she too, she too, and the others on the benches&mdash;they would come
in with a kind of accompaniment&mdash;something low, that scarcely rose or
fell, something so beautiful&mdash;moving.... And Miss Brill&rsquo;s eyes
filled with tears and she looked smiling at all the other members of the
company. Yes, we understand, we understand, she thought&mdash;though what they
understood she didn&rsquo;t know.
</p>

<p>
Just at that moment a boy and girl came and sat down where the old couple had
been. They were beautifully dressed; they were in love. The hero and heroine,
of course, just arrived from his father&rsquo;s yacht. And still soundlessly
singing, still with that trembling smile, Miss Brill prepared to listen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, not now,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Not here, I
can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why? Because of that stupid old thing at the end there?&rdquo; asked
the boy. &ldquo;Why does she come here at all&mdash;who wants her? Why
doesn&rsquo;t she keep her silly old mug at home?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her fu-fur which is so funny,&rdquo; giggled the girl.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s exactly like a fried whiting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, be off with you!&rdquo; said the boy in an angry whisper. Then:
&ldquo;Tell me, ma petite chère&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, not here,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Not <i>yet</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<br /><br />
</p>

<hr />

<p>
<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
On her way home she usually bought a slice of honey-cake at the baker&rsquo;s.
It was her Sunday treat. Sometimes there was an almond in her slice, sometimes
not. It made a great difference. If there was an almond it was like carrying
home a tiny present&mdash;a surprise&mdash;something that might very well not
have been there. She hurried on the almond Sundays and struck the match for the
kettle in quite a dashing way.
</p>

<p>
But to-day she passed the baker&rsquo;s by, climbed the stairs, went into the
little dark room&mdash;her room like a cupboard&mdash;and sat down on the red
eiderdown. She sat there for a long time. The box that the fur came out of was
on the bed. She unclasped the necklet quickly; quickly, without looking, laid
it inside. But when she put the lid on she thought she heard something crying.
</p>

<p>

<p><a name="chap10"></a></p> <h2>Her First Ball</h2>

<p>
Exactly when the ball began Leila would have found it hard to say. Perhaps her
first real partner was the cab. It did not matter that she shared the cab with
the Sheridan girls and their brother. She sat back in her own little corner of
it, and the bolster on which her hand rested felt like the sleeve of an unknown
young man&rsquo;s dress suit; and away they bowled, past waltzing lamp-posts
and houses and fences and trees.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you really never been to a ball before, Leila? But, my child, how
too weird&mdash;&rdquo; cried the Sheridan girls.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Our nearest neighbour was fifteen miles,&rdquo; said Leila softly,
gently opening and shutting her fan.
</p>

<p>
Oh dear, how hard it was to be indifferent like the others! She tried not to
smile too much; she tried not to care. But every single thing was so new and
exciting... Meg&rsquo;s tuberoses, Jose&rsquo;s long loop of amber,
Laura&rsquo;s little dark head, pushing above her white fur like a flower
through snow. She would remember for ever. It even gave her a pang to see her
cousin Laurie throw away the wisps of tissue paper he pulled from the
fastenings of his new gloves. She would like to have kept those wisps as a
keepsake, as a remembrance. Laurie leaned forward and put his hand on
Laura&rsquo;s knee.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, darling,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The third and the ninth as
usual. Twig?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oh, how marvellous to have a brother! In her excitement Leila felt that if
there had been time, if it hadn&rsquo;t been impossible, she couldn&rsquo;t
have helped crying because she was an only child, and no brother had ever said
&ldquo;Twig?&rdquo; to her; no sister would ever say, as Meg said to Jose that
moment, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never known your hair go up more successfully than it
has to-night!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But, of course, there was no time. They were at the drill hall already; there
were cabs in front of them and cabs behind. The road was bright on either side
with moving fan-like lights, and on the pavement gay couples seemed to float
through the air; little satin shoes chased each other like birds.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold on to me, Leila; you&rsquo;ll get lost,&rdquo; said Laura.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come on, girls, let&rsquo;s make a dash for it,&rdquo; said Laurie.
</p>

<p>
Leila put two fingers on Laura&rsquo;s pink velvet cloak, and they were somehow
lifted past the big golden lantern, carried along the passage, and pushed into
the little room marked &ldquo;Ladies.&rdquo; Here the crowd was so great there
was hardly space to take off their things; the noise was deafening. Two benches
on either side were stacked high with wraps. Two old women in white aprons ran
up and down tossing fresh armfuls. And everybody was pressing forward trying to
get at the little dressing-table and mirror at the far end.
</p>

<p>
A great quivering jet of gas lighted the ladies&rsquo; room. It couldn&rsquo;t
wait; it was dancing already. When the door opened again and there came a burst
of tuning from the drill hall, it leaped almost to the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
Dark girls, fair girls were patting their hair, tying ribbons again, tucking
handkerchiefs down the fronts of their bodices, smoothing marble-white gloves.
And because they were all laughing it seemed to Leila that they were all
lovely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t there any invisible hair-pins?&rdquo; cried a voice.
&ldquo;How most extraordinary! I can&rsquo;t see a single invisible
hair-pin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Powder my back, there&rsquo;s a darling,&rdquo; cried some one else.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I must have a needle and cotton. I&rsquo;ve torn simply miles and
miles of the frill,&rdquo; wailed a third.
</p>

<p>
Then, &ldquo;Pass them along, pass them along!&rdquo; The straw basket of
programmes was tossed from arm to arm. Darling little pink-and-silver
programmes, with pink pencils and fluffy tassels. Leila&rsquo;s fingers shook
as she took one out of the basket. She wanted to ask some one, &ldquo;Am I
meant to have one too?&rdquo; but she had just time to read: &ldquo;Waltz 3.
<i>Two, Two in a Canoe.</i> Polka 4. <i>Making the Feathers Fly</i>,&rdquo;
when Meg cried, &ldquo;Ready, Leila?&rdquo; and they pressed their way through
the crush in the passage towards the big double doors of the drill hall.
</p>

<p>
Dancing had not begun yet, but the band had stopped tuning, and the noise was
so great it seemed that when it did begin to play it would never be heard.
Leila, pressing close to Meg, looking over Meg&rsquo;s shoulder, felt that even
the little quivering coloured flags strung across the ceiling were talking. She
quite forgot to be shy; she forgot how in the middle of dressing she had sat
down on the bed with one shoe off and one shoe on and begged her mother to ring
up her cousins and say she couldn&rsquo;t go after all. And the rush of longing
she had had to be sitting on the veranda of their forsaken up-country home,
listening to the baby owls crying &ldquo;More pork&rdquo; in the moonlight, was
changed to a rush of joy so sweet that it was hard to bear alone. She clutched
her fan, and, gazing at the gleaming, golden floor, the azaleas, the lanterns,
the stage at one end with its red carpet and gilt chairs and the band in a
corner, she thought breathlessly, &ldquo;How heavenly; how simply
heavenly!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
All the girls stood grouped together at one side of the doors, the men at the
other, and the chaperones in dark dresses, smiling rather foolishly, walked
with little careful steps over the polished floor towards the stage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is my little country cousin Leila. Be nice to her. Find her
partners; she&rsquo;s under my wing,&rdquo; said Meg, going up to one girl
after another.
</p>

<p>
Strange faces smiled at Leila&mdash;sweetly, vaguely. Strange voices answered,
&ldquo;Of course, my dear.&rdquo; But Leila felt the girls didn&rsquo;t really
see her. They were looking towards the men. Why didn&rsquo;t the men begin?
What were they waiting for? There they stood, smoothing their gloves, patting
their glossy hair and smiling among themselves. Then, quite suddenly, as if
they had only just made up their minds that that was what they had to do, the
men came gliding over the parquet. There was a joyful flutter among the girls.
A tall, fair man flew up to Meg, seized her programme, scribbled something; Meg
passed him on to Leila. &ldquo;May I have the pleasure?&rdquo; He ducked and
smiled. There came a dark man wearing an eyeglass, then cousin Laurie with a
friend, and Laura with a little freckled fellow whose tie was crooked. Then
quite an old man&mdash;fat, with a big bald patch on his head&mdash;took her
programme and murmured, &ldquo;Let me see, let me see!&rdquo; And he was a long
time comparing his programme, which looked black with names, with hers. It
seemed to give him so much trouble that Leila was ashamed. &ldquo;Oh, please
don&rsquo;t bother,&rdquo; she said eagerly. But instead of replying the fat
man wrote something, glanced at her again. &ldquo;Do I remember this bright
little face?&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;Is it known to me of yore?&rdquo; At
that moment the band began playing; the fat man disappeared. He was tossed away
on a great wave of music that came flying over the gleaming floor, breaking the
groups up into couples, scattering them, sending them spinning....
</p>

<p>
Leila had learned to dance at boarding school. Every Saturday afternoon the
boarders were hurried off to a little corrugated iron mission hall where Miss
Eccles (of London) held her &ldquo;select&rdquo; classes. But the difference
between that dusty-smelling hall&mdash;with calico texts on the walls, the poor
terrified little woman in a brown velvet toque with rabbit&rsquo;s ears
thumping the cold piano, Miss Eccles poking the girls&rsquo; feet with her long
white wand&mdash;and this was so tremendous that Leila was sure if her partner
didn&rsquo;t come and she had to listen to that marvellous music and to watch
the others sliding, gliding over the golden floor, she would die at least, or
faint, or lift her arms and fly out of one of those dark windows that showed
the stars.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ours, I think&mdash;&rdquo; Some one bowed, smiled, and offered her his
arm; she hadn&rsquo;t to die after all. Some one&rsquo;s hand pressed her
waist, and she floated away like a flower that is tossed into a pool.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite a good floor, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; drawled a faint voice close
to her ear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s most beautifully slippery,&rdquo; said Leila.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pardon!&rdquo; The faint voice sounded surprised. Leila said it again.
And there was a tiny pause before the voice echoed, &ldquo;Oh, quite!&rdquo;
and she was swung round again.
</p>

<p>
He steered so beautifully. That was the great difference between dancing with
girls and men, Leila decided. Girls banged into each other, and stamped on each
other&rsquo;s feet; the girl who was gentleman always clutched you so.
</p>

<p>
The azaleas were separate flowers no longer; they were pink and white flags
streaming by.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Were you at the Bells&rsquo; last week?&rdquo; the voice came again. It
sounded tired. Leila wondered whether she ought to ask him if he would like to
stop.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, this is my first dance,&rdquo; said she.
</p>

<p>
Her partner gave a little gasping laugh. &ldquo;Oh, I say,&rdquo; he protested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it is really the first dance I&rsquo;ve ever been to.&rdquo; Leila
was most fervent. It was such a relief to be able to tell somebody. &ldquo;You
see, I&rsquo;ve lived in the country all my life up till now....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At that moment the music stopped, and they went to sit on two chairs against
the wall. Leila tucked her pink satin feet under and fanned herself, while she
blissfully watched the other couples passing and disappearing through the swing
doors.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Enjoying yourself, Leila?&rdquo; asked Jose, nodding her golden head.
</p>

<p>
Laura passed and gave her the faintest little wink; it made Leila wonder for a
moment whether she was quite grown up after all. Certainly her partner did not
say very much. He coughed, tucked his handkerchief away, pulled down his
waistcoat, took a minute thread off his sleeve. But it didn&rsquo;t matter.
Almost immediately the band started and her second partner seemed to spring
from the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Floor&rsquo;s not bad,&rdquo; said the new voice. Did one always begin
with the floor? And then, &ldquo;Were you at the Neaves&rsquo; on
Tuesday?&rdquo; And again Leila explained. Perhaps it was a little strange that
her partners were not more interested. For it was thrilling. Her first ball!
She was only at the beginning of everything. It seemed to her that she had
never known what the night was like before. Up till now it had been dark,
silent, beautiful very often&mdash;oh yes&mdash;but mournful somehow. Solemn.
And now it would never be like that again&mdash;it had opened dazzling bright.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Care for an ice?&rdquo; said her partner. And they went through the
swing doors, down the passage, to the supper room. Her cheeks burned, she was
fearfully thirsty. How sweet the ices looked on little glass plates and how
cold the frosted spoon was, iced too! And when they came back to the hall there
was the fat man waiting for her by the door. It gave her quite a shock again to
see how old he was; he ought to have been on the stage with the fathers and
mothers. And when Leila compared him with her other partners he looked shabby.
His waistcoat was creased, there was a button off his glove, his coat looked as
if it was dusty with French chalk.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come along, little lady,&rdquo; said the fat man. He scarcely troubled
to clasp her, and they moved away so gently, it was more like walking than
dancing. But he said not a word about the floor. &ldquo;Your first dance,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he murmured.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How <i>did</i> you know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the fat man, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what it is to be
old!&rdquo; He wheezed faintly as he steered her past an awkward couple.
&ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;ve been doing this kind of thing for the last thirty
years.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thirty years?&rdquo; cried Leila. Twelve years before she was born!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It hardly bears thinking about, does it?&rdquo; said the fat man
gloomily. Leila looked at his bald head, and she felt quite sorry for him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s marvellous to be still going on,&rdquo; she said
kindly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Kind little lady,&rdquo; said the fat man, and he pressed her a little
closer, and hummed a bar of the waltz. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;you can&rsquo;t hope to last anything like as long as that. No-o,&rdquo;
said the fat man, &ldquo;long before that you&rsquo;ll be sitting up there on
the stage, looking on, in your nice black velvet. And these pretty arms will
have turned into little short fat ones, and you&rsquo;ll beat time with such a
different kind of fan&mdash;a black bony one.&rdquo; The fat man seemed to
shudder. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll smile away like the poor old dears up there,
and point to your daughter, and tell the elderly lady next to you how some
dreadful man tried to kiss her at the club ball. And your heart will ache,
ache&rdquo;&mdash;the fat man squeezed her closer still, as if he really was
sorry for that poor heart&mdash;&ldquo;because no one wants to kiss you now.
And you&rsquo;ll say how unpleasant these polished floors are to walk on, how
dangerous they are. Eh, Mademoiselle Twinkletoes?&rdquo; said the fat man
softly.
</p>

<p>
Leila gave a light little laugh, but she did not feel like laughing. Was
it&mdash;could it all be true? It sounded terribly true. Was this first ball
only the beginning of her last ball, after all? At that the music seemed to
change; it sounded sad, sad; it rose upon a great sigh. Oh, how quickly things
changed! Why didn&rsquo;t happiness last for ever? For ever wasn&rsquo;t a bit
too long.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to stop,&rdquo; she said in a breathless voice. The fat man led
her to the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go outside. I won&rsquo;t sit
down. I&rsquo;ll just stand here, thank you.&rdquo; She leaned against the
wall, tapping with her foot, pulling up her gloves and trying to smile. But
deep inside her a little girl threw her pinafore over her head and sobbed. Why
had he spoiled it all?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, you know,&rdquo; said the fat man, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t take
me seriously, little lady.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As if I should!&rdquo; said Leila, tossing her small dark head and
sucking her underlip....
</p>

<p>
Again the couples paraded. The swing doors opened and shut. Now new music was
given out by the bandmaster. But Leila didn&rsquo;t want to dance any more. She
wanted to be home, or sitting on the veranda listening to those baby owls. When
she looked through the dark windows at the stars, they had long beams like
wings....
</p>

<p>
But presently a soft, melting, ravishing tune began, and a young man with curly
hair bowed before her. She would have to dance, out of politeness, until she
could find Meg. Very stiffly she walked into the middle; very haughtily she put
her hand on his sleeve. But in one minute, in one turn, her feet glided,
glided. The lights, the azaleas, the dresses, the pink faces, the velvet
chairs, all became one beautiful flying wheel. And when her next partner bumped
her into the fat man and he said, &ldquo;Par<i>don</i>,&rdquo; she smiled at
him more radiantly than ever. She didn&rsquo;t even recognize him again.
</p>

<p><a name="chap11"></a></p> <h2>The Singing Lesson</h2>

<p>
With despair&mdash;cold, sharp despair&mdash;buried deep in her heart like a
wicked knife, Miss Meadows, in cap and gown and carrying a little baton, trod
the cold corridors that led to the music hall. Girls of all ages, rosy from the
air, and bubbling over with that gleeful excitement that comes from running to
school on a fine autumn morning, hurried, skipped, fluttered by; from the
hollow class-rooms came a quick drumming of voices; a bell rang; a voice like a
bird cried, &ldquo;Muriel.&rdquo; And then there came from the staircase a
tremendous knock-knock-knocking. Some one had dropped her dumbbells.
</p>

<p>
The Science Mistress stopped Miss Meadows.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good mor-ning,&rdquo; she cried, in her sweet, affected drawl.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it cold? It might be win-ter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Meadows, hugging the knife, stared in hatred at the Science Mistress.
Everything about her was sweet, pale, like honey. You would not have been
surprised to see a bee caught in the tangles of that yellow hair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is rather sharp,&rdquo; said Miss Meadows, grimly.
</p>

<p>
The other smiled her sugary smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You look fro-zen,&rdquo; said she. Her blue eyes opened wide; there came
a mocking light in them. (Had she noticed anything?)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, not quite as bad as that,&rdquo; said Miss Meadows, and she gave the
Science Mistress, in exchange for her smile, a quick grimace and passed on....
</p>

<p>
Forms Four, Five, and Six were assembled in the music hall. The noise was
deafening. On the platform, by the piano, stood Mary Beazley, Miss
Meadows&rsquo; favourite, who played accompaniments. She was turning the music
stool. When she saw Miss Meadows she gave a loud, warning &ldquo;Sh-sh!
girls!&rdquo; and Miss Meadows, her hands thrust in her sleeves, the baton
under her arm, strode down the centre aisle, mounted the steps, turned sharply,
seized the brass music stand, planted it in front of her, and gave two sharp
taps with her baton for silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Silence, please! Immediately!&rdquo; and, looking at nobody, her glance
swept over that sea of coloured flannel blouses, with bobbing pink faces and
hands, quivering butterfly hair-bows, and music-books outspread. She knew
perfectly well what they were thinking. &ldquo;Meady is in a wax.&rdquo; Well,
let them think it! Her eyelids quivered; she tossed her head, defying them.
What could the thoughts of those creatures matter to some one who stood there
bleeding to death, pierced to the heart, to the heart, by such a letter&mdash;
</p>

<p>
... &ldquo;I feel more and more strongly that our marriage would be a mistake.
Not that I do not love you. I love you as much as it is possible for me to love
any woman, but, truth to tell, I have come to the conclusion that I am not a
marrying man, and the idea of settling down fills me with nothing
but&mdash;&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;disgust&rdquo; was scratched out lightly
and &ldquo;regret&rdquo; written over the top.
</p>

<p>
Basil! Miss Meadows stalked over to the piano. And Mary Beazley, who was
waiting for this moment, bent forward; her curls fell over her cheeks while she
breathed, &ldquo;Good morning, Miss Meadows,&rdquo; and she motioned towards
rather than handed to her mistress a beautiful yellow chrysanthemum. This
little ritual of the flower had been gone through for ages and ages, quite a
term and a half. It was as much part of the lesson as opening the piano. But
this morning, instead of taking it up, instead of tucking it into her belt
while she leant over Mary and said, &ldquo;Thank you, Mary. How very nice! Turn
to page thirty-two,&rdquo; what was Mary&rsquo;s horror when Miss Meadows
totally ignored the chrysanthemum, made no reply to her greeting, but said in a
voice of ice, &ldquo;Page fourteen, please, and mark the accents well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Staggering moment! Mary blushed until the tears stood in her eyes, but Miss
Meadows was gone back to the music stand; her voice rang through the music
hall.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Page fourteen. We will begin with page fourteen. &lsquo;A Lament.&rsquo;
Now, girls, you ought to know it by this time. We shall take it all together;
not in parts, all together. And without expression. Sing it, though, quite
simply, beating time with the left hand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She raised the baton; she tapped the music stand twice. Down came Mary on the
opening chord; down came all those left hands, beating the air, and in chimed
those young, mournful voices:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
Fast! Ah, too Fast Fade the Ro-o-ses of Pleasure;<br />
Soon Autumn yields unto Wi-i-nter Drear.<br />
Fleetly! Ah, Fleetly Mu-u-sic&rsquo;s Gay Measure<br />
Passes away from the Listening Ear.
</p>

<p>
Good Heavens, what could be more tragic than that lament! Every note was a
sigh, a sob, a groan of awful mournfulness. Miss Meadows lifted her arms in the
wide gown and began conducting with both hands. &ldquo;... I feel more and more
strongly that our marriage would be a mistake....&rdquo; she beat. And the
voices cried: <i>Fleetly! Ah, Fleetly.</i> What could have possessed him to
write such a letter! What could have led up to it! It came out of nothing. His
last letter had been all about a fumed-oak bookcase he had bought for
&ldquo;our&rdquo; books, and a &ldquo;natty little hall-stand&rdquo; he had
seen, &ldquo;a very neat affair with a carved owl on a bracket, holding three
hat-brushes in its claws.&rdquo; How she had smiled at that! So like a man to
think one needed three hat-brushes! <i>From the Listening Ear</i>, sang the
voices.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Once again,&rdquo; said Miss Meadows. &ldquo;But this time in parts.
Still without expression.&rdquo; <i>Fast! Ah, too Fast.</i> With the gloom of
the contraltos added, one could scarcely help shuddering. <i>Fade the Roses of
Pleasure.</i> Last time he had come to see her, Basil had worn a rose in his
buttonhole. How handsome he had looked in that bright blue suit, with that dark
red rose! And he knew it, too. He couldn&rsquo;t help knowing it. First he
stroked his hair, then his moustache; his teeth gleamed when he smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The headmaster&rsquo;s wife keeps on asking me to dinner. It&rsquo;s a
perfect nuisance. I never get an evening to myself in that place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But can&rsquo;t you refuse?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well, it doesn&rsquo;t do for a man in my position to be
unpopular.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<i>Music&rsquo;s Gay Measure</i>, wailed the voices. The willow trees, outside
the high, narrow windows, waved in the wind. They had lost half their leaves.
The tiny ones that clung wriggled like fishes caught on a line. &ldquo;... I am
not a marrying man....&rdquo; The voices were silent; the piano waited.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite good,&rdquo; said Miss Meadows, but still in such a strange, stony
tone that the younger girls began to feel positively frightened. &ldquo;But now
that we know it, we shall take it with expression. As much expression as you
can put into it. Think of the words, girls. Use your imaginations. <i>Fast! Ah,
too Fast</i>,&rdquo; cried Miss Meadows. &ldquo;That ought to break out&mdash;a
loud, strong <i>forte</i>&mdash;a lament. And then in the second line,
<i>Winter Drear</i>, make that <i>Drear</i> sound as if a cold wind were
blowing through it. <i>Dre-ear!</i>&rdquo; said she so awfully that Mary
Beazley, on the music stool, wriggled her spine. &ldquo;The third line should
be one crescendo. <i>Fleetly! Ah, Fleetly Music&rsquo;s Gay Measure.</i>
Breaking on the first word of the last line, <i>Passes.</i> And then on the
word, <i>Away</i>, you must begin to die... to fade... until <i>The Listening
Ear</i> is nothing more than a faint whisper.... You can slow down as much as
you like almost on the last line. Now, please.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again the two light taps; she lifted her arms again. <i>Fast! Ah, too
Fast.</i> &ldquo;... and the idea of settling down fills me with nothing but
disgust&mdash;&rdquo; Disgust was what he had written. That was as good as to
say their engagement was definitely broken off. Broken off! Their engagement!
People had been surprised enough that she had got engaged. The Science Mistress
would not believe it at first. But nobody had been as surprised as she. She was
thirty. Basil was twenty-five. It had been a miracle, simply a miracle, to hear
him say, as they walked home from church that very dark night, &ldquo;You know,
somehow or other, I&rsquo;ve got fond of you.&rdquo; And he had taken hold of
the end of her ostrich feather boa. <i>Passes away from the Listening
Ear.</i>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Repeat! Repeat!&rdquo; said Miss Meadows. &ldquo;More expression, girls!
Once more!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<i>Fast! Ah, too Fast.</i> The older girls were crimson; some of the younger
ones began to cry. Big spots of rain blew against the windows, and one could
hear the willows whispering, &ldquo;... not that I do not love you....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, my darling, if you love me,&rdquo; thought Miss Meadows, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t mind how much it is. Love me as little as you like.&rdquo; But she
knew he didn&rsquo;t love her. Not to have cared enough to scratch out that
word &ldquo;disgust,&rdquo; so that she couldn&rsquo;t read it! <i>Soon Autumn
yields unto Winter Drear.</i> She would have to leave the school, too. She
could never face the Science Mistress or the girls after it got known. She
would have to disappear somewhere. <i>Passes away.</i> The voices began to die,
to fade, to whisper... to vanish....
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the door opened. A little girl in blue walked fussily up the aisle,
hanging her head, biting her lips, and twisting the silver bangle on her red
little wrist. She came up the steps and stood before Miss Meadows.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Monica, what is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, if you please, Miss Meadows,&rdquo; said the little girl, gasping,
&ldquo;Miss Wyatt wants to see you in the mistress&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Miss Meadows. And she called to the girls,
&ldquo;I shall put you on your honour to talk quietly while I am away.&rdquo;
But they were too subdued to do anything else. Most of them were blowing their
noses.
</p>

<p>
The corridors were silent and cold; they echoed to Miss Meadows&rsquo; steps.
The head mistress sat at her desk. For a moment she did not look up. She was as
usual disentangling her eyeglasses, which had got caught in her lace tie.
&ldquo;Sit down, Miss Meadows,&rdquo; she said very kindly. And then she picked
up a pink envelope from the blotting-pad. &ldquo;I sent for you just now
because this telegram has come for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A telegram for me, Miss Wyatt?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Basil! He had committed suicide, decided Miss Meadows. Her hand flew out, but
Miss Wyatt held the telegram back a moment. &ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s not bad
news,&rdquo; she said, so more than kindly. And Miss Meadows tore it open.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pay no attention to letter, must have been mad, bought hat-stand
to-day&mdash;Basil,&rdquo; she read. She couldn&rsquo;t take her eyes off the
telegram.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do hope it&rsquo;s nothing very serious,&rdquo; said Miss Wyatt,
leaning forward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no, thank you, Miss Wyatt,&rdquo; blushed Miss Meadows.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing bad at all. It&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;and she gave an
apologetic little laugh&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s from my <i>fiancé</i> saying
that... saying that&mdash;&rdquo; There was a pause. &ldquo;I
<i>see</i>,&rdquo; said Miss Wyatt. And another pause.
Then&mdash;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve fifteen minutes more of your class, Miss
Meadows, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Miss Wyatt.&rdquo; She got up. She half ran towards the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, just one minute, Miss Meadows,&rdquo; said Miss Wyatt. &ldquo;I must
say I don&rsquo;t approve of my teachers having telegrams sent to them in
school hours, unless in case of very bad news, such as death,&rdquo; explained
Miss Wyatt, &ldquo;or a very serious accident, or something to that effect.
Good news, Miss Meadows, will always keep, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
On the wings of hope, of love, of joy, Miss Meadows sped back to the music
hall, up the aisle, up the steps, over to the piano.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Page thirty-two, Mary,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;page thirty-two,&rdquo;
and, picking up the yellow chrysanthemum, she held it to her lips to hide her
smile. Then she turned to the girls, rapped with her baton: &ldquo;Page
thirty-two, girls. Page thirty-two.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="poem">
We come here To-day with Flowers o&rsquo;erladen,<br />
With Baskets of Fruit and Ribbons to boot,<br />
To-oo Congratulate . . .
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop! Stop!&rdquo; cried Miss Meadows. &ldquo;This is awful. This is
dreadful.&rdquo; And she beamed at her girls. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter
with you all? Think, girls, think of what you&rsquo;re singing. Use your
imaginations. <i>With Flowers o&rsquo;erladen. Baskets of Fruit and Ribbons to
boot.</i> And <i>Congratulate.</i>&rdquo; Miss Meadows broke off.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so doleful, girls. It ought to sound warm, joyful,
eager. <i>Congratulate.</i> Once more. Quickly. All together. Now then!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And this time Miss Meadows&rsquo; voice sounded over all the other
voices&mdash;full, deep, glowing with expression.
</p>

<p>
<br /><br /><br /><br />
</p>

<p><a name="chap12"></a></p> <h2>The Stranger</h2>

<p>
It seemed to the little crowd on the wharf that she was never going to move
again. There she lay, immense, motionless on the grey crinkled water, a loop of
smoke above her, an immense flock of gulls screaming and diving after the
galley droppings at the stern. You could just see little couples
parading&mdash;little flies walking up and down the dish on the grey crinkled
tablecloth. Other flies clustered and swarmed at the edge. Now there was a
gleam of white on the lower deck&mdash;the cook&rsquo;s apron or the stewardess
perhaps. Now a tiny black spider raced up the ladder on to the bridge.
</p>

<p>
In the front of the crowd a strong-looking, middle-aged man, dressed very well,
very snugly in a grey overcoat, grey silk scarf, thick gloves and dark felt
hat, marched up and down, twirling his folded umbrella. He seemed to be the
leader of the little crowd on the wharf and at the same time to keep them
together. He was something between the sheep-dog and the shepherd.
</p>

<p>
But what a fool&mdash;what a fool he had been not to bring any glasses! There
wasn&rsquo;t a pair of glasses between the whole lot of them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Curious thing, Mr. Scott, that none of us thought of glasses. We might
have been able to stir &rsquo;em up a bit. We might have managed a little
signalling. <i>Don&rsquo;t hesitate to land. Natives harmless.</i> Or: <i>A
welcome awaits you. All is forgiven.</i> What? Eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hammond&rsquo;s quick, eager glance, so nervous and yet so friendly and
confiding, took in everybody on the wharf, roped in even those old chaps
lounging against the gangways. They knew, every man-jack of them, that Mrs.
Hammond was on that boat, and that he was so tremendously excited it never
entered his head not to believe that this marvellous fact meant something to
them too. It warmed his heart towards them. They were, he decided, as decent a
crowd of people&mdash;&mdash; Those old chaps over by the gangways,
too&mdash;fine, solid old chaps. What chests&mdash;by Jove! And he squared his
own, plunged his thick-gloved hands into his pockets, rocked from heel to toe.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, my wife&rsquo;s been in Europe for the last ten months. On a visit
to our eldest girl, who was married last year. I brought her up here, as far as
Salisbury, myself. So I thought I&rsquo;d better come and fetch her back. Yes,
yes, yes.&rdquo; The shrewd grey eyes narrowed again and searched anxiously,
quickly, the motionless liner. Again his overcoat was unbuttoned. Out came the
thin, butter-yellow watch again, and for the
twentieth&mdash;fiftieth&mdash;hundredth time he made the calculation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me see now. It was two fifteen when the doctor&rsquo;s launch went
off. Two fifteen. It is now exactly twenty-eight minutes past four. That is to
say, the doctor&rsquo;s been gone two hours and thirteen minutes. Two hours and
thirteen minutes! Whee-ooh!&rdquo; He gave a queer little half-whistle and
snapped his watch to again. &ldquo;But I think we should have been told if
there was anything up&mdash;don&rsquo;t you, Mr. Gaven?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes, Mr. Hammond! I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything
to&mdash;anything to worry about,&rdquo; said Mr. Gaven, knocking out his pipe
against the heel of his shoe. &ldquo;At the same time&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite so! Quite so!&rdquo; cried Mr. Hammond. &ldquo;Dashed
annoying!&rdquo; He paced quickly up and down and came back again to his stand
between Mr. and Mrs. Scott and Mr. Gaven. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting quite dark,
too,&rdquo; and he waved his folded umbrella as though the dusk at least might
have had the decency to keep off for a bit. But the dusk came slowly, spreading
like a slow stain over the water. Little Jean Scott dragged at her
mother&rsquo;s hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wan&rsquo; my tea, mammy!&rdquo; she wailed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expect you do,&rdquo; said Mr. Hammond. &ldquo;I expect all these
ladies want their tea.&rdquo; And his kind, flushed, almost pitiful glance
roped them all in again. He wondered whether Janey was having a final cup of
tea in the saloon out there. He hoped so; he thought not. It would be just like
her not to leave the deck. In that case perhaps the deck steward would bring
her up a cup. If he&rsquo;d been there he&rsquo;d have got it for
her&mdash;somehow. And for a moment he was on deck, standing over her, watching
her little hand fold round the cup in the way she had, while she drank the only
cup of tea to be got on board.... But now he was back here, and the Lord only
knew when that cursed Captain would stop hanging about in the stream. He took
another turn, up and down, up and down. He walked as far as the cab-stand to
make sure his driver hadn&rsquo;t disappeared; back he swerved again to the
little flock huddled in the shelter of the banana crates. Little Jean Scott was
still wanting her tea. Poor little beggar! He wished he had a bit of chocolate
on him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here, Jean!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Like a lift up?&rdquo; And easily,
gently, he swung the little girl on to a higher barrel. The movement of holding
her, steadying her, relieved him wonderfully, lightened his heart.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; he said, keeping an arm round her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry about <i>Jean</i>, Mr. Hammond!&rdquo; said Mrs.
Scott.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Mrs. Scott. No trouble. It&rsquo;s a pleasure.
Jean&rsquo;s a little pal of mine, aren&rsquo;t you, Jean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Hammond,&rdquo; said Jean, and she ran her finger down the dent
of his felt hat.
</p>

<p>
But suddenly she caught him by the ear and gave a loud scream. &ldquo;Lo-ok,
Mr. Hammond! She&rsquo;s moving! Look, she&rsquo;s coming in!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
By Jove! So she was. At last! She was slowly, slowly turning round. A bell
sounded far over the water and a great spout of steam gushed into the air. The
gulls rose; they fluttered away like bits of white paper. And whether that deep
throbbing was her engines or his heart Mr. Hammond couldn&rsquo;t say. He had
to nerve himself to bear it, whatever it was. At that moment old Captain
Johnson, the harbour-master, came striding down the wharf, a leather portfolio
under his arm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jean&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; said Mr. Scott. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
hold her.&rdquo; He was just in time. Mr. Hammond had forgotten about Jean. He
sprang away to greet old Captain Johnson.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Captain,&rdquo; the eager, nervous voice rang out again,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve taken pity on us at last.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good blaming me, Mr. Hammond,&rdquo; wheezed old Captain
Johnson, staring at the liner. &ldquo;You got Mrs. Hammond on board,
ain&rsquo;t yer?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; said Hammond, and he kept by the harbour-master&rsquo;s
side. &ldquo;Mrs. Hammond&rsquo;s there. Hul-lo! We shan&rsquo;t be long
now!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With her telephone ring-ringing, the thrum of her screw filling the air, the
big liner bore down on them, cutting sharp through the dark water so that big
white shavings curled to either side. Hammond and the harbour-master kept in
front of the rest. Hammond took off his hat; he raked the decks&mdash;they were
crammed with passengers; he waved his hat and bawled a loud, strange
&ldquo;Hul-lo!&rdquo; across the water; and then turned round and burst out
laughing and said something&mdash;nothing&mdash;to old Captain Johnson.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Seen her?&rdquo; asked the harbour-master.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, not yet. Steady&mdash;wait a bit!&rdquo; And suddenly, between two
great clumsy idiots&mdash;&ldquo;Get out of the way there!&rdquo; he signed
with his umbrella&mdash;he saw a hand raised&mdash;a white glove shaking a
handkerchief. Another moment, and&mdash;thank God, thank God!&mdash;there she
was. There was Janey. There was Mrs. Hammond, yes, yes, yes&mdash;standing by
the rail and smiling and nodding and waving her handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s first class&mdash;first class! Well, well,
well!&rdquo; He positively stamped. Like lightning he drew out his cigar-case
and offered it to old Captain Johnson. &ldquo;Have a cigar, Captain!
They&rsquo;re pretty good. Have a couple! Here&rdquo;&mdash;and he pressed all
the cigars in the case on the harbour-master&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a couple
of boxes up at the hotel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thenks, Mr. Hammond!&rdquo; wheezed old Captain Johnson.
</p>

<p>
Hammond stuffed the cigar-case back. His hands were shaking, but he&rsquo;d got
hold of himself again. He was able to face Janey. There she was, leaning on the
rail, talking to some woman and at the same time watching him, ready for him.
It struck him, as the gulf of water closed, how small she looked on that huge
ship. His heart was wrung with such a spasm that he could have cried out. How
little she looked to have come all that long way and back by herself! Just like
her, though. Just like Janey. She had the courage of a&mdash;&mdash; And now
the crew had come forward and parted the passengers; they had lowered the rails
for the gangways.
</p>

<p>
The voices on shore and the voices on board flew to greet each other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All well?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s mother?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Much better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hullo, Jean!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hillo, Aun&rsquo; Emily!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Had a good voyage?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t be long now!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not long now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The engines stopped. Slowly she edged to the wharf-side.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Make way there&mdash;make way&mdash;make way!&rdquo; And the wharf hands
brought the heavy gangways along at a sweeping run. Hammond signed to Janey to
stay where she was. The old harbour-master stepped forward; he followed. As to
&ldquo;ladies first,&rdquo; or any rot like that, it never entered his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After you, Captain!&rdquo; he cried genially. And, treading on the old
man&rsquo;s heels, he strode up the gangway on to the deck in a bee-line to
Janey, and Janey was clasped in his arms.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well, well! Yes, yes! Here we are at last!&rdquo; he stammered. It
was all he could say. And Janey emerged, and her cool little voice&mdash;the
only voice in the world for him&mdash;said,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, darling! Have you been waiting long?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
No; not long. Or, at any rate, it didn&rsquo;t matter. It was over now. But the
point was, he had a cab waiting at the end of the wharf. Was she ready to go
off. Was her luggage ready? In that case they could cut off sharp with her
cabin luggage and let the rest go hang until to-morrow. He bent over her and
she looked up with her familiar half-smile. She was just the same. Not a day
changed. Just as he&rsquo;d always known her. She laid her small hand on his
sleeve.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How are the children, John?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
(Hang the children!) &ldquo;Perfectly well. Never better in their lives.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t they sent me letters?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;of course! I&rsquo;ve left them at the hotel for you to
digest later on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go quite so fast,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
people to say good-bye to&mdash;and then there&rsquo;s the Captain.&rdquo; As
his face fell she gave his arm a small understanding squeeze. &ldquo;If the
Captain comes off the bridge I want you to thank him for having looked after
your wife so beautifully.&rdquo; Well, he&rsquo;d got her. If she wanted
another ten minutes&mdash;As he gave way she was surrounded. The whole
first-class seemed to want to say good-bye to Janey.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-bye, <i>dear</i> Mrs. Hammond! And next time you&rsquo;re in Sydney
I&rsquo;ll <i>expect</i> you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Darling Mrs. Hammond! You won&rsquo;t forget to write to me, will
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Mrs. Hammond, what this boat would have been without you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was as plain as a pikestaff that she was by far the most popular woman on
board. And she took it all&mdash;just as usual. Absolutely composed. Just her
little self&mdash;just Janey all over; standing there with her veil thrown
back. Hammond never noticed what his wife had on. It was all the same to him
whatever she wore. But to-day he did notice that she wore a black
&ldquo;costume&rdquo;&mdash;didn&rsquo;t they call it?&mdash;with white frills,
trimmings he supposed they were, at the neck and sleeves. All this while Janey
handed him round.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;John, dear!&rdquo; And then: &ldquo;I want to introduce you
to&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Finally they did escape, and she led the way to her state-room. To follow Janey
down the passage that she knew so well&mdash;that was so strange to him; to
part the green curtains after her and to step into the cabin that had been hers
gave him exquisite happiness. But&mdash;confound it!&mdash;the stewardess was
there on the floor, strapping up the rugs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the last, Mrs. Hammond,&rdquo; said the stewardess, rising
and pulling down her cuffs.
</p>

<p>
He was introduced again, and then Janey and the stewardess disappeared into the
passage. He heard whisperings. She was getting the tipping business over, he
supposed. He sat down on the striped sofa and took his hat off. There were the
rugs she had taken with her; they looked good as new. All her luggage looked
fresh, perfect. The labels were written in her beautiful little clear
hand&mdash;&ldquo;Mrs. John Hammond.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mrs. John Hammond!&rdquo; He gave a long sigh of content and leaned
back, crossing his arms. The strain was over. He felt he could have sat there
for ever sighing his relief&mdash;the relief at being rid of that horrible tug,
pull, grip on his heart. The danger was over. That was the feeling. They were
on dry land again.
</p>

<p>
But at that moment Janey&rsquo;s head came round the corner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Darling&mdash;do you mind? I just want to go and say good-bye to the
doctor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hammond started up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother. I&rsquo;d rather
not. I&rsquo;ll not be a minute.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And before he could answer she was gone. He had half a mind to run after her;
but instead he sat down again.
</p>

<p>
Would she really not be long? What was the time now? Out came the watch; he
stared at nothing. That was rather queer of Janey, wasn&rsquo;t it? Why
couldn&rsquo;t she have told the stewardess to say good-bye for her? Why did
she have to go chasing after the ship&rsquo;s doctor? She could have sent a
note from the hotel even if the affair had been urgent. Urgent? Did
it&mdash;could it mean that she had been ill on the voyage&mdash;she was
keeping something from him? That was it! He seized his hat. He was going off to
find that fellow and to wring the truth out of him at all costs. He thought
he&rsquo;d noticed just something. She was just a touch too calm&mdash;too
steady. From the very first moment&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The curtains rang. Janey was back. He jumped to his feet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Janey, have you been ill on this voyage? You have!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ill?&rdquo; Her airy little voice mocked him. She stepped over the rugs,
and came up close, touched his breast, and looked up at him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t frighten me. Of course I
haven&rsquo;t! Whatever makes you think I have? Do I look ill?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Hammond didn&rsquo;t see her. He only felt that she was looking at him and
that there was no need to worry about anything. She was here to look after
things. It was all right. Everything was.
</p>

<p>
The gentle pressure of her hand was so calming that he put his over hers to
hold it there. And she said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stand still. I want to look at you. I haven&rsquo;t seen you yet.
You&rsquo;ve had your beard beautifully trimmed, and you look&mdash;younger, I
think, and decidedly thinner! Bachelor life agrees with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Agrees with me!&rdquo; He groaned for love and caught her close again.
And again, as always, he had the feeling that he was holding something that
never was quite his&mdash;his. Something too delicate, too precious, that would
fly away once he let go.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake let&rsquo;s get off to the hotel so that we can be
by ourselves!&rdquo; And he rang the bell hard for some one to look sharp with
the luggage.
</p>

<p>
<br /><br />
</p>

<hr />

<p>
<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
Walking down the wharf together she took his arm. He had her on his arm again.
And the difference it made to get into the cab after Janey&mdash;to throw the
red-and-yellow striped blanket round them both&mdash;to tell the driver to
hurry because neither of them had had any tea. No more going without his tea or
pouring out his own. She was back. He turned to her, squeezed her hand, and
said gently, teasingly, in the &ldquo;special&rdquo; voice he had for her:
&ldquo;Glad to be home again, dearie?&rdquo; She smiled; she didn&rsquo;t even
bother to answer, but gently she drew his hand away as they came to the
brighter streets.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got the best room in the hotel,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t be put off with another. And I asked the chambermaid to put in a
bit of a fire in case you felt chilly. She&rsquo;s a nice, attentive girl. And
I thought now we were here we wouldn&rsquo;t bother to go home to-morrow, but
spend the day looking round and leave the morning after. Does that suit you?
There&rsquo;s no hurry, is there? The children will have you soon enough.... I
thought a day&rsquo;s sight-seeing might make a nice break in your
journey&mdash;eh, Janey?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you taken the tickets for the day after?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should think I have!&rdquo; He unbuttoned his overcoat and took out
his bulging pocket-book. &ldquo;Here we are! I reserved a first-class carriage
to Cooktown. There it is&mdash;&lsquo;Mr. <i>and</i> Mrs. John Hammond.&rsquo;
I thought we might as well do ourselves comfortably, and we don&rsquo;t want
other people butting in, do we? But if you&rsquo;d like to stop here a bit
longer&mdash;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said Janey quickly. &ldquo;Not for the world! The day
after to-morrow, then. And the children&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But they had reached the hotel. The manager was standing in the broad,
brilliantly-lighted porch. He came down to greet them. A porter ran from the
hall for their boxes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Mr. Arnold, here&rsquo;s Mrs. Hammond at last!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The manager led them through the hall himself and pressed the elevator-bell.
Hammond knew there were business pals of his sitting at the little hall tables
having a drink before dinner. But he wasn&rsquo;t going to risk interruption;
he looked neither to the right nor the left. They could think what they
pleased. If they didn&rsquo;t understand, the more fools they&mdash;and he
stepped out of the lift, unlocked the door of their room, and shepherded Janey
in. The door shut. Now, at last, they were alone together. He turned up the
light. The curtains were drawn; the fire blazed. He flung his hat on to the
huge bed and went towards her.
</p>

<p>
But&mdash;would you believe it!&mdash;again they were interrupted. This time it
was the porter with the luggage. He made two journeys of it, leaving the door
open in between, taking his time, whistling through his teeth in the corridor.
Hammond paced up and down the room, tearing off his gloves, tearing off his
scarf. Finally he flung his overcoat on to the bedside.
</p>

<p>
At last the fool was gone. The door clicked. Now they <i>were</i> alone. Said
Hammond: &ldquo;I feel I&rsquo;ll never have you to myself again. These cursed
people! Janey&rdquo;&mdash;and he bent his flushed, eager gaze upon
her&mdash;&ldquo;let&rsquo;s have dinner up here. If we go down to the
restaurant we&rsquo;ll be interrupted, and then there&rsquo;s the confounded
music&rdquo; (the music he&rsquo;d praised so highly, applauded so loudly last
night!). &ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t be able to hear each other speak. Let&rsquo;s
have something up here in front of the fire. It&rsquo;s too late for tea.
I&rsquo;ll order a little supper, shall I? How does that idea strike you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do, darling!&rdquo; said Janey. &ldquo;And while you&rsquo;re
away&mdash;the children&rsquo;s letters&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, later on will do!&rdquo; said Hammond.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But then we&rsquo;d get it over,&rdquo; said Janey. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;d
first have time to&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I needn&rsquo;t go down!&rdquo; explained Hammond. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
just ring and give the order... you don&rsquo;t want to send me away, do
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Janey shook her head and smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re thinking of something else. You&rsquo;re worrying about
something,&rdquo; said Hammond. &ldquo;What is it? Come and sit here&mdash;come
and sit on my knee before the fire.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just unpin my hat,&rdquo; said Janey, and she went over to
the dressing-table. &ldquo;A-ah!&rdquo; She gave a little cry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing, darling. I&rsquo;ve just found the children&rsquo;s letters.
That&rsquo;s all right! They will keep. No hurry now!&rdquo; She turned to him,
clasping them. She tucked them into her frilled blouse. She cried quickly,
gaily: &ldquo;Oh, how typical this dressing-table is of you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why? What&rsquo;s the matter with it?&rdquo; said Hammond.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If it were floating in eternity I should say &lsquo;John!&rsquo;&rdquo;
laughed Janey, staring at the big bottle of hair tonic, the wicker bottle of
eau-de-Cologne, the two hair-brushes, and a dozen new collars tied with pink
tape. &ldquo;Is this all your luggage?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hang my luggage!&rdquo; said Hammond; but all the same he liked being
laughed at by Janey. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk. Let&rsquo;s get down to things.
Tell me&rdquo;&mdash;and as Janey perched on his knees he leaned back and drew
her into the deep, ugly chair&mdash;&ldquo;tell me you&rsquo;re really glad to
be back, Janey.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, darling, I am glad,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
But just as when he embraced her he felt she would fly away, so Hammond never
knew&mdash;never knew for dead certain that she was as glad as he was. How
could he know? Would he ever know? Would he always have this craving&mdash;this
pang like hunger, somehow, to make Janey so much part of him that there
wasn&rsquo;t any of her to escape? He wanted to blot out everybody, everything.
He wished now he&rsquo;d turned off the light. That might have brought her
nearer. And now those letters from the children rustled in her blouse. He could
have chucked them into the fire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Janey,&rdquo; he whispered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, dear?&rdquo; She lay on his breast, but so lightly, so remotely.
Their breathing rose and fell together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Janey!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Turn to me,&rdquo; he whispered. A slow, deep flush flowed into his
forehead. &ldquo;Kiss me, Janey! You kiss me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It seemed to him there was a tiny pause&mdash;but long enough for him to suffer
torture&mdash;before her lips touched his, firmly, lightly&mdash;kissing them
as she always kissed him, as though the kiss&mdash;how could he describe
it?&mdash;confirmed what they were saying, signed the contract. But that
wasn&rsquo;t what he wanted; that wasn&rsquo;t at all what he thirsted for. He
felt suddenly, horrible tired.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you knew,&rdquo; he said, opening his eyes, &ldquo;what it&rsquo;s
been like&mdash;waiting to-day. I thought the boat never would come in. There
we were, hanging about. What kept you so long?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She made no answer. She was looking away from him at the fire. The flames
hurried&mdash;hurried over the coals, flickered, fell.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not asleep, are you?&rdquo; said Hammond, and he jumped her up and down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. And then: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, dear. No, I
was thinking. As a matter of fact,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;one of the
passengers died last night&mdash;a man. That&rsquo;s what held us up. We
brought him in&mdash;I mean, he wasn&rsquo;t buried at sea. So, of course, the
ship&rsquo;s doctor and the shore doctor&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; asked Hammond uneasily. He hated to hear of death.
He hated this to have happened. It was, in some queer way, as though he and
Janey had met a funeral on their way to the hotel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t anything in the least infectious!&rdquo; said Janey.
She was speaking scarcely above her breath. &ldquo;It was <i>heart</i>.&rdquo;
A pause. &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Quite young.&rdquo; And
she watched the fire flicker and fall. &ldquo;He died in my arms,&rdquo; said
Janey.
</p>

<p>
The blow was so sudden that Hammond thought he would faint. He couldn&rsquo;t
move; he couldn&rsquo;t breathe. He felt all his strength flowing&mdash;flowing
into the big dark chair, and the big dark chair held him fast, gripped him,
forced him to bear it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said dully. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The end was quite peaceful,&rdquo; said the small voice. &ldquo;He
just&rdquo;&mdash;and Hammond saw her lift her gentle
hand&mdash;&ldquo;breathed his life away at the end.&rdquo; And her hand fell.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who&mdash;else was there?&rdquo; Hammond managed to ask.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nobody. I was alone with him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ah, my God, what was she saying! What was she doing to him! This would kill
him! And all the while she spoke:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I saw the change coming and I sent the steward for the doctor, but the
doctor was too late. He couldn&rsquo;t have done anything, anyway.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But&mdash;why <i>you</i>, why <i>you</i>?&rdquo; moaned Hammond.
</p>

<p>
At that Janey turned quickly, quickly searched his face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t <i>mind</i>, John, do you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t&mdash;It&rsquo;s nothing to do with you and me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Somehow or other he managed to shake some sort of smile at her. Somehow or
other he stammered: &ldquo;No&mdash;go&mdash;on, go on! I want you to tell
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, John darling&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me, Janey!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to tell,&rdquo; she said, wondering. &ldquo;He was
one of the first-class passengers. I saw he was very ill when he came on
board.... But he seemed to be so much better until yesterday. He had a severe
attack in the afternoon&mdash;excitement&mdash;nervousness, I think, about
arriving. And after that he never recovered.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t the stewardess&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my dear&mdash;the stewardess!&rdquo; said Janey. &ldquo;What would
he have felt? And besides... he might have wanted to leave a message...
to&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; muttered Hammond. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he say
anything?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, darling, not a word!&rdquo; She shook her head softly. &ldquo;All
the time I was with him he was too weak... he was too weak even to move a
finger....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Janey was silent. But her words, so light, so soft, so chill, seemed to hover
in the air, to rain into his breast like snow.
</p>

<p>
The fire had gone red. Now it fell in with a sharp sound and the room was
colder. Cold crept up his arms. The room was huge, immense, glittering. It
filled his whole world. There was the great blind bed, with his coat flung
across it like some headless man saying his prayers. There was the luggage,
ready to be carried away again, anywhere, tossed into trains, carted on to
boats.
</p>

<p>
... &ldquo;He was too weak. He was too weak to move a finger.&rdquo; And yet he
died in Janey&rsquo;s arms. She&mdash;who&rsquo;d never&mdash;never once in all
these years&mdash;never on one single solitary occasion&mdash;
</p>

<p>
No; he mustn&rsquo;t think of it. Madness lay in thinking of it. No, he
wouldn&rsquo;t face it. He couldn&rsquo;t stand it. It was too much to bear!
</p>

<p>
And now Janey touched his tie with her fingers. She pinched the edges of the
tie together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not&mdash;sorry I told you, John darling? It hasn&rsquo;t
made you sad? It hasn&rsquo;t spoilt our evening&mdash;our being alone
together?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But at that he had to hide his face. He put his face into her bosom and his
arms enfolded her.
</p>

<p>
Spoilt their evening! Spoilt their being alone together! They would never be
alone together again.
</p>

<p><a name="chap13"></a></p> <h2>Bank Holiday</h2>

<p>
A stout man with a pink face wears dingy white flannel trousers, a blue coat
with a pink handkerchief showing, and a straw hat much too small for him,
perched at the back of his head. He plays the guitar. A little chap in white
canvas shoes, his face hidden under a felt hat like a broken wing, breathes
into a flute; and a tall thin fellow, with bursting over-ripe button boots,
draws ribbons&mdash;long, twisted, streaming ribbons&mdash;of tune out of a
fiddle. They stand, unsmiling, but not serious, in the broad sunlight opposite
the fruit-shop; the pink spider of a hand beats the guitar, the little squat
hand, with a brass-and-turquoise ring, forces the reluctant flute, and the
fiddler&rsquo;s arm tries to saw the fiddle in two.
</p>

<p>
A crowd collects, eating oranges and bananas, tearing off the skins, dividing,
sharing. One young girl has even a basket of strawberries, but she does not eat
them. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they <i>dear</i>!&rdquo; She stares at the tiny
pointed fruits as if she were afraid of them. The Australian soldier laughs.
&ldquo;Here, go on, there&rsquo;s not more than a mouthful.&rdquo; But he
doesn&rsquo;t want her to eat them, either. He likes to watch her little
frightened face, and her puzzled eyes lifted to his: &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they a
<i>price</i>!&rdquo; He pushes out his chest and grins. Old fat women in velvet
bodices&mdash;old dusty pin-cushions&mdash;lean old hags like worn umbrellas
with a quivering bonnet on top; young women, in muslins, with hats that might
have grown on hedges, and high pointed shoes; men in khaki, sailors, shabby
clerks, young Jews in fine cloth suits with padded shoulders and wide trousers,
&ldquo;hospital boys&rdquo; in blue&mdash;the sun discovers them&mdash;the
loud, bold music holds them together in one big knot for a moment. The young
ones are larking, pushing each other on and off the pavement, dodging, nudging;
the old ones are talking: &ldquo;So I said to &rsquo;im, if you wants the
doctor to yourself, fetch &rsquo;im, says I.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An&rsquo; by the time they was cooked there wasn&rsquo;t so much as you
could put in the palm of me &rsquo;and!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The only ones who are quiet are the ragged children. They stand, as close up to
the musicians as they can get, their hands behind their backs, their eyes big.
Occasionally a leg hops, an arm wags. A tiny staggerer, overcome, turns round
twice, sits down solemn, and then gets up again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it lovely?&rdquo; whispers a small girl behind her hand.
</p>

<p>
And the music breaks into bright pieces, and joins together again, and again
breaks, and is dissolved, and the crowd scatters, moving slowly up the hill.
</p>

<p>
At the corner of the road the stalls begin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ticklers! Tuppence a tickler! &rsquo;Ool &rsquo;ave a tickler? Tickle
&rsquo;em up, boys.&rdquo; Little soft brooms on wire handles. They are eagerly
bought by the soldiers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Buy a golliwog! Tuppence a golliwog!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Buy a jumping donkey! All alive-oh!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Su</i>-perior chewing gum. Buy something to do, boys.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Buy a rose. Give &rsquo;er a rose, boy. Roses, lady?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fevvers! Fevvers!&rdquo; They are hard to resist. Lovely, streaming
feathers, emerald green, scarlet, bright blue, canary yellow. Even the babies
wear feathers threaded through their bonnets.
</p>

<p>
And an old woman in a three-cornered paper hat cries as if it were her final
parting advice, the only way of saving yourself or of bringing him to his
senses: &ldquo;Buy a three-cornered &rsquo;at, my dear, an&rsquo; put it
on!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It is a flying day, half sun, half wind. When the sun goes in a shadow flies
over; when it comes out again it is fiery. The men and women feel it burning
their backs, their breasts and their arms; they feel their bodies expanding,
coming alive... so that they make large embracing gestures, lift up their arms,
for nothing, swoop down on a girl, blurt into laughter.
</p>

<p>
Lemonade! A whole tank of it stands on a table covered with a cloth; and lemons
like blunted fishes blob in the yellow water. It looks solid, like a jelly, in
the thick glasses. Why can&rsquo;t they drink it without spilling it? Everybody
spills it, and before the glass is handed back the last drops are thrown in a
ring.
</p>

<p>
Round the ice-cream cart, with its striped awning and bright brass cover, the
children cluster. Little tongues lick, lick round the cream trumpets, round the
squares. The cover is lifted, the wooden spoon plunges in; one shuts
one&rsquo;s eyes to feel it, silently scrunching.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let these little birds tell you your future!&rdquo; She stands beside
the cage, a shrivelled ageless Italian, clasping and unclasping her dark claws.
Her face, a treasure of delicate carving, is tied in a green-and-gold scarf.
And inside their prison the love-birds flutter towards the papers in the
seed-tray.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have great strength of character. You will marry a red-haired man
and have three children. Beware of a blonde woman.&rdquo; Look out! Look out! A
motor-car driven by a fat chauffeur comes rushing down the hill. Inside there a
blonde woman, pouting, leaning forward&mdash;rushing through your
life&mdash;beware! beware!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, I am an auctioneer by profession, and if what I
tell you is not the truth I am liable to have my licence taken away from me and
a heavy imprisonment.&rdquo; He holds the licence across his chest; the sweat
pours down his face into his paper collar; his eyes look glazed. When he takes
off his hat there is a deep pucker of angry flesh on his forehead. Nobody buys
a watch.
</p>

<p>
Look out again! A huge barouche comes swinging down the hill with two old, old
babies inside. She holds up a lace parasol; he sucks the knob of his cane, and
the fat old bodies roll together as the cradle rocks, and the steaming horse
leaves a trail of manure as it ambles down the hill.
</p>

<p>
Under a tree, Professor Leonard, in cap and gown, stands beside his banner. He
is here &ldquo;for one day,&rdquo; from the London, Paris and Brussels
Exhibition, to tell your fortune from your face. And he stands, smiling
encouragement, like a clumsy dentist. When the big men, romping and swearing a
moment before, hand across their sixpence, and stand before him, they are
suddenly serious, dumb, timid, almost blushing as the Professor&rsquo;s quick
hand notches the printed card. They are like little children caught playing in
a forbidden garden by the owner, stepping from behind a tree.
</p>

<p>
The top of the hill is reached. How hot it is! How fine it is! The public-house
is open, and the crowd presses in. The mother sits on the pavement edge with
her baby, and the father brings her out a glass of dark, brownish stuff, and
then savagely elbows his way in again. A reek of beer floats from the
public-house, and a loud clatter and rattle of voices.
</p>

<p>
The wind has dropped, and the sun burns more fiercely than ever. Outside the
two swing-doors there is a thick mass of children like flies at the mouth of a
sweet-jar.
</p>

<p>
And up, up the hill come the people, with ticklers and golliwogs, and roses and
feathers. Up, up they thrust into the light and heat, shouting, laughing,
squealing, as though they were being pushed by something, far below, and by the
sun, far ahead of them&mdash;drawn up into the full, bright, dazzling radiance
to... what?

<p>
That evening for the first time in his life, as he pressed through the swing
door and descended the three broad steps to the pavement, old Mr. Neave felt he
was too old for the spring. Spring&mdash;warm, eager, restless&mdash;was there,
waiting for him in the golden light, ready in front of everybody to run up, to
blow in his white beard, to drag sweetly on his arm. And he couldn&rsquo;t meet
her, no; he couldn&rsquo;t square up once more and stride off, jaunty as a
young man. He was tired and, although the late sun was still shining, curiously
cold, with a numbed feeling all over. Quite suddenly he hadn&rsquo;t the
energy, he hadn&rsquo;t the heart to stand this gaiety and bright movement any
longer; it confused him. He wanted to stand still, to wave it away with his
stick, to say, &ldquo;Be off with you!&rdquo; Suddenly it was a terrible effort
to greet as usual&mdash;tipping his wide-awake with his stick&mdash;all the
people whom he knew, the friends, acquaintances, shopkeepers, postmen, drivers.
But the gay glance that went with the gesture, the kindly twinkle that seemed
to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a match and more for any of you&rdquo;&mdash;that old
Mr. Neave could not manage at all. He stumped along, lifting his knees high as
if he were walking through air that had somehow grown heavy and solid like
water. And the homeward-looking crowd hurried by, the trams clanked, the light
carts clattered, the big swinging cabs bowled along with that reckless, defiant
indifference that one knows only in dreams....
</p>

<p>
It had been a day like other days at the office. Nothing special had happened.
Harold hadn&rsquo;t come back from lunch until close on four. Where had he
been? What had he been up to? He wasn&rsquo;t going to let his father know. Old
Mr. Neave had happened to be in the vestibule, saying good-bye to a caller,
when Harold sauntered in, perfectly turned out as usual, cool, suave, smiling
that peculiar little half-smile that women found so fascinating.
</p>

<p>
Ah, Harold was too handsome, too handsome by far; that had been the trouble all
along. No man had a right to such eyes, such lashes, and such lips; it was
uncanny. As for his mother, his sisters, and the servants, it was not too much
to say they made a young god of him; they worshipped Harold, they forgave him
everything; and he had needed some forgiving ever since the time when he was
thirteen and he had stolen his mother&rsquo;s purse, taken the money, and
hidden the purse in the cook&rsquo;s bedroom. Old Mr. Neave struck sharply with
his stick upon the pavement edge. But it wasn&rsquo;t only his family who
spoiled Harold, he reflected, it was everybody; he had only to look and to
smile, and down they went before him. So perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t to be wondered
at that he expected the office to carry on the tradition. H&rsquo;m, h&rsquo;m!
But it couldn&rsquo;t be done. No business&mdash;not even a successful,
established, big paying concern&mdash;could be played with. A man had either to
put his whole heart and soul into it, or it went all to pieces before his
eyes....
</p>

<p>
And then Charlotte and the girls were always at him to make the whole thing
over to Harold, to retire, and to spend his time enjoying himself. Enjoying
himself! Old Mr. Neave stopped dead under a group of ancient cabbage palms
outside the Government buildings! Enjoying himself! The wind of evening shook
the dark leaves to a thin airy cackle. Sitting at home, twiddling his thumbs,
conscious all the while that his life&rsquo;s work was slipping away,
dissolving, disappearing through Harold&rsquo;s fine fingers, while Harold
smiled....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why will you be so unreasonable, father? There&rsquo;s absolutely no
need for you to go to the office. It only makes it very awkward for us when
people persist in saying how tired you&rsquo;re looking. Here&rsquo;s this huge
house and garden. Surely you could be happy in&mdash;in&mdash;appreciating it
for a change. Or you could take up some hobby.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Lola the baby had chimed in loftily, &ldquo;All men ought to have hobbies.
It makes life impossible if they haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Well, well! He couldn&rsquo;t help a grim smile as painfully he began to climb
the hill that led into Harcourt Avenue. Where would Lola and her sisters and
Charlotte be if he&rsquo;d gone in for hobbies, he&rsquo;d like to know?
Hobbies couldn&rsquo;t pay for the town house and the seaside bungalow, and
their horses, and their golf, and the sixty-guinea gramophone in the music-room
for them to dance to. Not that he grudged them these things. No, they were
smart, good-looking girls, and Charlotte was a remarkable woman; it was natural
for them to be in the swim. As a matter of fact, no other house in the town was
as popular as theirs; no other family entertained so much. And how many times
old Mr. Neave, pushing the cigar box across the smoking-room table, had
listened to praises of his wife, his girls, of himself even.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an ideal family, sir, an ideal family. It&rsquo;s like
something one reads about or sees on the stage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, my boy,&rdquo; old Mr. Neave would reply.
&ldquo;Try one of those; I think you&rsquo;ll like them. And if you care to
smoke in the garden, you&rsquo;ll find the girls on the lawn, I dare
say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That was why the girls had never married, so people said. They could have
married anybody. But they had too good a time at home. They were too happy
together, the girls and Charlotte. H&rsquo;m, h&rsquo;m! Well, well. Perhaps
so....
</p>

<p>
By this time he had walked the length of fashionable Harcourt Avenue; he had
reached the corner house, their house. The carriage gates were pushed back;
there were fresh marks of wheels on the drive. And then he faced the big
white-painted house, with its wide-open windows, its tulle curtains floating
outwards, its blue jars of hyacinths on the broad sills. On either side of the
carriage porch their hydrangeas&mdash;famous in the town&mdash;were coming into
flower; the pinkish, bluish masses of flower lay like light among the spreading
leaves. And somehow, it seemed to old Mr. Neave that the house and the flowers,
and even the fresh marks on the drive, were saying, &ldquo;There is young life
here. There are girls&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The hall, as always, was dusky with wraps, parasols, gloves, piled on the oak
chests. From the music-room sounded the piano, quick, loud and impatient.
Through the drawing-room door that was ajar voices floated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And were there ices?&rdquo; came from Charlotte. Then the creak, creak
of her rocker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ices!&rdquo; cried Ethel. &ldquo;My dear mother, you never saw such
ices. Only two kinds. And one a common little strawberry shop ice, in a sopping
wet frill.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The food altogether was too appalling,&rdquo; came from Marion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Still, it&rsquo;s rather early for ices,&rdquo; said Charlotte easily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why, if one has them at all....&rdquo; began Ethel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, quite so, darling,&rdquo; crooned Charlotte.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the music-room door opened and Lola dashed out. She started, she
nearly screamed, at the sight of old Mr. Neave.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gracious, father! What a fright you gave me! Have you just come home?
Why isn&rsquo;t Charles here to help you off with your coat?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her cheeks were crimson from playing, her eyes glittered, the hair fell over
her forehead. And she breathed as though she had come running through the dark
and was frightened. Old Mr. Neave stared at his youngest daughter; he felt he
had never seen her before. So that was Lola, was it? But she seemed to have
forgotten her father; it was not for him that she was waiting there. Now she
put the tip of her crumpled handkerchief between her teeth and tugged at it
angrily. The telephone rang. A-ah! Lola gave a cry like a sob and dashed past
him. The door of the telephone-room slammed, and at the same moment Charlotte
called, &ldquo;Is that you, father?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re tired again,&rdquo; said Charlotte reproachfully, and she
stopped the rocker and offered her warm plum-like cheek. Bright-haired Ethel
pecked his beard, Marion&rsquo;s lips brushed his ear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you walk back, father?&rdquo; asked Charlotte.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I walked home,&rdquo; said old Mr. Neave, and he sank into one of
the immense drawing-room chairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you take a cab?&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;There are
hundreds of cabs about at that time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear Ethel,&rdquo; cried Marion, &ldquo;if father prefers to tire
himself out, I really don&rsquo;t see what business of ours it is to
interfere.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Children, children?&rdquo; coaxed Charlotte.
</p>

<p>
But Marion wouldn&rsquo;t be stopped. &ldquo;No, mother, you spoil father, and
it&rsquo;s not right. You ought to be stricter with him. He&rsquo;s very
naughty.&rdquo; She laughed her hard, bright laugh and patted her hair in a
mirror. Strange! When she was a little girl she had such a soft, hesitating
voice; she had even stuttered, and now, whatever she said&mdash;even if it was
only &ldquo;Jam, please, father&rdquo;&mdash;it rang out as though she were on
the stage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did Harold leave the office before you, dear?&rdquo; asked Charlotte,
beginning to rock again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; said Old Mr. Neave. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
sure. I didn&rsquo;t see him after four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He said&mdash;&rdquo; began Charlotte.
</p>

<p>
But at that moment Ethel, who was twitching over the leaves of some paper or
other, ran to her mother and sank down beside her chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There, you see,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I mean,
mummy. Yellow, with touches of silver. Don&rsquo;t you agree?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give it to me, love,&rdquo; said Charlotte. She fumbled for her
tortoise-shell spectacles and put them on, gave the page a little dab with her
plump small fingers, and pursed up her lips. &ldquo;Very sweet!&rdquo; she
crooned vaguely; she looked at Ethel over her spectacles. &ldquo;But I
shouldn&rsquo;t have the train.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not the train!&rdquo; wailed Ethel tragically. &ldquo;But the
train&rsquo;s the whole point.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here, mother, let me decide.&rdquo; Marion snatched the paper playfully
from Charlotte. &ldquo;I agree with mother,&rdquo; she cried triumphantly.
&ldquo;The train overweights it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Old Mr. Neave, forgotten, sank into the broad lap of his chair, and, dozing,
heard them as though he dreamed. There was no doubt about it, he was tired out;
he had lost his hold. Even Charlotte and the girls were too much for him
to-night. They were too... too.... But all his drowsing brain could think of
was&mdash;too <i>rich</i> for him. And somewhere at the back of everything he
was watching a little withered ancient man climbing up endless flights of
stairs. Who was he?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t dress to-night,&rdquo; he muttered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you say, father?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh, what, what?&rdquo; Old Mr. Neave woke with a start and stared across
at them. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t dress to-night,&rdquo; he repeated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, father, we&rsquo;ve got Lucile coming, and Henry Davenport, and
Mrs. Teddie Walker.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It will look so <i>very</i> out of the picture.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel well, dear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t make any effort. What is Charles <i>for</i>?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re really not up to it,&rdquo; Charlotte wavered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well! Very well!&rdquo; Old Mr. Neave got up and went to join that
little old climbing fellow just as far as his dressing-room....
</p>

<p>
There young Charles was waiting for him. Carefully, as though everything
depended on it, he was tucking a towel round the hot-water can. Young Charles
had been a favourite of his ever since as a little red-faced boy he had come
into the house to look after the fires. Old Mr. Neave lowered himself into the
cane lounge by the window, stretched out his legs, and made his little evening
joke, &ldquo;Dress him up, Charles!&rdquo; And Charles, breathing intensely and
frowning, bent forward to take the pin out of his tie.
</p>

<p>
H&rsquo;m, h&rsquo;m! Well, well! It was pleasant by the open window, very
pleasant&mdash;a fine mild evening. They were cutting the grass on the tennis
court below; he heard the soft churr of the mower. Soon the girls would begin
their tennis parties again. And at the thought he seemed to hear Marion&rsquo;s
voice ring out, &ldquo;Good for you, partner.... Oh, <i>played</i>, partner....
Oh, <i>very</i> nice indeed.&rdquo; Then Charlotte calling from the veranda,
&ldquo;Where is Harold?&rdquo; And Ethel, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s certainly not here,
mother.&rdquo; And Charlotte&rsquo;s vague, &ldquo;He said&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Old Mr. Neave sighed, got up, and putting one hand under his beard, he took the
comb from young Charles, and carefully combed the white beard over. Charles
gave him a folded handkerchief, his watch and seals, and spectacle case.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That will do, my lad.&rdquo; The door shut, he sank back, he was
alone....
</p>

<p>
And now that little ancient fellow was climbing down endless flights that led
to a glittering, gay dining-room. What legs he had! They were like a
spider&rsquo;s&mdash;thin, withered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an ideal family, sir, an ideal family.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But if that were true, why didn&rsquo;t Charlotte or the girls stop him? Why
was he all alone, climbing up and down? Where was Harold? Ah, it was no good
expecting anything from Harold. Down, down went the little old spider, and
then, to his horror, old Mr. Neave saw him slip past the dining-room and make
for the porch, the dark drive, the carriage gates, the office. Stop him, stop
him, somebody!
</p>

<p>
Old Mr. Neave started up. It was dark in his dressing-room; the window shone
pale. How long had he been asleep? He listened, and through the big, airy,
darkened house there floated far-away voices, far-away sounds. Perhaps, he
thought vaguely, he had been asleep for a long time. He&rsquo;d been forgotten.
What had all this to do with him&mdash;this house and Charlotte, the girls and
Harold&mdash;what did he know about them? They were strangers to him. Life had
passed him by. Charlotte was not his wife. His wife!
</p>

<p>
... A dark porch, half hidden by a passion-vine, that drooped sorrowful,
mournful, as though it understood. Small, warm arms were round his neck. A
face, little and pale, lifted to his, and a voice breathed, &ldquo;Good-bye, my
treasure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
My treasure! &ldquo;Good-bye, my treasure!&rdquo; Which of them had spoken? Why
had they said good-bye? There had been some terrible mistake. <i>She</i> was
his wife, that little pale girl, and all the rest of his life had been a dream.
</p>

<p>
Then the door opened, and young Charles, standing in the light, put his hands
by his side and shouted like a young soldier, &ldquo;Dinner is on the table,
sir!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming, I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; said old Mr. Neave.
</p>

<p>
<br /><br /><br /><br />
</p>

<p><a name="chap15"></a></p> <h2>The Lady&rsquo;s Maid</h2>

<p>
<i>Eleven o&rsquo;clock. A knock at the door.</i>
</p>

<p>
... I hope I haven&rsquo;t disturbed you, madam. You weren&rsquo;t
asleep&mdash;were you? But I&rsquo;ve just given my lady her tea, and there was
such a nice cup over, I thought, perhaps....
</p>

<p>
... Not at all, madam. I always make a cup of tea last thing. She drinks it in
bed after her prayers to warm her up. I put the kettle on when she kneels down
and I say to it, &ldquo;Now you needn&rsquo;t be in too much of a hurry to say
<i>your</i> prayers.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s always boiling before my lady is
half through. You see, madam, we know such a lot of people, and they&rsquo;ve
all got to be prayed for&mdash;every one. My lady keeps a list of the names in
a little red book. Oh dear! whenever some one new has been to see us and my
lady says afterwards, &ldquo;Ellen, give me my little red book,&rdquo; I feel
quite wild, I do. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another,&rdquo; I think, &ldquo;keeping
her out of her bed in all weathers.&rdquo; And she won&rsquo;t have a cushion,
you know, madam; she kneels on the hard carpet. It fidgets me something
dreadful to see her, knowing her as I do. I&rsquo;ve tried to cheat her;
I&rsquo;ve spread out the eiderdown. But the first time I did it&mdash;oh, she
gave me such a look&mdash;holy it was, madam. &ldquo;Did our Lord have an
eiderdown, Ellen?&rdquo; she said. But&mdash;I was younger at the time&mdash;I
felt inclined to say, &ldquo;No, but our Lord wasn&rsquo;t your age, and he
didn&rsquo;t know what it was to have your lumbago.&rdquo;
Wicked&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it? But she&rsquo;s <i>too</i> good, you know, madam.
When I tucked her up just now and seen&mdash;saw her lying back, her hands
outside and her head on the pillow&mdash;so pretty&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t help
thinking, &ldquo;Now you look just like your dear mother when I laid her
out!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
... Yes, madam, it was all left to me. Oh, she did look sweet. I did her hair,
soft-like, round her forehead, all in dainty curls, and just to one side of her
neck I put a bunch of most beautiful purple pansies. Those pansies made a
picture of her, madam! I shall never forget them. I thought to-night, when I
looked at my lady, &ldquo;Now, if only the pansies was there no one could tell
the difference.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
... Only the last year, madam. Only after she&rsquo;d got a
little&mdash;well&mdash;feeble as you might say. Of course, she was never
dangerous; she was the sweetest old lady. But how it took her was&mdash;she
thought she&rsquo;d lost something. She couldn&rsquo;t keep still, she
couldn&rsquo;t settle. All day long she&rsquo;d be up and down, up and down;
you&rsquo;d meet her everywhere,&mdash;on the stairs, in the porch, making for
the kitchen. And she&rsquo;d look up at you, and she&rsquo;d say&mdash;just
like a child, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost it, I&rsquo;ve lost it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come
along,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;come along, and I&rsquo;ll lay out your
patience for you.&rdquo; But she&rsquo;d catch me by the hand&mdash;I was a
favourite of hers&mdash;and whisper, &ldquo;Find it for me, Ellen. Find it for
me.&rdquo; Sad, wasn&rsquo;t it?
</p>

<p>
... No, she never recovered, madam. She had a stroke at the end. Last words she
ever said was&mdash;very slow, &ldquo;Look
in&mdash;the&mdash;Look&mdash;in&mdash;&rdquo; And then she was gone.
</p>

<p>
... No, madam, I can&rsquo;t say I noticed it. Perhaps some girls. But you see,
it&rsquo;s like this, I&rsquo;ve got nobody but my lady. My mother died of
consumption when I was four, and I lived with my grandfather, who kept a
hair-dresser&rsquo;s shop. I used to spend all my time in the shop under a
table dressing my doll&rsquo;s hair&mdash;copying the assistants, I suppose.
They were ever so kind to me. Used to make me little wigs, all colours, the
latest fashions and all. And there I&rsquo;d sit all day, quiet as
quiet&mdash;the customers never knew. Only now and again I&rsquo;d take my peep
from under the table-cloth.
</p>

<p>
... But one day I managed to get a pair of scissors and&mdash;would you believe
it, madam? I cut off all my hair; snipped it off all in bits, like the little
monkey I was. Grandfather was <i>furious</i>! He caught hold of the
tongs&mdash;I shall never forget it&mdash;grabbed me by the hand and shut my
fingers in them. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll teach you!&rdquo; he said. It was a
fearful burn. I&rsquo;ve got the mark of it to-day.
</p>

<p>
... Well, you see, madam, he&rsquo;d taken such pride in my hair. He used to
sit me up on the counter, before the customers came, and do it something
beautiful&mdash;big, soft curls and waved over the top. I remember the
assistants standing round, and me ever so solemn with the penny grandfather
gave me to hold while it was being done.... But he always took the penny back
afterwards. Poor grandfather! Wild, he was, at the fright I&rsquo;d made of
myself. But he frightened me that time. Do you know what I did, madam? I ran
away. Yes, I did, round the corners, in and out, I don&rsquo;t know how far I
didn&rsquo;t run. Oh, dear, I must have looked a sight, with my hand rolled up
in my pinny and my hair sticking out. People must have laughed when they saw
me....
</p>

<p>
... No, madam, grandfather never got over it. He couldn&rsquo;t bear the sight
of me after. Couldn&rsquo;t eat his dinner, even, if I was there. So my aunt
took me. She was a cripple, an upholstress. Tiny! She had to stand on the sofas
when she wanted to cut out the backs. And it was helping her I met my lady....
</p>

<p>
... Not so very, madam. I was thirteen, turned. And I don&rsquo;t remember ever
feeling&mdash;well&mdash;a child, as you might say. You see there was my
uniform, and one thing and another. My lady put me into collars and cuffs from
the first. Oh yes&mdash;once I did! That was&mdash;funny! It was like this. My
lady had her two little nieces staying with her&mdash;we were at Sheldon at the
time&mdash;and there was a fair on the common.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, Ellen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want you to take the two young
ladies for a ride on the donkeys.&rdquo; Off we went; solemn little loves they
were; each had a hand. But when we came to the donkeys they were too shy to go
on. So we stood and watched instead. Beautiful those donkeys were! They were
the first I&rsquo;d seen out of a cart&mdash;for pleasure as you might say.
They were a lovely silver-grey, with little red saddles and blue bridles and
bells jing-a-jingling on their ears. And quite big girls&mdash;older than me,
even&mdash;were riding them, ever so gay. Not at all common, I don&rsquo;t
mean, madam, just enjoying themselves. And I don&rsquo;t know what it was, but
the way the little feet went, and the eyes&mdash;so gentle&mdash;and the soft
ears&mdash;made me want to go on a donkey more than anything in the world!
</p>

<p>
... Of course, I couldn&rsquo;t. I had my young ladies. And what would I have
looked like perched up there in my uniform? But all the rest of the day it was
donkeys&mdash;donkeys on the brain with me. I felt I should have burst if I
didn&rsquo;t tell some one; and who was there to tell? But when I went to
bed&mdash;I was sleeping in Mrs. James&rsquo;s bedroom, our cook that was, at
the time&mdash;as soon as the lights was out, there they were, my donkeys,
jingling along, with their neat little feet and sad eyes.... Well, madam, would
you believe it, I waited for a long time and pretended to be asleep, and then
suddenly I sat up and called out as loud as I could, &ldquo;<i>I do want to go
on a donkey. I do want a donkey-ride!</i>&rdquo; You see, I had to say it, and
I thought they wouldn&rsquo;t laugh at me if they knew I was only dreaming.
Artful&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it? Just what a silly child would think....
</p>

<p>
... No, madam, never now. Of course, I did think of it at one time. But it
wasn&rsquo;t to be. He had a little flower-shop just down the road and across
from where we was living. Funny&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it? And me such a one for
flowers. We were having a lot of company at the time, and I was in and out of
the shop more often than not, as the saying is. And Harry and I (his name was
Harry) got to quarrelling about how things ought to be arranged&mdash;and that
began it. Flowers! you wouldn&rsquo;t believe it, madam, the flowers he used to
bring me. He&rsquo;d stop at nothing. It was lilies-of-the-valley more than
once, and I&rsquo;m not exaggerating! Well, of course, we were going to be
married and live over the shop, and it was all going to be just so, and I was
to have the window to arrange.... Oh, how I&rsquo;ve done that window of a
Saturday! Not really, of course, madam, just dreaming, as you might say.
I&rsquo;ve done it for Christmas&mdash;motto in holly, and all&mdash;and
I&rsquo;ve had my Easter lilies with a gorgeous star all daffodils in the
middle. I&rsquo;ve hung&mdash;well, that&rsquo;s enough of that. The day came
he was to call for me to choose the furniture. Shall I ever forget it? It was a
Tuesday. My lady wasn&rsquo;t quite herself that afternoon. Not that
she&rsquo;d said anything, of course; she never does or will. But I knew by the
way that she kept wrapping herself up and asking me if it was cold&mdash;and
her little nose looked... pinched. I didn&rsquo;t like leaving her; I knew
I&rsquo;d be worrying all the time. At last I asked her if she&rsquo;d rather I
put it off. &ldquo;Oh no, Ellen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t mind
about me. You mustn&rsquo;t disappoint your young man.&rdquo; And so cheerful,
you know, madam, never thinking about herself. It made me feel worse than ever.
I began to wonder... then she dropped her handkerchief and began to stoop down
to pick it up herself&mdash;a thing she never did. &ldquo;Whatever are you
doing!&rdquo; I cried, running to stop her. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said,
smiling, you know, madam, &ldquo;I shall have to begin to practise.&rdquo; Oh,
it was all I could do not to burst out crying. I went over to the
dressing-table and made believe to rub up the silver, and I couldn&rsquo;t keep
myself in, and I asked her if she&rsquo;d rather I... didn&rsquo;t get married.
&ldquo;No, Ellen,&rdquo; she said&mdash;that was her voice, madam, like
I&rsquo;m giving you&mdash;&ldquo;No, Ellen, not for the <i>wide
world</i>!&rdquo; But while she said it, madam&mdash;I was looking in her
glass; of course, she didn&rsquo;t know I could see her&mdash;she put her
little hand on her heart just like her dear mother used to, and lifted her
eyes... Oh, <i>madam</i>!
</p>

<p>
When Harry came I had his letters all ready, and the ring and a ducky little
brooch he&rsquo;d given me&mdash;a silver bird it was, with a chain in its
beak, and on the end of the chain a heart with a dagger. Quite the thing! I
opened the door to him. I never gave him time for a word. &ldquo;There you
are,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Take them all back,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
all over. I&rsquo;m not going to marry you,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
leave my lady.&rdquo; White! he turned as white as a woman. I had to slam the
door, and there I stood, all of a tremble, till I knew he had gone. When I
opened the door&mdash;believe me or not, madam&mdash;that man <i>was</i> gone!
I ran out into the road just as I was, in my apron and my house-shoes, and
there I stayed in the middle of the road... staring. People must have laughed
if they saw me....
</p>

<p>
... Goodness gracious!&mdash;What&rsquo;s that? It&rsquo;s the clock striking!
And here I&rsquo;ve been keeping you awake. Oh, madam, you ought to have
stopped me.... Can I tuck in your feet? I always tuck in my lady&rsquo;s feet,
every night, just the same. And she says, &ldquo;Good night, Ellen. Sleep sound
and wake early!&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know what I should do if she didn&rsquo;t
say that, now.
</p>

<p>
... Oh dear, I sometimes think... whatever should I do if anything were to....
But, there, thinking&rsquo;s no good to anyone&mdash;is it, madam? Thinking
won&rsquo;t help. Not that I do it often. And if ever I do I pull myself up
sharp, &ldquo;Now, then, Ellen. At it again&mdash;you silly girl! If you
can&rsquo;t find anything better to do than to start thinking!...&rdquo;

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
