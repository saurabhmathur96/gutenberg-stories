A MOTHER

 Mr Holohan, assistant secretary of the Eire Abu Society, had been
walking up and down Dublin for nearly a month, with his hands and pockets full
of dirty pieces of paper, arranging about the series of concerts. He had a game
leg and for this his friends called him Hoppy Holohan. He walked up and down
constantly, stood by the hour at street corners arguing the point and made
notes; but in the end it was Mrs Kearney who arranged everything.

 Miss Devlin had become Mrs Kearney out of spite. She had been educated in a
high-class convent, where she had learned French and music. As she was
naturally pale and unbending in manner she made few friends at school. When she
came to the age of marriage she was sent out to many houses where her playing
and ivory manners were much admired. She sat amid the chilly circle of her
accomplishments, waiting for some suitor to brave it and offer her a brilliant
life. But the young men whom she met were ordinary and she gave them no
encouragement, trying to console her romantic desires by eating a great deal of
Turkish Delight in secret. However, when she drew near the limit and her
friends began to loosen their tongues about her, she silenced them by marrying
Mr Kearney, who was a bootmaker on Ormond Quay.

 He was much older than she. His conversation, which was serious, took place at
intervals in his great brown beard. After the first year of married life, Mrs
Kearney perceived that such a man would wear better than a romantic person, but
she never put her own romantic ideas away. He was sober, thrifty and pious; he
went to the altar every first Friday, sometimes with her, oftener by himself.
But she never weakened in her religion and was a good wife to him. At some
party in a strange house when she lifted her eyebrow ever so slightly he stood
up to take his leave and, when his cough troubled him, she put the eider-down
quilt over his feet and made a strong rum punch. For his part, he was a model
father. By paying a small sum every week into a society, he ensured for both
his daughters a dowry of one hundred pounds each when they came to the age of
twenty-four. He sent the elder daughter, Kathleen, to a good convent, where she
learned French and music, and afterward paid her fees at the Academy. Every
year in the month of July Mrs Kearney found occasion to say to some friend:

 “My good man is packing us off to Skerries for a few weeks.”

 If it was not Skerries it was Howth or Greystones.

 When the Irish Revival began to be appreciable Mrs Kearney determined to take
advantage of her daughter’s name and brought an Irish teacher to the
house. Kathleen and her sister sent Irish picture postcards to their friends
and these friends sent back other Irish picture postcards. On special Sundays,
when Mr Kearney went with his family to the pro-cathedral, a little crowd of
people would assemble after mass at the corner of Cathedral Street. They were
all friends of the Kearneys—musical friends or Nationalist friends; and,
when they had played every little counter of gossip, they shook hands with one
another all together, laughing at the crossing of so many hands, and said
good-bye to one another in Irish. Soon the name of Miss Kathleen Kearney began
to be heard often on people’s lips. People said that she was very clever
at music and a very nice girl and, moreover, that she was a believer in the
language movement. Mrs Kearney was well content at this. Therefore she was not
surprised when one day Mr Holohan came to her and proposed that her daughter
should be the accompanist at a series of four grand concerts which his Society
was going to give in the Antient Concert Rooms. She brought him into the
drawing-room, made him sit down and brought out the decanter and the silver
biscuit-barrel. She entered heart and soul into the details of the enterprise,
advised and dissuaded; and finally a contract was drawn up by which Kathleen
was to receive eight guineas for her services as accompanist at the four grand
concerts.

 As Mr Holohan was a novice in such delicate matters as the wording of bills and
the disposing of items for a programme, Mrs Kearney helped him. She had tact.
She knew what artistes should go into capitals and what artistes should go into small type. She knew that the first tenor would not like to come
on after Mr Meade’s comic turn. To keep the audience continually diverted
she slipped the doubtful items in between the old favourites. Mr Holohan called
to see her every day to have her advice on some point. She was invariably
friendly and advising—homely, in fact. She pushed the decanter towards
him, saying:

 “Now, help yourself, Mr Holohan!”

 And while he was helping himself she said:

 “Don’t be afraid! Don’t be afraid of it!”

 Everything went on smoothly. Mrs Kearney bought some lovely blush-pink
charmeuse in Brown Thomas’s to let into the front of Kathleen’s
dress. It cost a pretty penny; but there are occasions when a little expense is
justifiable. She took a dozen of two-shilling tickets for the final concert and
sent them to those friends who could not be trusted to come otherwise. She
forgot nothing and, thanks to her, everything that was to be done was done.

 The concerts were to be on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. When Mrs
Kearney arrived with her daughter at the Antient Concert Rooms on Wednesday
night she did not like the look of things. A few young men, wearing bright blue
badges in their coats, stood idle in the vestibule; none of them wore evening
dress. She passed by with her daughter and a quick glance through the open door
of the hall showed her the cause of the stewards’ idleness. At first she
wondered had she mistaken the hour. No, it was twenty minutes to eight.

 In the dressing-room behind the stage she was introduced to the secretary of
the Society, Mr Fitzpatrick. She smiled and shook his hand. He was a little
man, with a white vacant face. She noticed that he wore his soft brown hat
carelessly on the side of his head and that his accent was flat. He held a
programme in his hand and, while he was talking to her, he chewed one end of it
into a moist pulp. He seemed to bear disappointments lightly. Mr Holohan came
into the dressing-room every few minutes with reports from the box-office. The artistes talked among themselves nervously, glanced from time to time at
the mirror and rolled and unrolled their music. When it was nearly half-past
eight, the few people in the hall began to express their desire to be
entertained. Mr Fitzpatrick came in, smiled vacantly at the room, and said:

 “Well now, ladies and gentlemen. I suppose we’d better open the
ball.”

 Mrs Kearney rewarded his very flat final syllable with a quick stare of
contempt, and then said to her daughter encouragingly:

 “Are you ready, dear?”

 When she had an opportunity, she called Mr Holohan aside and asked him to tell
her what it meant. Mr Holohan did not know what it meant. He said that the
Committee had made a mistake in arranging for four concerts: four was too many.

 “And the artistes !” said Mrs Kearney. “Of course they
are doing their best, but really they are not good.”

 Mr Holohan admitted that the artistes were no good but the Committee, he
said, had decided to let the first three concerts go as they pleased and
reserve all the talent for Saturday night. Mrs Kearney said nothing, but, as
the mediocre items followed one another on the platform and the few people in
the hall grew fewer and fewer, she began to regret that she had put herself to
any expense for such a concert. There was something she didn’t like in
the look of things and Mr Fitzpatrick’s vacant smile irritated her very
much. However, she said nothing and waited to see how it would end. The concert
expired shortly before ten, and everyone went home quickly.

 The concert on Thursday night was better attended, but Mrs Kearney saw at once
that the house was filled with paper. The audience behaved indecorously, as if
the concert were an informal dress rehearsal. Mr Fitzpatrick seemed to enjoy
himself; he was quite unconscious that Mrs Kearney was taking angry note of his
conduct. He stood at the edge of the screen, from time to time jutting out his
head and exchanging a laugh with two friends in the corner of the balcony. In
the course of the evening, Mrs Kearney learned that the Friday concert was to
be abandoned and that the Committee was going to move heaven and earth to
secure a bumper house on Saturday night. When she heard this, she sought out Mr
Holohan. She buttonholed him as he was limping out quickly with a glass of
lemonade for a young lady and asked him was it true. Yes, it was true.

 “But, of course, that doesn’t alter the contract,” she said.
“The contract was for four concerts.”

 Mr Holohan seemed to be in a hurry; he advised her to speak to Mr Fitzpatrick.
Mrs Kearney was now beginning to be alarmed. She called Mr Fitzpatrick away
from his screen and told him that her daughter had signed for four concerts and
that, of course, according to the terms of the contract, she should receive the
sum originally stipulated for, whether the society gave the four concerts or
not. Mr Fitzpatrick, who did not catch the point at issue very quickly, seemed
unable to resolve the difficulty and said that he would bring the matter before
the Committee. Mrs Kearney’s anger began to flutter in her cheek and she
had all she could do to keep from asking:

 “And who is the Cometty pray?”

 But she knew that it would not be ladylike to do that: so she was silent.

 Little boys were sent out into the principal streets of Dublin early on Friday
morning with bundles of handbills. Special puffs appeared in all the evening
papers, reminding the music-loving public of the treat which was in store for
it on the following evening. Mrs Kearney was somewhat reassured, but she
thought well to tell her husband part of her suspicions. He listened carefully
and said that perhaps it would be better if he went with her on Saturday night.
She agreed. She respected her husband in the same way as she respected the
General Post Office, as something large, secure and fixed; and though she knew
the small number of his talents she appreciated his abstract value as a male.
She was glad that he had suggested coming with her. She thought her plans over.

 The night of the grand concert came. Mrs Kearney, with her husband and
daughter, arrived at the Antient Concert Rooms three-quarters of an hour before
the time at which the concert was to begin. By ill luck it was a rainy evening.
Mrs Kearney placed her daughter’s clothes and music in charge of her
husband and went all over the building looking for Mr Holohan or Mr
Fitzpatrick. She could find neither. She asked the stewards was any member of
the Committee in the hall and, after a great deal of trouble, a steward brought
out a little woman named Miss Beirne to whom Mrs Kearney explained that she
wanted to see one of the secretaries. Miss Beirne expected them any minute and
asked could she do anything. Mrs Kearney looked searchingly at the oldish face
which was screwed into an expression of trustfulness and enthusiasm and
answered:

 “No, thank you!”

 The little woman hoped they would have a good house. She looked out at the rain
until the melancholy of the wet street effaced all the trustfulness and
enthusiasm from her twisted features. Then she gave a little sigh and said:

 “Ah, well! We did our best, the dear knows.”

 Mrs Kearney had to go back to the dressing-room.

 The artistes were arriving. The bass and the second tenor had already
come. The bass, Mr Duggan, was a slender young man with a scattered black
moustache. He was the son of a hall porter in an office in the city and, as a
boy, he had sung prolonged bass notes in the resounding hall. From this humble
state he had raised himself until he had become a first-rate artiste . He
had appeared in grand opera. One night, when an operatic artiste had
fallen ill, he had undertaken the part of the king in the opera of Maritana at the Queen’s Theatre. He sang his music with great
feeling and volume and was warmly welcomed by the gallery; but, unfortunately,
he marred the good impression by wiping his nose in his gloved hand once or
twice out of thoughtlessness. He was unassuming and spoke little. He said yous so softly that it passed unnoticed and he never drank anything
stronger than milk for his voice’s sake. Mr Bell, the second tenor, was a
fair-haired little man who competed every year for prizes at the Feis Ceoil. On
his fourth trial he had been awarded a bronze medal. He was extremely nervous
and extremely jealous of other tenors and he covered his nervous jealousy with
an ebullient friendliness. It was his humour to have people know what an ordeal
a concert was to him. Therefore when he saw Mr Duggan he went over to him and
asked:

 “Are you in it too?”

 “Yes,” said Mr Duggan.

 Mr Bell laughed at his fellow-sufferer, held out his hand and said:

 “Shake!”

 Mrs Kearney passed by these two young men and went to the edge of the screen to
view the house. The seats were being filled up rapidly and a pleasant noise
circulated in the auditorium. She came back and spoke to her husband privately.
Their conversation was evidently about Kathleen for they both glanced at her
often as she stood chatting to one of her Nationalist friends, Miss Healy, the
contralto. An unknown solitary woman with a pale face walked through the room.
The women followed with keen eyes the faded blue dress which was stretched upon
a meagre body. Someone said that she was Madam Glynn, the soprano.

 “I wonder where did they dig her up,” said Kathleen to Miss Healy.
“I’m sure I never heard of her.”

 Miss Healy had to smile. Mr Holohan limped into the dressing-room at that
moment and the two young ladies asked him who was the unknown woman. Mr Holohan
said that she was Madam Glynn from London. Madam Glynn took her stand in a
corner of the room, holding a roll of music stiffly before her and from time to
time changing the direction of her startled gaze. The shadow took her faded
dress into shelter but fell revengefully into the little cup behind her
collar-bone. The noise of the hall became more audible. The first tenor and the
baritone arrived together. They were both well dressed, stout and complacent
and they brought a breath of opulence among the company.

 Mrs Kearney brought her daughter over to them, and talked to them amiably. She
wanted to be on good terms with them but, while she strove to be polite, her
eyes followed Mr Holohan in his limping and devious courses. As soon as she
could she excused herself and went out after him.

 “Mr Holohan, I want to speak to you for a moment,” she said.

 They went down to a discreet part of the corridor. Mrs Kearney asked him when
was her daughter going to be paid. Mr Holohan said that Mr Fitzpatrick had
charge of that. Mrs Kearney said that she didn’t know anything about Mr
Fitzpatrick. Her daughter had signed a contract for eight guineas and she would
have to be paid. Mr Holohan said that it wasn’t his business.

 “Why isn’t it your business?” asked Mrs Kearney.
“Didn’t you yourself bring her the contract? Anyway, if it’s
not your business it’s my business and I mean to see to it.”

 “You’d better speak to Mr Fitzpatrick,” said Mr Holohan
distantly.

 “I don’t know anything about Mr Fitzpatrick,” repeated Mrs
Kearney. “I have my contract, and I intend to see that it is carried
out.”

 When she came back to the dressing-room her cheeks were slightly suffused. The
room was lively. Two men in outdoor dress had taken possession of the fireplace
and were chatting familiarly with Miss Healy and the baritone. They were the Freeman man and Mr O’Madden Burke. The Freeman man had come
in to say that he could not wait for the concert as he had to report the
lecture which an American priest was giving in the Mansion House. He said they
were to leave the report for him at the Freeman office and he would see
that it went in. He was a grey-haired man, with a plausible voice and careful
manners. He held an extinguished cigar in his hand and the aroma of cigar smoke
floated near him. He had not intended to stay a moment because concerts and artistes bored him considerably but he remained leaning against the
mantelpiece. Miss Healy stood in front of him, talking and laughing. He was old
enough to suspect one reason for her politeness but young enough in spirit to
turn the moment to account. The warmth, fragrance and colour of her body
appealed to his senses. He was pleasantly conscious that the bosom which he saw
rise and fall slowly beneath him rose and fell at that moment for him, that the
laughter and fragrance and wilful glances were his tribute. When he could stay
no longer he took leave of her regretfully.

 “O’Madden Burke will write the notice,” he explained to Mr
Holohan, “and I’ll see it in.”

 “Thank you very much, Mr Hendrick,” said Mr Holohan,
“you’ll see it in, I know. Now, won’t you have a little
something before you go?”

 “I don’t mind,” said Mr Hendrick.

 The two men went along some tortuous passages and up a dark staircase and came
to a secluded room where one of the stewards was uncorking bottles for a few
gentlemen. One of these gentlemen was Mr O’Madden Burke, who had found
out the room by instinct. He was a suave, elderly man who balanced his imposing
body, when at rest, upon a large silk umbrella. His magniloquent western name
was the moral umbrella upon which he balanced the fine problem of his finances.
He was widely respected.

 While Mr Holohan was entertaining the Freeman man Mrs Kearney was
speaking so animatedly to her husband that he had to ask her to lower her
voice. The conversation of the others in the dressing-room had become strained.
Mr Bell, the first item, stood ready with his music but the accompanist made no
sign. Evidently something was wrong. Mr Kearney looked straight before him,
stroking his beard, while Mrs Kearney spoke into Kathleen’s ear with
subdued emphasis. From the hall came sounds of encouragement, clapping and
stamping of feet. The first tenor and the baritone and Miss Healy stood
together, waiting tranquilly, but Mr Bell’s nerves were greatly agitated
because he was afraid the audience would think that he had come late.

 Mr Holohan and Mr O’Madden Burke came into the room. In a moment Mr
Holohan perceived the hush. He went over to Mrs Kearney and spoke with her
earnestly. While they were speaking the noise in the hall grew louder. Mr
Holohan became very red and excited. He spoke volubly, but Mrs Kearney said
curtly at intervals:

 “She won’t go on. She must get her eight guineas.”

 Mr Holohan pointed desperately towards the hall where the audience was clapping
and stamping. He appealed to Mr Kearney and to Kathleen. But Mr Kearney
continued to stroke his beard and Kathleen looked down, moving the point of her
new shoe: it was not her fault. Mrs Kearney repeated:

 “She won’t go on without her money.”

 After a swift struggle of tongues Mr Holohan hobbled out in haste. The room was
silent. When the strain of the silence had become somewhat painful Miss Healy
said to the baritone:

 “Have you seen Mrs Pat Campbell this week?”

 The baritone had not seen her but he had been told that she was very fine. The
conversation went no further. The first tenor bent his head and began to count
the links of the gold chain which was extended across his waist, smiling and
humming random notes to observe the effect on the frontal sinus. From time to
time everyone glanced at Mrs Kearney.

 The noise in the auditorium had risen to a clamour when Mr Fitzpatrick burst
into the room, followed by Mr Holohan, who was panting. The clapping and
stamping in the hall were punctuated by whistling. Mr Fitzpatrick held a few
banknotes in his hand. He counted out four into Mrs Kearney’s hand and
said she would get the other half at the interval. Mrs Kearney said:

 “This is four shillings short.”

 But Kathleen gathered in her skirt and said: “Now, Mr Bell,” to the first item, who was shaking like an aspen. The singer and the
accompanist went out together. The noise in hall died away. There was a pause
of a few seconds: and then the piano was heard.

 The first part of the concert was very successful except for Madam
Glynn’s item. The poor lady sang Killarney in a bodiless gasping
voice, with all the old-fashioned mannerisms of intonation and pronunciation
which she believed lent elegance to her singing. She looked as if she had been
resurrected from an old stage-wardrobe and the cheaper parts of the hall made
fun of her high wailing notes. The first tenor and the contralto, however,
brought down the house. Kathleen played a selection of Irish airs which was
generously applauded. The first part closed with a stirring patriotic
recitation delivered by a young lady who arranged amateur theatricals. It was
deservedly applauded; and, when it was ended, the men went out for the
interval, content.

 All this time the dressing-room was a hive of excitement. In one corner were Mr
Holohan, Mr Fitzpatrick, Miss Beirne, two of the stewards, the baritone, the
bass, and Mr O’Madden Burke. Mr O’Madden Burke said it was the most
scandalous exhibition he had ever witnessed. Miss Kathleen Kearney’s
musical career was ended in Dublin after that, he said. The baritone was asked
what did he think of Mrs Kearney’s conduct. He did not like to say
anything. He had been paid his money and wished to be at peace with men.
However, he said that Mrs Kearney might have taken the artistes into
consideration. The stewards and the secretaries debated hotly as to what should
be done when the interval came.

 “I agree with Miss Beirne,” said Mr O’Madden Burke.
“Pay her nothing.”

 In another corner of the room were Mrs Kearney and her husband, Mr Bell, Miss
Healy and the young lady who had to recite the patriotic piece. Mrs Kearney
said that the Committee had treated her scandalously. She had spared neither
trouble nor expense and this was how she was repaid.

 They thought they had only a girl to deal with and that, therefore, they could
ride roughshod over her. But she would show them their mistake. They
wouldn’t have dared to have treated her like that if she had been a man.
But she would see that her daughter got her rights: she wouldn’t be
fooled. If they didn’t pay her to the last farthing she would make Dublin
ring. Of course she was sorry for the sake of the artistes . But what
else could she do? She appealed to the second tenor who said he thought she had
not been well treated. Then she appealed to Miss Healy. Miss Healy wanted to
join the other group but she did not like to do so because she was a great
friend of Kathleen’s and the Kearneys had often invited her to their
house.

 As soon as the first part was ended Mr Fitzpatrick and Mr Holohan went over to
Mrs Kearney and told her that the other four guineas would be paid after the
Committee meeting on the following Tuesday and that, in case her daughter did
not play for the second part, the Committee would consider the contract broken
and would pay nothing.

 “I haven’t seen any Committee,” said Mrs Kearney angrily.
“My daughter has her contract. She will get four pounds eight into her
hand or a foot she won’t put on that platform.”

 “I’m surprised at you, Mrs Kearney,” said Mr Holohan.
“I never thought you would treat us this way.”

 “And what way did you treat me?” asked Mrs Kearney.

 Her face was inundated with an angry colour and she looked as if she would
attack someone with her hands.

 “I’m asking for my rights.” she said.

 “You might have some sense of decency,” said Mr Holohan.

 “Might I, indeed?... And when I ask when my daughter is going to be paid
I can’t get a civil answer.”

 She tossed her head and assumed a haughty voice:

 “You must speak to the secretary. It’s not my business. I’m a
great fellow fol-the-diddle-I-do.”

 “I thought you were a lady,” said Mr Holohan, walking away from her
abruptly.

 After that Mrs Kearney’s conduct was condemned on all hands: everyone
approved of what the Committee had done. She stood at the door, haggard with
rage, arguing with her husband and daughter, gesticulating with them. She
waited until it was time for the second part to begin in the hope that the
secretaries would approach her. But Miss Healy had kindly consented to play one
or two accompaniments. Mrs Kearney had to stand aside to allow the baritone and
his accompanist to pass up to the platform. She stood still for an instant like
an angry stone image and, when the first notes of the song struck her ear, she
caught up her daughter’s cloak and said to her husband:

 “Get a cab!”

 He went out at once. Mrs Kearney wrapped the cloak round her daughter and
followed him. As she passed through the doorway she stopped and glared into Mr
Holohan’s face.

 “I’m not done with you yet,” she said.

 “But I’m done with you,” said Mr Holohan.

 Kathleen followed her mother meekly. Mr Holohan began to pace up and down the
room, in order to cool himself for he felt his skin on fire.

 “That’s a nice lady!” he said. “O, she’s a nice
lady!”

 “You did the proper thing, Holohan,” said Mr O’Madden Burke,
poised upon his umbrella in approval.
