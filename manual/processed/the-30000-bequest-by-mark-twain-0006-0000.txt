THE $30,000 BEQUEST

  

  









 CHAPTER I

 Lakeside was a pleasant little town of five or six thousand inhabitants,
      and a rather pretty one, too, as towns go in the Far West. It had church
      accommodations for thirty-five thousand, which is the way of the Far West
      and the South, where everybody is religious, and where each of the
      Protestant sects is represented and has a plant of its own. Rank was
      unknown in Lakeside—unconfessed, anyway; everybody knew everybody
      and his dog, and a sociable friendliness was the prevailing atmosphere.

 Saladin Foster was book-keeper in the principal store, and the only
      high-salaried man of his profession in Lakeside. He was thirty-five years
      old, now; he had served that store for fourteen years; he had begun in his
      marriage-week at four hundred dollars a year, and had climbed steadily up,
      a hundred dollars a year, for four years; from that time forth his wage
      had remained eight hundred—a handsome figure indeed, and everybody
      conceded that he was worth it.

 His wife, Electra, was a capable helpmeet, although—like himself—a
      dreamer of dreams and a private dabbler in romance. The first thing she
      did, after her marriage—child as she was, aged only nineteen—was
      to buy an acre of ground on the edge of the town, and pay down the cash
      for it—twenty-five dollars, all her fortune. Saladin had less, by
      fifteen. She instituted a vegetable garden there, got it farmed on shares
      by the nearest neighbor, and made it pay her a hundred per cent. a year.
      Out of Saladin's first year's wage she put thirty dollars in the
      savings-bank, sixty out of his second, a hundred out of his third, a
      hundred and fifty out of his fourth. His wage went to eight hundred a
      year, then, and meantime two children had arrived and increased the
      expenses, but she banked two hundred a year from the salary, nevertheless,
      thenceforth. When she had been married seven years she built and furnished
      a pretty and comfortable two-thousand-dollar house in the midst of her
      garden-acre, paid half of the money down and moved her family in. Seven
      years later she was out of debt and had several hundred dollars out
      earning its living.

 Earning it by the rise in landed estate; for she had long ago bought
      another acre or two and sold the most of it at a profit to pleasant people
      who were willing to build, and would be good neighbors and furnish a
      general comradeship for herself and her growing family. She had an
      independent income from safe investments of about a hundred dollars a
      year; her children were growing in years and grace; and she was a pleased
      and happy woman. Happy in her husband, happy in her children, and the
      husband and the children were happy in her. It is at this point that this
      history begins.

 The youngest girl, Clytemnestra—called Clytie for short—was
      eleven; her sister, Gwendolen—called Gwen for short—was
      thirteen; nice girls, and comely. The names betray the latent
      romance-tinge in the parental blood, the parents' names indicate that the
      tinge was an inheritance. It was an affectionate family, hence all four of
      its members had pet names, Saladin's was a curious and unsexing one—Sally;
      and so was Electra's—Aleck. All day long Sally was a good and
      diligent book-keeper and salesman; all day long Aleck was a good and
      faithful mother and housewife, and thoughtful and calculating business
      woman; but in the cozy living-room at night they put the plodding world
      away, and lived in another and a fairer, reading romances to each other,
      dreaming dreams, comrading with kings and princes and stately lords and
      ladies in the flash and stir and splendor of noble palaces and grim and
      ancient castles.

  

  









 CHAPTER II

 Now came great news! Stunning news—joyous news, in fact. It came
      from a neighboring state, where the family's only surviving relative
      lived. It was Sally's relative—a sort of vague and indefinite uncle
      or second or third cousin by the name of Tilbury Foster, seventy and a
      bachelor, reputed well off and corresponding sour and crusty. Sally had
      tried to make up to him once, by letter, in a bygone time, and had not
      made that mistake again. Tilbury now wrote to Sally, saying he should
      shortly die, and should leave him thirty thousand dollars, cash; not for
      love, but because money had given him most of his troubles and
      exasperations, and he wished to place it where there was good hope that it
      would continue its malignant work. The bequest would be found in his will,
      and would be paid over. PROVIDED, that Sally should be able to prove to
      the executors that he had Taken no notice of the gift by spoken word or
      by letter, had made no inquiries concerning the moribund's progress toward
      the everlasting tropics, and had not attended the funeral. 

 As soon as Aleck had partially recovered from the tremendous emotions
      created by the letter, she sent to the relative's habitat and subscribed
      for the local paper.

 Man and wife entered into a solemn compact, now, to never mention the
      great news to any one while the relative lived, lest some ignorant person
      carry the fact to the death-bed and distort it and make it appear that
      they were disobediently thankful for the bequest, and just the same as
      confessing it and publishing it, right in the face of the prohibition.

 For the rest of the day Sally made havoc and confusion with his books, and
      Aleck could not keep her mind on her affairs, not even take up a
      flower-pot or book or a stick of wood without forgetting what she had
      intended to do with it. For both were dreaming.

 “Thir-ty thousand dollars!”

 All day long the music of those inspiring words sang through those
      people's heads.

 From his marriage-day forth, Aleck's grip had been upon the purse, and
      Sally had seldom known what it was to be privileged to squander a dime on
      non-necessities.

 “Thir-ty thousand dollars!” the song went on and on. A vast sum, an
      unthinkable sum!

 All day long Aleck was absorbed in planning how to invest it, Sally in
      planning how to spend it.

 There was no romance-reading that night. The children took themselves away
      early, for their parents were silent, distraught, and strangely
      unentertaining. The good-night kisses might as well have been impressed
      upon vacancy, for all the response they got; the parents were not aware of
      the kisses, and the children had been gone an hour before their absence
      was noticed. Two pencils had been busy during that hour—note-making;
      in the way of plans. It was Sally who broke the stillness at last. He
      said, with exultation:

 “Ah, it'll be grand, Aleck! Out of the first thousand we'll have a horse
      and a buggy for summer, and a cutter and a skin lap-robe for winter.”

 Aleck responded with decision and composure—

 “Out of the capital ? Nothing of the kind. Not if it was a million!”

 Sally was deeply disappointed; the glow went out of his face.

 “Oh, Aleck!” he said, reproachfully. “We've always worked so hard and been
      so scrimped: and now that we are rich, it does seem—”

 He did not finish, for he saw her eye soften; his supplication had touched
      her. She said, with gentle persuasiveness:

 “We must not spend the capital, dear, it would not be wise. Out of the
      income from it—”

 “That will answer, that will answer, Aleck! How dear and good you are!
      There will be a noble income and if we can spend that—”

 “Not all of it, dear, not all of it, but you can spend a part of
      it. That is, a reasonable part. But the whole of the capital—every
      penny of it—must be put right to work, and kept at it. You see the
      reasonableness of that, don't you?”

 “Why, ye-s. Yes, of course. But we'll have to wait so long. Six months
      before the first interest falls due.”

 “Yes—maybe longer.”

 “Longer, Aleck? Why? Don't they pay half-yearly?”

 “ That kind of an investment—yes; but I sha'n't invest in that
      way.”

 “What way, then?”

 “For big returns.”

 “Big. That's good. Go on, Aleck. What is it?”

 “Coal. The new mines. Cannel. I mean to put in ten thousand. Ground floor.
      When we organize, we'll get three shares for one.”

 “By George, but it sounds good, Aleck! Then the shares will be worth—how
      much? And when?”

 “About a year. They'll pay ten per cent. half yearly, and be worth thirty
      thousand. I know all about it; the advertisement is in the Cincinnati
      paper here.”

 “Land, thirty thousand for ten—in a year! Let's jam in the whole
      capital and pull out ninety! I'll write and subscribe right now—tomorrow
      it maybe too late.”

 He was flying to the writing-desk, but Aleck stopped him and put him back
      in his chair. She said:

 “Don't lose your head so. We mustn't subscribe till we've got the
      money; don't you know that?”

 Sally's excitement went down a degree or two, but he was not wholly
      appeased.

 “Why, Aleck, we'll have it, you know—and so soon, too. He's
      probably out of his troubles before this; it's a hundred to nothing he's
      selecting his brimstone-shovel this very minute. Now, I think—”

 Aleck shuddered, and said:

 “How can you, Sally! Don't talk in that way, it is perfectly
      scandalous.”

 “Oh, well, make it a halo, if you like, I don't care for his
      outfit, I was only just talking. Can't you let a person talk?”

 “But why should you want to talk in that dreadful way? How would
      you like to have people talk so about you , and you not cold yet?”

 “Not likely to be, for one while, I reckon, if my last act was
      giving away money for the sake of doing somebody a harm with it. But never
      mind about Tilbury, Aleck, let's talk about something worldly. It does
      seem to me that that mine is the place for the whole thirty. What's the
      objection?”

 “All the eggs in one basket—that's the objection.”

 “All right, if you say so. What about the other twenty? What do you mean
      to do with that?”

 “There is no hurry; I am going to look around before I do anything with
      it.”

 “All right, if your mind's made up,” sighed Sally. He was deep in thought
      awhile, then he said:

 “There'll be twenty thousand profit coming from the ten a year from now.
      We can spend that, can't we, Aleck?”

 Aleck shook her head.

 “No, dear,” she said, “it won't sell high till we've had the first
      semi-annual dividend. You can spend part of that.”

 “Shucks, only that —and a whole year to wait! Confound it, I—”

 “Oh, do be patient! It might even be declared in three months—it's
      quite within the possibilities.”

 “Oh, jolly! oh, thanks!” and Sally jumped up and kissed his wife in
      gratitude. “It'll be three thousand—three whole thousand! how much
      of it can we spend, Aleck? Make it liberal!—do, dear, that's a good
      fellow.”

 Aleck was pleased; so pleased that she yielded to the pressure and
      conceded a sum which her judgment told her was a foolish extravagance—a
      thousand dollars. Sally kissed her half a dozen times and even in that way
      could not express all his joy and thankfulness. This new access of
      gratitude and affection carried Aleck quite beyond the bounds of prudence,
      and before she could restrain herself she had made her darling another
      grant—a couple of thousand out of the fifty or sixty which she meant
      to clear within a year of the twenty which still remained of the bequest.
      The happy tears sprang to Sally's eyes, and he said:

 “Oh, I want to hug you!” And he did it. Then he got his notes and sat down
      and began to check off, for first purchase, the luxuries which he should
      earliest wish to secure. “Horse—buggy—cutter—lap-robe—patent-leathers—dog—plug-hat—
      church-pew—stem-winder—new teeth— say , Aleck!”

 “Well?”

 “Ciphering away, aren't you? That's right. Have you got the twenty
      thousand invested yet?”

 “No, there's no hurry about that; I must look around first, and think.”

 “But you are ciphering; what's it about?”

 “Why, I have to find work for the thirty thousand that comes out of the
      coal, haven't I?”

 “Scott, what a head! I never thought of that. How are you getting along?
      Where have you arrived?”

 “Not very far—two years or three. I've turned it over twice; once in
      oil and once in wheat.”

 “Why, Aleck, it's splendid! How does it aggregate?”

 “I think—well, to be on the safe side, about a hundred and eighty
      thousand clear, though it will probably be more.”

 “My! isn't it wonderful? By gracious! luck has come our way at last, after
      all the hard sledding. Aleck!”

 “Well?”

 “I'm going to cash in a whole three hundred on the missionaries—what
      real right have we care for expenses!”

 “You couldn't do a nobler thing, dear; and it's just like your generous
      nature, you unselfish boy.”

 The praise made Sally poignantly happy, but he was fair and just enough to
      say it was rightfully due to Aleck rather than to himself, since but for
      her he should never have had the money.

 Then they went up to bed, and in their delirium of bliss they forgot and
      left the candle burning in the parlor. They did not remember until they
      were undressed; then Sally was for letting it burn; he said they could
      afford it, if it was a thousand. But Aleck went down and put it out.

 A good job, too; for on her way back she hit on a scheme that would turn
      the hundred and eighty thousand into half a million before it had had time
      to get cold.

  

  









 CHAPTER III

 The little newspaper which Aleck had subscribed for was a Thursday sheet;
      it would make the trip of five hundred miles from Tilbury's village and
      arrive on Saturday. Tilbury's letter had started on Friday, more than a
      day too late for the benefactor to die and get into that week's issue, but
      in plenty of time to make connection for the next output. Thus the Fosters
      had to wait almost a complete week to find out whether anything of a
      satisfactory nature had happened to him or not. It was a long, long week,
      and the strain was a heavy one. The pair could hardly have borne it if
      their minds had not had the relief of wholesome diversion. We have seen
      that they had that. The woman was piling up fortunes right along, the man
      was spending them—spending all his wife would give him a chance at,
      at any rate.

 At last the Saturday came, and the Weekly Sagamore arrived. Mrs.
      Eversly Bennett was present. She was the Presbyterian parson's wife, and
      was working the Fosters for a charity. Talk now died a sudden death—on
      the Foster side. Mrs. Bennett presently discovered that her hosts were not
      hearing a word she was saying; so she got up, wondering and indignant, and
      went away. The moment she was out of the house, Aleck eagerly tore the
      wrapper from the paper, and her eyes and Sally's swept the columns for the
      death-notices. Disappointment! Tilbury was not anywhere mentioned. Aleck
      was a Christian from the cradle, and duty and the force of habit required
      her to go through the motions. She pulled herself together and said, with
      a pious two-per-cent. trade joyousness:

 “Let us be humbly thankful that he has been spared; and—”

 “Damn his treacherous hide, I wish—”

 “Sally! For shame!”

 “I don't care!” retorted the angry man. “It's the way you feel, and
      if you weren't so immorally pious you'd be honest and say so.”

 Aleck said, with wounded dignity:

 “I do not see how you can say such unkind and unjust things. There is no
      such thing as immoral piety.”

 Sally felt a pang, but tried to conceal it under a shuffling attempt to
      save his case by changing the form of it—as if changing the form
      while retaining the juice could deceive the expert he was trying to
      placate. He said:

 “I didn't mean so bad as that, Aleck; I didn't really mean immoral piety,
      I only meant—meant—well, conventional piety, you know; er—shop
      piety; the—the—why, you know what I mean. Aleck—the—well,
      where you put up that plated article and play it for solid, you know,
      without intending anything improper, but just out of trade habit, ancient
      policy, petrified custom, loyalty to—to—hang it, I can't find
      the right words, but you know what I mean, Aleck, and that there
      isn't any harm in it. I'll try again. You see, it's this way. If a person—”

 “You have said quite enough,” said Aleck, coldly; “let the subject be
      dropped.”

 “I'm willing,” fervently responded Sally, wiping the sweat from his
      forehead and looking the thankfulness he had no words for. Then, musingly,
      he apologized to himself. “I certainly held threes— I know it—but
      I drew and didn't fill. That's where I'm so often weak in the game. If I
      had stood pat—but I didn't. I never do. I don't know enough.”

 Confessedly defeated, he was properly tame now and subdued. Aleck forgave
      him with her eyes.

 The grand interest, the supreme interest, came instantly to the front
      again; nothing could keep it in the background many minutes on a stretch.
      The couple took up the puzzle of the absence of Tilbury's death-notice.
      They discussed it every which way, more or less hopefully, but they had to
      finish where they began, and concede that the only really sane explanation
      of the absence of the notice must be—and without doubt was—that
      Tilbury was not dead. There was something sad about it, something even a
      little unfair, maybe, but there it was, and had to be put up with. They
      were agreed as to that. To Sally it seemed a strangely inscrutable
      dispensation; more inscrutable than usual, he thought; one of the most
      unnecessary inscrutable he could call to mind, in fact—and said so,
      with some feeling; but if he was hoping to draw Aleck he failed; she
      reserved her opinion, if she had one; she had not the habit of taking
      injudicious risks in any market, worldly or other.

 The pair must wait for next week's paper—Tilbury had evidently
      postponed. That was their thought and their decision. So they put the
      subject away and went about their affairs again with as good heart as they
      could.

 Now, if they had but known it, they had been wronging Tilbury all the
      time. Tilbury had kept faith, kept it to the letter; he was dead, he had
      died to schedule. He was dead more than four days now and used to it;
      entirely dead, perfectly dead, as dead as any other new person in the
      cemetery; dead in abundant time to get into that week's Sagamore ,
      too, and only shut out by an accident; an accident which could not happen
      to a metropolitan journal, but which happens easily to a poor little
      village rag like the Sagamore . On this occasion, just as the
      editorial page was being locked up, a gratis quart of strawberry ice-water
      arrived from Hostetter's Ladies and Gents Ice-Cream Parlors, and the
      stickful of rather chilly regret over Tilbury's translation got crowded
      out to make room for the editor's frantic gratitude.

 On its way to the standing-galley Tilbury's notice got pied. Otherwise it
      would have gone into some future edition, for weekly Sagamores do
      not waste “live” matter, and in their galleys “live” matter is immortal,
      unless a pi accident intervenes. But a thing that gets pied is dead, and
      for such there is no resurrection; its chance of seeing print is gone,
      forever and ever. And so, let Tilbury like it or not, let him rave in his
      grave to his fill, no matter—no mention of his death would ever see
      the light in the Weekly Sagamore .

  

  









 CHAPTER IV

 Five weeks drifted tediously along. The Sagamore arrived regularly
      on the Saturdays, but never once contained a mention of Tilbury Foster.
      Sally's patience broke down at this point, and he said, resentfully:

 “Damn his livers, he's immortal!”

 Aleck give him a very severe rebuke, and added with icy solemnity:

 “How would you feel if you were suddenly cut off just after such an awful
      remark had escaped out of you?”

 Without sufficient reflection Sally responded:

 “I'd feel I was lucky I hadn't got caught with it in me.”

 Pride had forced him to say something, and as he could not think of any
      rational thing to say he flung that out. Then he stole a base—as he
      called it—that is, slipped from the presence, to keep from being
      brayed in his wife's discussion-mortar.

 Six months came and went. The Sagamore was still silent about
      Tilbury. Meantime, Sally had several times thrown out a feeler—that
      is, a hint that he would like to know. Aleck had ignored the hints. Sally
      now resolved to brace up and risk a frontal attack. So he squarely
      proposed to disguise himself and go to Tilbury's village and
      surreptitiously find out as to the prospects. Aleck put her foot on the
      dangerous project with energy and decision. She said:

 “What can you be thinking of? You do keep my hands full! You have to be
      watched all the time, like a little child, to keep you from walking into
      the fire. You'll stay right where you are!”

 “Why, Aleck, I could do it and not be found out—I'm certain of it.”

 “Sally Foster, don't you know you would have to inquire around?”

 “Of course, but what of it? Nobody would suspect who I was.”

 “Oh, listen to the man! Some day you've got to prove to the executors that
      you never inquired. What then?”

 He had forgotten that detail. He didn't reply; there wasn't anything to
      say. Aleck added:

 “Now then, drop that notion out of your mind, and don't ever meddle with
      it again. Tilbury set that trap for you. Don't you know it's a trap? He is
      on the watch, and fully expecting you to blunder into it. Well, he is
      going to be disappointed—at least while I am on deck. Sally!”

 “Well?”

 “As long as you live, if it's a hundred years, don't you ever make an
      inquiry. Promise!”

 “All right,” with a sigh and reluctantly.

 Then Aleck softened and said:

 “Don't be impatient. We are prospering; we can wait; there is no hurry.
      Our small dead-certain income increases all the time; and as to futures, I
      have not made a mistake yet—they are piling up by the thousands and
      tens of thousands. There is not another family in the state with such
      prospects as ours. Already we are beginning to roll in eventual wealth.
      You know that, don't you?”

 “Yes, Aleck, it's certainly so.”

 “Then be grateful for what God is doing for us and stop worrying. You do
      not believe we could have achieved these prodigious results without His
      special help and guidance, do you?”

 Hesitatingly, “N-no, I suppose not.” Then, with feeling and admiration,
      “And yet, when it comes to judiciousness in watering a stock or putting up
      a hand to skin Wall Street I don't give in that you need any
      outside amateur help, if I do wish I—”

 “Oh, do shut up! I know you do not mean any harm or any
      irreverence, poor boy, but you can't seem to open your mouth without
      letting out things to make a person shudder. You keep me in constant
      dread. For you and for all of us. Once I had no fear of the thunder, but
      now when I hear it I—”

 Her voice broke, and she began to cry, and could not finish. The sight of
      this smote Sally to the heart and he took her in his arms and petted her
      and comforted her and promised better conduct, and upbraided himself and
      remorsefully pleaded for forgiveness. And he was in earnest, and sorry for
      what he had done and ready for any sacrifice that could make up for it.

 And so, in privacy, he thought long and deeply over the matter, resolving
      to do what should seem best. It was easy to promise reform; indeed
      he had already promised it. But would that do any real good, any permanent
      good? No, it would be but temporary—he knew his weakness, and
      confessed it to himself with sorrow—he could not keep the promise.
      Something surer and better must be devised; and he devised it. At cost of
      precious money which he had long been saving up, shilling by shilling, he
      put a lightning-rod on the house.

 At a subsequent time he relapsed.

 What miracles habit can do! and how quickly and how easily habits are
      acquired—both trifling habits and habits which profoundly change us.
      If by accident we wake at two in the morning a couple of nights in
      succession, we have need to be uneasy, for another repetition can turn the
      accident into a habit; and a month's dallying with whiskey—but we
      all know these commonplace facts.

 The castle-building habit, the day-dreaming habit—how it grows! what
      a luxury it becomes; how we fly to its enchantments at every idle moment,
      how we revel in them, steep our souls in them, intoxicate ourselves with
      their beguiling fantasies—oh yes, and how soon and how easily our
      dream life and our material life become so intermingled and so fused
      together that we can't quite tell which is which, any more.

 By and by Aleck subscribed to a Chicago daily and for the Wall Street
      Pointer . With an eye single to finance she studied these as diligently
      all the week as she studied her Bible Sundays. Sally was lost in
      admiration, to note with what swift and sure strides her genius and
      judgment developed and expanded in the forecasting and handling of the
      securities of both the material and spiritual markets. He was proud of her
      nerve and daring in exploiting worldly stocks, and just as proud of her
      conservative caution in working her spiritual deals. He noted that she
      never lost her head in either case; that with a splendid courage she often
      went short on worldly futures, but heedfully drew the line there—she
      was always long on the others. Her policy was quite sane and simple, as
      she explained it to him: what she put into earthly futures was for
      speculation, what she put into spiritual futures was for investment; she
      was willing to go into the one on a margin, and take chances, but in the
      case of the other, “margin her no margins”—she wanted to cash in a
      hundred cents per dollar's worth, and have the stock transferred on the
      books.

 It took but a very few months to educate Aleck's imagination and Sally's.
      Each day's training added something to the spread and effectiveness of the
      two machines. As a consequence, Aleck made imaginary money much faster
      than at first she had dreamed of making it, and Sally's competency in
      spending the overflow of it kept pace with the strain put upon it, right
      along. In the beginning, Aleck had given the coal speculation a
      twelvemonth in which to materialize, and had been loath to grant that this
      term might possibly be shortened by nine months. But that was the feeble
      work, the nursery work, of a financial fancy that had had no teaching, no
      experience, no practice. These aids soon came, then that nine months
      vanished, and the imaginary ten-thousand-dollar investment came marching
      home with three hundred per cent. profit on its back!

 It was a great day for the pair of Fosters. They were speechless for joy.
      Also speechless for another reason: after much watching of the market,
      Aleck had lately, with fear and trembling, made her first flyer on a
      “margin,” using the remaining twenty thousand of the bequest in this risk.
      In her mind's eye she had seen it climb, point by point—always with
      a chance that the market would break—until at last her anxieties
      were too great for further endurance—she being new to the margin
      business and unhardened, as yet—and she gave her imaginary broker an
      imaginary order by imaginary telegraph to sell. She said forty thousand
      dollars' profit was enough. The sale was made on the very day that the
      coal venture had returned with its rich freight. As I have said, the
      couple were speechless, they sat dazed and blissful that night, trying to
      realize that they were actually worth a hundred thousand dollars in clean,
      imaginary cash. Yet so it was.

 It was the last time that ever Aleck was afraid of a margin; at least
      afraid enough to let it break her sleep and pale her cheek to the extent
      that this first experience in that line had done.

 Indeed it was a memorable night. Gradually the realization that they were
      rich sank securely home into the souls of the pair, then they began to
      place the money. If we could have looked out through the eyes of these
      dreamers, we should have seen their tidy little wooden house disappear,
      and two-story brick with a cast-iron fence in front of it take its place;
      we should have seen a three-globed gas-chandelier grow down from the
      parlor ceiling; we should have seen the homely rag carpet turn to noble
      Brussels, a dollar and a half a yard; we should have seen the plebeian
      fireplace vanish away and a recherche, big base-burner with isinglass
      windows take position and spread awe around. And we should have seen other
      things, too; among them the buggy, the lap-robe, the stove-pipe hat, and
      so on.

 From that time forth, although the daughters and the neighbors saw only
      the same old wooden house there, it was a two-story brick to Aleck and
      Sally and not a night went by that Aleck did not worry about the imaginary
      gas-bills, and get for all comfort Sally's reckless retort: “What of it?
      We can afford it.”

 Before the couple went to bed, that first night that they were rich, they
      had decided that they must celebrate. They must give a party—that
      was the idea. But how to explain it—to the daughters and the
      neighbors? They could not expose the fact that they were rich. Sally was
      willing, even anxious, to do it; but Aleck kept her head and would not
      allow it. She said that although the money was as good as in, it would be
      as well to wait until it was actually in. On that policy she took her
      stand, and would not budge. The great secret must be kept, she said—kept
      from the daughters and everybody else.

 The pair were puzzled. They must celebrate, they were determined to
      celebrate, but since the secret must be kept, what could they celebrate?
      No birthdays were due for three months. Tilbury wasn't available,
      evidently he was going to live forever; what the nation could they
      celebrate? That was Sally's way of putting it; and he was getting
      impatient, too, and harassed. But at last he hit it—just by sheer
      inspiration, as it seemed to him—and all their troubles were gone in
      a moment; they would celebrate the Discovery of America. A splendid idea!

 Aleck was almost too proud of Sally for words—she said she never
      would have thought of it. But Sally, although he was bursting with delight
      in the compliment and with wonder at himself, tried not to let on, and
      said it wasn't really anything, anybody could have done it. Whereat Aleck,
      with a prideful toss of her happy head, said:

 “Oh, certainly! Anybody could—oh, anybody! Hosannah Dilkins, for
      instance! Or maybe Adelbert Peanut—oh, dear —yes! Well,
      I'd like to see them try it, that's all. Dear-me-suz, if they could think
      of the discovery of a forty-acre island it's more than I believe
      they could; and as for the whole continent, why, Sally Foster, you know
      perfectly well it would strain the livers and lights out of them and then they couldn't!”

 The dear woman, she knew he had talent; and if affection made her
      over-estimate the size of it a little, surely it was a sweet and gentle
      crime, and forgivable for its source's sake.

  

  









 CHAPTER V

 The celebration went off well. The friends were all present, both the
      young and the old. Among the young were Flossie and Gracie Peanut and
      their brother Adelbert, who was a rising young journeyman tinner, also
      Hosannah Dilkins, Jr., journeyman plasterer, just out of his
      apprenticeship. For many months Adelbert and Hosannah had been showing
      interest in Gwendolen and Clytemnestra Foster, and the parents of the
      girls had noticed this with private satisfaction. But they suddenly
      realized now that that feeling had passed. They recognized that the
      changed financial conditions had raised up a social bar between their
      daughters and the young mechanics. The daughters could now look higher—and
      must. Yes, must. They need marry nothing below the grade of lawyer or
      merchant; poppa and momma would take care of this; there must be no
      mesalliances.

 However, these thinkings and projects of theirs were private, and did not
      show on the surface, and therefore threw no shadow upon the celebration.
      What showed upon the surface was a serene and lofty contentment and a
      dignity of carriage and gravity of deportment which compelled the
      admiration and likewise the wonder of the company. All noticed it and all
      commented upon it, but none was able to divine the secret of it. It was a
      marvel and a mystery. Three several persons remarked, without suspecting
      what clever shots they were making:

 “It's as if they'd come into property.”

 That was just it, indeed.

 Most mothers would have taken hold of the matrimonial matter in the old
      regulation way; they would have given the girls a talking to, of a solemn
      sort and untactful—a lecture calculated to defeat its own purpose,
      by producing tears and secret rebellion; and the said mothers would have
      further damaged the business by requesting the young mechanics to
      discontinue their attentions. But this mother was different. She was
      practical. She said nothing to any of the young people concerned, nor to
      any one else except Sally. He listened to her and understood; understood
      and admired. He said:

 “I get the idea. Instead of finding fault with the samples on view, thus
      hurting feelings and obstructing trade without occasion, you merely offer
      a higher class of goods for the money, and leave nature to take her
      course. It's wisdom, Aleck, solid wisdom, and sound as a nut. Who's your
      fish? Have you nominated him yet?”

 No, she hadn't. They must look the market over—which they did. To
      start with, they considered and discussed Brandish, rising young lawyer,
      and Fulton, rising young dentist. Sally must invite them to dinner. But
      not right away; there was no hurry, Aleck said. Keep an eye on the pair,
      and wait; nothing would be lost by going slowly in so important a matter.

 It turned out that this was wisdom, too; for inside of three weeks Aleck
      made a wonderful strike which swelled her imaginary hundred thousand to
      four hundred thousand of the same quality. She and Sally were in the
      clouds that evening. For the first time they introduced champagne at
      dinner. Not real champagne, but plenty real enough for the amount of
      imagination expended on it. It was Sally that did it, and Aleck weakly
      submitted. At bottom both were troubled and ashamed, for he was a high-up
      Son of Temperance, and at funerals wore an apron which no dog could look
      upon and retain his reason and his opinion; and she was a W. C. T. U.,
      with all that that implies of boiler-iron virtue and unendurable holiness.
      But there it was; the pride of riches was beginning its disintegrating
      work. They had lived to prove, once more, a sad truth which had been
      proven many times before in the world: that whereas principle is a great
      and noble protection against showy and degrading vanities and vices,
      poverty is worth six of it. More than four hundred thousand dollars to the
      good. They took up the matrimonial matter again. Neither the dentist nor
      the lawyer was mentioned; there was no occasion, they were out of the
      running. Disqualified. They discussed the son of the pork-packer and the
      son of the village banker. But finally, as in the previous case, they
      concluded to wait and think, and go cautiously and sure.

 Luck came their way again. Aleck, ever watchful saw a great and risky
      chance, and took a daring flyer. A time of trembling, of doubt, of awful
      uneasiness followed, for non-success meant absolute ruin and nothing short
      of it. Then came the result, and Aleck, faint with joy, could hardly
      control her voice when she said:

 “The suspense is over, Sally—and we are worth a cold million!”

 Sally wept for gratitude, and said:

 “Oh, Electra, jewel of women, darling of my heart, we are free at last, we
      roll in wealth, we need never scrimp again. It's a case for Veuve
      Cliquot!” and he got out a pint of spruce-beer and made sacrifice, he
      saying “Damn the expense,” and she rebuking him gently with reproachful
      but humid and happy eyes.

 They shelved the pork-packer's son and the banker's son, and sat down to
      consider the Governor's son and the son of the Congressman.

  

  









 CHAPTER VI

 It were a weariness to follow in detail the leaps and bounds the Foster
      fictitious finances took from this time forth. It was marvelous, it was
      dizzying, it was dazzling. Everything Aleck touched turned to fairy gold,
      and heaped itself glittering toward the firmament. Millions upon millions
      poured in, and still the mighty stream flowed thundering along, still its
      vast volume increased. Five millions—ten millions—twenty—thirty—was
      there never to be an end?

 Two years swept by in a splendid delirium, the intoxicated Fosters
      scarcely noticing the flight of time. They were now worth three hundred
      million dollars; they were in every board of directors of every prodigious
      combine in the country; and still as time drifted along, the millions went
      on piling up, five at a time, ten at a time, as fast as they could tally
      them off, almost. The three hundred double itself—then doubled again—and
      yet again—and yet once more.

 Twenty-four hundred millions!

 The business was getting a little confused. It was necessary to take an
      account of stock, and straighten it out. The Fosters knew it, they felt
      it, they realized that it was imperative; but they also knew that to do it
      properly and perfectly the task must be carried to a finish without a
      break when once it was begun. A ten-hours' job; and where could they find ten leisure hours in a bunch? Sally was selling pins and sugar
      and calico all day and every day; Aleck was cooking and washing dishes and
      sweeping and making beds all day and every day, with none to help, for the
      daughters were being saved up for high society. The Fosters knew there was
      one way to get the ten hours, and only one. Both were ashamed to name it;
      each waited for the other to do it. Finally Sally said:

 “Somebody's got to give in. It's up to me. Consider that I've named it—never
      mind pronouncing it out aloud.”

 Aleck colored, but was grateful. Without further remark, they fell. Fell,
      and—broke the Sabbath. For that was their only free ten-hour
      stretch. It was but another step in the downward path. Others would
      follow. Vast wealth has temptations which fatally and surely undermine the
      moral structure of persons not habituated to its possession.

 They pulled down the shades and broke the Sabbath. With hard and patient
      labor they overhauled their holdings and listed them. And a long-drawn
      procession of formidable names it was! Starting with the Railway Systems,
      Steamer Lines, Standard Oil, Ocean Cables, Diluted Telegraph, and all the
      rest, and winding up with Klondike, De Beers, Tammany Graft, and Shady
      Privileges in the Post-office Department.

 Twenty-four hundred millions, and all safely planted in Good Things,
      gilt-edged and interest-bearing. Income, $120,000,000 a year. Aleck
      fetched a long purr of soft delight, and said:

 “Is it enough?”

 “It is, Aleck.”

 “What shall we do?”

 “Stand pat.”

 “Retire from business?”

 “That's it.”

 “I am agreed. The good work is finished; we will take a long rest and
      enjoy the money.”

 “Good! Aleck!”

 “Yes, dear?”

 “How much of the income can we spend?”

 “The whole of it.”

 It seemed to her husband that a ton of chains fell from his limbs. He did
      not say a word; he was happy beyond the power of speech.

 After that, they broke the Sabbaths right along as fast as they turned up.
      It is the first wrong step that counts. Every Sunday they put in the whole
      day, after morning service, on inventions—inventions of ways to
      spend the money. They got to continuing this delicious dissipation until
      past midnight; and at every seance Aleck lavished millions upon great
      charities and religious enterprises, and Sally lavished like sums upon
      matters to which (at first) he gave definite names. Only at first. Later
      the names gradually lost sharpness of outline, and eventually faded into
      “sundries,” thus becoming entirely—but safely—undescriptive.
      For Sally was crumbling. The placing of these millions added seriously and
      most uncomfortably to the family expenses—in tallow candles. For a
      while Aleck was worried. Then, after a little, she ceased to worry, for
      the occasion of it was gone. She was pained, she was grieved, she was
      ashamed; but she said nothing, and so became an accessory. Sally was
      taking candles; he was robbing the store. It is ever thus. Vast wealth, to
      the person unaccustomed to it, is a bane; it eats into the flesh and bone
      of his morals. When the Fosters were poor, they could have been trusted
      with untold candles. But now they—but let us not dwell upon it. From
      candles to apples is but a step: Sally got to taking apples; then soap;
      then maple-sugar; then canned goods; then crockery. How easy it is to go
      from bad to worse, when once we have started upon a downward course!

 Meantime, other effects had been milestoning the course of the Fosters'
      splendid financial march. The fictitious brick dwelling had given place to
      an imaginary granite one with a checker-board mansard roof; in time this
      one disappeared and gave place to a still grander home—and so on and
      so on. Mansion after mansion, made of air, rose, higher, broader, finer,
      and each in its turn vanished away; until now in these latter great days,
      our dreamers were in fancy housed, in a distant region, in a sumptuous
      vast palace which looked out from a leafy summit upon a noble prospect of
      vale and river and receding hills steeped in tinted mists—and all
      private, all the property of the dreamers; a palace swarming with liveried
      servants, and populous with guests of fame and power, hailing from all the
      world's capitals, foreign and domestic.

 This palace was far, far away toward the rising sun, immeasurably remote,
      astronomically remote, in Newport, Rhode Island, Holy Land of High
      Society, ineffable Domain of the American Aristocracy. As a rule they
      spent a part of every Sabbath—after morning service—in this
      sumptuous home, the rest of it they spent in Europe, or in dawdling around
      in their private yacht. Six days of sordid and plodding fact life at home
      on the ragged edge of Lakeside and straitened means, the seventh in
      Fairyland—such had been their program and their habit.

 In their sternly restricted fact life they remained as of old—plodding,
      diligent, careful, practical, economical. They stuck loyally to the little
      Presbyterian Church, and labored faithfully in its interests and stood by
      its high and tough doctrines with all their mental and spiritual energies.
      But in their dream life they obeyed the invitations of their fancies,
      whatever they might be, and howsoever the fancies might change. Aleck's
      fancies were not very capricious, and not frequent, but Sally's scattered
      a good deal. Aleck, in her dream life, went over to the Episcopal camp, on
      account of its large official titles; next she became High-church on
      account of the candles and shows; and next she naturally changed to Rome,
      where there were cardinals and more candles. But these excursions were a
      nothing to Sally's. His dream life was a glowing and continuous and
      persistent excitement, and he kept every part of it fresh and sparkling by
      frequent changes, the religious part along with the rest. He worked his
      religions hard, and changed them with his shirt.

 The liberal spendings of the Fosters upon their fancies began early in
      their prosperities, and grew in prodigality step by step with their
      advancing fortunes. In time they became truly enormous. Aleck built a
      university or two per Sunday; also a hospital or two; also a Rowton hotel
      or so; also a batch of churches; now and then a cathedral; and once, with
      untimely and ill-chosen playfulness, Sally said, “It was a cold day when
      she didn't ship a cargo of missionaries to persuade unreflecting Chinamen
      to trade off twenty-four carat Confucianism for counterfeit Christianity.”

 This rude and unfeeling language hurt Aleck to the heart, and she went
      from the presence crying. That spectacle went to his own heart, and in his
      pain and shame he would have given worlds to have those unkind words back.
      She had uttered no syllable of reproach—and that cut him. Not one
      suggestion that he look at his own record—and she could have made,
      oh, so many, and such blistering ones! Her generous silence brought a
      swift revenge, for it turned his thoughts upon himself, it summoned before
      him a spectral procession, a moving vision of his life as he had been
      leading it these past few years of limitless prosperity, and as he sat
      there reviewing it his cheeks burned and his soul was steeped in
      humiliation. Look at her life—how fair it was, and tending ever
      upward; and look at his own—how frivolous, how charged with mean
      vanities, how selfish, how empty, how ignoble! And its trend—never
      upward, but downward, ever downward!

 He instituted comparisons between her record and his own. He had found
      fault with her—so he mused— he ! And what could he say
      for himself? When she built her first church what was he doing? Gathering
      other blase multimillionaires into a Poker Club; defiling his own palace
      with it; losing hundreds of thousands to it at every sitting, and sillily
      vain of the admiring notoriety it made for him. When she was building her
      first university, what was he doing? Polluting himself with a gay and
      dissipated secret life in the company of other fast bloods,
      multimillionaires in money and paupers in character. When she was building
      her first foundling asylum, what was he doing? Alas! When she was
      projecting her noble Society for the Purifying of the Sex, what was he
      doing? Ah, what, indeed! When she and the W. C. T. U. and the Woman with
      the Hatchet, moving with resistless march, were sweeping the fatal bottle
      from the land, what was he doing? Getting drunk three times a day. When
      she, builder of a hundred cathedrals, was being gratefully welcomed and
      blest in papal Rome and decorated with the Golden Rose which she had so
      honorably earned, what was he doing? Breaking the bank at Monte Carlo.

 He stopped. He could go no farther; he could not bear the rest. He rose
      up, with a great resolution upon his lips: this secret life should be
      revealed, and confessed; no longer would he live it clandestinely, he
      would go and tell her All.

 And that is what he did. He told her All; and wept upon her bosom; wept,
      and moaned, and begged for her forgiveness. It was a profound shock, and
      she staggered under the blow, but he was her own, the core of her heart,
      the blessing of her eyes, her all in all, she could deny him nothing, and
      she forgave him. She felt that he could never again be quite to her what
      he had been before; she knew that he could only repent, and not reform;
      yet all morally defaced and decayed as he was, was he not her own, her
      very own, the idol of her deathless worship? She said she was his serf,
      his slave, and she opened her yearning heart and took him in.

  

  









 CHAPTER VII

 One Sunday afternoon some time after this they were sailing the summer
      seas in their dream yacht, and reclining in lazy luxury under the awning
      of the after-deck. There was silence, for each was busy with his own
      thoughts. These seasons of silence had insensibly been growing more and
      more frequent of late; the old nearness and cordiality were waning.
      Sally's terrible revelation had done its work; Aleck had tried hard to
      drive the memory of it out of her mind, but it would not go, and the shame
      and bitterness of it were poisoning her gracious dream life. She could see
      now (on Sundays) that her husband was becoming a bloated and repulsive
      Thing. She could not close her eyes to this, and in these days she no
      longer looked at him, Sundays, when she could help it.

 But she—was she herself without blemish? Alas, she knew she was not.
      She was keeping a secret from him, she was acting dishonorably toward him,
      and many a pang it was costing her. She was breaking the compact, and
      concealing it from him . Under strong temptation she had gone into
      business again; she had risked their whole fortune in a purchase of all
      the railway systems and coal and steel companies in the country on a
      margin, and she was now trembling, every Sabbath hour, lest through some
      chance word of hers he find it out. In her misery and remorse for this
      treachery she could not keep her heart from going out to him in pity; she
      was filled with compunctions to see him lying there, drunk and contented,
      and never suspecting. Never suspecting—trusting her with a perfect
      and pathetic trust, and she holding over him by a thread a possible
      calamity of so devastating a—

 “ Say —Aleck?”

 The interrupting words brought her suddenly to herself. She was grateful
      to have that persecuting subject from her thoughts, and she answered, with
      much of the old-time tenderness in her tone:

 “Yes, dear.”

 “Do you know, Aleck, I think we are making a mistake—that is, you
      are. I mean about the marriage business.” He sat up, fat and froggy and
      benevolent, like a bronze Buddha, and grew earnest. “Consider—it's
      more than five years. You've continued the same policy from the start:
      with every rise, always holding on for five points higher. Always when I
      think we are going to have some weddings, you see a bigger thing ahead,
      and I undergo another disappointment. I think you are too hard to
      please. Some day we'll get left. First, we turned down the dentist and the
      lawyer. That was all right—it was sound. Next, we turned down the
      banker's son and the pork-butcher's heir—right again, and sound.
      Next, we turned down the Congressman's son and the Governor's—right
      as a trivet, I confess it. Next the Senator's son and the son of the
      Vice-President of the United States—perfectly right, there's no
      permanency about those little distinctions. Then you went for the
      aristocracy; and I thought we had struck oil at last—yes. We would
      make a plunge at the Four Hundred, and pull in some ancient lineage,
      venerable, holy, ineffable, mellow with the antiquity of a hundred and
      fifty years, disinfected of the ancestral odors of salt-cod and pelts all
      of a century ago, and unsmirched by a day's work since, and then! why,
      then the marriages, of course. But no, along comes a pair of real
      aristocrats from Europe, and straightway you throw over the half-breeds.
      It was awfully discouraging, Aleck! Since then, what a procession! You
      turned down the baronets for a pair of barons; you turned down the barons
      for a pair of viscounts; the viscounts for a pair of earls; the earls for
      a pair of marquises; the marquises for a brace of dukes. Now ,
      Aleck, cash in!—you've played the limit. You've got a job lot of
      four dukes under the hammer; of four nationalities; all sound in the wind
      and limb and pedigree, all bankrupt and in debt up to the ears. They come
      high, but we can afford it. Come, Aleck, don't delay any longer, don't
      keep up the suspense: take the whole lay-out, and leave the girls to
      choose!”

 Aleck had been smiling blandly and contentedly all through this
      arraignment of her marriage policy, a pleasant light, as of triumph with
      perhaps a nice surprise peeping out through it, rose in her eyes, and she
      said, as calmly as she could:

 “Sally, what would you say to— royalty ?”

 Prodigious! Poor man, it knocked him silly, and he fell over the
      garboard-strake and barked his shin on the cat-heads. He was dizzy for a
      moment, then he gathered himself up and limped over and sat down by his
      wife and beamed his old-time admiration and affection upon her in floods,
      out of his bleary eyes.

 “By George!” he said, fervently, “Aleck, you are great—the
      greatest woman in the whole earth! I can't ever learn the whole size of
      you. I can't ever learn the immeasurable deeps of you. Here I've been
      considering myself qualified to criticize your game. I! Why, if I
      had stopped to think, I'd have known you had a lone hand up your sleeve.
      Now, dear heart, I'm all red-hot impatience—tell me about it!”

 The flattered and happy woman put her lips to his ear and whispered a
      princely name. It made him catch his breath, it lit his face with
      exultation.

 “Land!” he said, “it's a stunning catch! He's got a gambling-hall, and a
      graveyard, and a bishop, and a cathedral—all his very own. And all
      gilt-edged five-hundred-per-cent. stock, every detail of it; the tidiest
      little property in Europe; and that graveyard—it's the selectest in
      the world: none but suicides admitted; yes , sir, and the free-list
      suspended, too, all the time. There isn't much land in the
      principality, but there's enough: eight hundred acres in the graveyard and
      forty-two outside. It's a sovereignty —that's the main thing; land's nothing. There's plenty land, Sahara's drugged with it.”

 Aleck glowed; she was profoundly happy. She said:

 “Think of it, Sally—it is a family that has never married outside
      the Royal and Imperial Houses of Europe: our grandchildren will sit upon
      thrones!”

 “True as you live, Aleck—and bear scepters, too; and handle them as
      naturally and nonchantly as I handle a yardstick. It's a grand catch,
      Aleck. He's corralled, is he? Can't get away? You didn't take him on a
      margin?”

 “No. Trust me for that. He's not a liability, he's an asset. So is the
      other one.”

 “Who is it, Aleck?”

 “His Royal Highness
      Sigismund-Siegfried-Lauenfeld-Dinkelspiel-Schwartzenberg Blutwurst,
      Hereditary Grand Duke of Katzenyammer.”

 “No! You can't mean it!”

 “It's as true as I'm sitting here, I give you my word,” she answered.

 His cup was full, and he hugged her to his heart with rapture, saying:

 “How wonderful it all seems, and how beautiful! It's one of the oldest and
      noblest of the three hundred and sixty-four ancient German principalities,
      and one of the few that was allowed to retain its royal estate when
      Bismarck got done trimming them. I know that farm, I've been there. It's
      got a rope-walk and a candle-factory and an army. Standing army. Infantry
      and cavalry. Three soldier and a horse. Aleck, it's been a long wait, and
      full of heartbreak and hope deferred, but God knows I am happy now. Happy,
      and grateful to you, my own, who have done it all. When is it to be?”

 “Next Sunday.”

 “Good. And we'll want to do these weddings up in the very regalest style
      that's going. It's properly due to the royal quality of the parties of the
      first part. Now as I understand it, there is only one kind of marriage
      that is sacred to royalty, exclusive to royalty: it's the morganatic.”

 “What do they call it that for, Sally?”

 “I don't know; but anyway it's royal, and royal only.”

 “Then we will insist upon it. More—I will compel it. It is
      morganatic marriage or none.”

 “That settles it!” said Sally, rubbing his hands with delight. “And it
      will be the very first in America. Aleck, it will make Newport sick.”

 Then they fell silent, and drifted away upon their dream wings to the far
      regions of the earth to invite all the crowned heads and their families
      and provide gratis transportation to them.

  

  









 CHAPTER VIII

 During three days the couple walked upon air, with their heads in the
      clouds. They were but vaguely conscious of their surroundings; they saw
      all things dimly, as through a veil; they were steeped in dreams, often
      they did not hear when they were spoken to; they often did not understand
      when they heard; they answered confusedly or at random; Sally sold
      molasses by weight, sugar by the yard, and furnished soap when asked for
      candles, and Aleck put the cat in the wash and fed milk to the soiled
      linen. Everybody was stunned and amazed, and went about muttering, “What can be the matter with the Fosters?”

 Three days. Then came events! Things had taken a happy turn, and for
      forty-eight hours Aleck's imaginary corner had been booming. Up—up—still
      up! Cost point was passed. Still up—and up—and up! Five points
      above cost—then ten—fifteen—twenty! Twenty points cold
      profit on the vast venture, now, and Aleck's imaginary brokers were
      shouting frantically by imaginary long-distance, “Sell! sell! for Heaven's
      sake sell !”

 She broke the splendid news to Sally, and he, too, said, “Sell! sell—oh,
      don't make a blunder, now, you own the earth!—sell, sell!” But she
      set her iron will and lashed it amidships, and said she would hold on for
      five points more if she died for it.

 It was a fatal resolve. The very next day came the historic crash, the
      record crash, the devastating crash, when the bottom fell out of Wall
      Street, and the whole body of gilt-edged stocks dropped ninety-five points
      in five hours, and the multimillionaire was seen begging his bread in the
      Bowery. Aleck sternly held her grip and “put up” as long as she could, but
      at last there came a call which she was powerless to meet, and her
      imaginary brokers sold her out. Then, and not till then, the man in her
      was vanished, and the woman in her resumed sway. She put her arms about
      her husband's neck and wept, saying:

 “I am to blame, do not forgive me, I cannot bear it. We are paupers!
      Paupers, and I am so miserable. The weddings will never come off; all that
      is past; we could not even buy the dentist, now.”

 A bitter reproach was on Sally's tongue: “I begged you to sell, but
      you—” He did not say it; he had not the heart to add a hurt to that
      broken and repentant spirit. A nobler thought came to him and he said:

 “Bear up, my Aleck, all is not lost! You really never invested a penny of
      my uncle's bequest, but only its unmaterialized future; what we have lost
      was only the incremented harvest from that future by your incomparable
      financial judgment and sagacity. Cheer up, banish these griefs; we still
      have the thirty thousand untouched; and with the experience which you have
      acquired, think what you will be able to do with it in a couple years! The
      marriages are not off, they are only postponed.”

 These were blessed words. Aleck saw how true they were, and their
      influence was electric; her tears ceased to flow, and her great spirit
      rose to its full stature again. With flashing eye and grateful heart, and
      with hand uplifted in pledge and prophecy, she said:

 “Now and here I proclaim—”

 But she was interrupted by a visitor. It was the editor and proprietor of
      the Sagamore . He had happened into Lakeside to pay a duty-call upon
      an obscure grandmother of his who was nearing the end of her pilgrimage,
      and with the idea of combining business with grief he had looked up the
      Fosters, who had been so absorbed in other things for the past four years
      that they neglected to pay up their subscription. Six dollars due. No
      visitor could have been more welcome. He would know all about Uncle
      Tilbury and what his chances might be getting to be, cemeterywards. They
      could, of course, ask no questions, for that would squelch the bequest,
      but they could nibble around on the edge of the subject and hope for
      results. The scheme did not work. The obtuse editor did not know he was
      being nibbled at; but at last, chance accomplished what art had failed in.
      In illustration of something under discussion which required the help of
      metaphor, the editor said:

 “Land, it's as tough as Tilbury Foster!—as we say.”

 It was sudden, and it made the Fosters jump. The editor noticed, and said,
      apologetically:

 “No harm intended, I assure you. It's just a saying; just a joke, you know—nothing
      in it. Relation of yours?”

 Sally crowded his burning eagerness down, and answered with all the
      indifference he could assume:

 “I—well, not that I know of, but we've heard of him.” The editor was
      thankful, and resumed his composure. Sally added: “Is he—is he—well?”

 “Is he well ? Why, bless you he's in Sheol these five years!”

 The Fosters were trembling with grief, though it felt like joy. Sally
      said, non-committally—and tentatively:

 “Ah, well, such is life, and none can escape—not even the rich are
      spared.”

 The editor laughed.

 “If you are including Tilbury,” said he, “it don't apply. He hadn't
      a cent; the town had to bury him.”

 The Fosters sat petrified for two minutes; petrified and cold. Then,
      white-faced and weak-voiced, Sally asked:

 “Is it true? Do you know it to be true?”

 “Well, I should say! I was one of the executors. He hadn't anything to
      leave but a wheelbarrow, and he left that to me. It hadn't any wheel, and
      wasn't any good. Still, it was something, and so, to square up, I
      scribbled off a sort of a little obituarial send-off for him, but it got
      crowded out.”

 The Fosters were not listening—their cup was full, it could contain
      no more. They sat with bowed heads, dead to all things but the ache at
      their hearts.

 An hour later. Still they sat there, bowed, motionless, silent, the
      visitor long ago gone, they unaware.

 Then they stirred, and lifted their heads wearily, and gazed at each other
      wistfully, dreamily, dazed; then presently began to twaddle to each other
      in a wandering and childish way. At intervals they lapsed into silences,
      leaving a sentence unfinished, seemingly either unaware of it or losing
      their way. Sometimes, when they woke out of these silences they had a dim
      and transient consciousness that something had happened to their minds;
      then with a dumb and yearning solicitude they would softly caress each
      other's hands in mutual compassion and support, as if they would say: “I
      am near you, I will not forsake you, we will bear it together; somewhere
      there is release and forgetfulness, somewhere there is a grave and peace;
      be patient, it will not be long.”

 They lived yet two years, in mental night, always brooding, steeped in
      vague regrets and melancholy dreams, never speaking; then release came to
      both on the same day.

 Toward the end the darkness lifted from Sally's ruined mind for a moment,
      and he said:

 “Vast wealth, acquired by sudden and unwholesome means, is a snare. It did
      us no good, transient were its feverish pleasures; yet for its sake we
      threw away our sweet and simple and happy life—let others take
      warning by us.”

 He lay silent awhile, with closed eyes; then as the chill of death crept
      upward toward his heart, and consciousness was fading from his brain, he
      muttered:

 “Money had brought him misery, and he took his revenge upon us, who had
      done him no harm. He had his desire: with base and cunning calculation he
      left us but thirty thousand, knowing we would try to increase it, and ruin
      our life and break our hearts. Without added expense he could have left us
      far above desire of increase, far above the temptation to speculate, and a
      kinder soul would have done it; but in him was no generous spirit, no
      pity, no—”
