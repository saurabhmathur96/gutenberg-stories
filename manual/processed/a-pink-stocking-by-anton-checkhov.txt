A PINK STOCKING
    

A DULL, rainy day.
      The sky is completely covered with heavy clouds, and there is no prospect
      of the rain ceasing. Outside sleet, puddles, and drenched jackdaws.
      Indoors it is half dark, and so cold that one wants the stove heated.
    

      Pavel Petrovitch Somov is pacing up and down his study, grumbling at the
      weather. The tears of rain on the windows and the darkness of the room
      make him depressed. He is insufferably bored and has nothing to do. . . .
      The newspapers have not been brought yet; shooting is out of the question,
      and it is not nearly dinner-time . . . .
    

      Somov is not alone in his study. Madame Somov, a pretty little lady in a
      light blouse and pink stockings, is sitting at his writing table. She is
      eagerly scribbling a letter. Every time he passes her as he strides up and
      down, Ivan Petrovitch looks over her shoulder at what she is writing. He
      sees big sprawling letters, thin and narrow, with all sorts of tails and
      flourishes. There are numbers of blots, smears, and finger-marks. Madame
      Somov does not like ruled paper, and every line runs downhill with horrid
      wriggles as it reaches the margin. . . .
    

      “Lidotchka, who is it you are writing such a lot to?” Somov
      inquires, seeing that his wife is just beginning to scribble the sixth
      page.
    

      “To sister Varya.”
    

      “Hm . . . it’s a long letter! I’m so bored—let me
      read it!”
    

      “Here, you may read it, but there’s nothing interesting in it.”
    

      Somov takes the written pages and, still pacing up and down, begins
      reading. Lidotchka leans her elbows on the back of her chair and watches
      the expression of his face. . . . After the first page his face lengthens
      and an expression of something almost like panic comes into it. . . . At
      the third page Somov frowns and scratches the back of his head. At the
      fourth he pauses, looks with a scared face at his wife, and seems to
      ponder. After thinking a little, he takes up the letter again with a sigh.
      . . . His face betrays perplexity and even alarm. . . .”
    

      “Well, this is beyond anything!” he mutters, as he finishes
      reading the letter and flings the sheets on the table, “It’s
      positively incredible!”
    

      “What’s the matter?” asks Lidotchka, flustered.
    

      “What’s the matter! You’ve covered six pages, wasted a
      good two hours scribbling, and there’s nothing in it at all! If
      there were one tiny idea! One reads on and on, and one’s brain is as
      muddled as though one were deciphering the Chinese wriggles on tea chests!
      Ough!”
    

      “Yes, that’s true, Vanya, . . .” says Lidotchka,
      reddening. “I wrote it carelessly. . . .”
    

      “Queer sort of carelessness! In a careless letter there is some
      meaning and style—there is sense in it—while yours . . .
      excuse me, but I don’t know what to call it! It’s absolute
      twaddle! There are words and sentences, but not the slightest sense in
      them. Your whole letter is exactly like the conversation of two boys:
      ‘We had pancakes to-day! And we had a soldier come to see us!’
      You say the same thing over and over again! You drag it out, repeat
      yourself . . . . The wretched ideas dance about like devils: there’s
      no making out where anything begins, where anything ends. . . . How can
      you write like that?”
    

      “If I had been writing carefully,” Lidotchka says in self
      defence, “then there would not have been mistakes. . . .”
    

      “Oh, I’m not talking about mistakes! The awful grammatical
      howlers! There’s not a line that’s not a personal insult to
      grammar! No stops nor commas—and the spelling . . . brrr! ‘Earth’
      has an a in it!! And the writing! It’s desperate! I’m
      not joking, Lida. . . . I’m surprised and appalled at your letter. .
      . . You mustn’t be angry, darling, but, really, I had no idea you
      were such a duffer at grammar. . . . And yet you belong to a cultivated,
      well-educated circle: you are the wife of a University man, and the
      daughter of a general! Tell me, did you ever go to school?”
    

      “What next! I finished at the Von Mebke’s boarding school. . .
      .”
    

      Somov shrugs his shoulders and continues to pace up and down, sighing.
      Lidotchka, conscious of her ignorance and ashamed of it, sighs too and
      casts down her eyes. . . . Ten minutes pass in silence.
    

      “You know, Lidotchka, it really is awful!” says Somov,
      suddenly halting in front of her and looking into her face with horror.
      “You are a mother . . . do you understand? A mother! How can you
      teach your children if you know nothing yourself? You have a good brain,
      but what’s the use of it if you have never mastered the very
      rudiments of knowledge? There—never mind about knowledge . . . the
      children will get that at school, but, you know, you are very shaky on the
      moral side too! You sometimes use such language that it makes my ears
      tingle!”
    

      Somov shrugs his shoulders again, wraps himself in the folds of his
      dressing-gown and continues his pacing. . . . He feels vexed and injured,
      and at the same time sorry for Lidotchka, who does not protest, but merely
      bKlinks. . . . Both feel oppressed and miserable . . . . Absorbed in their
      woes, they do not notice how time is passing and the dinner hour is
      approaching.
    

      Sitting down to dinner, Somov, who is fond of good eating and of eating in
      peace, drinks a large glass of vodka and begins talking about something
      else. Lidotchka listens and assents, but suddenly over the soup her eyes
      fill with tears and she begins whimpering.
    

      “It’s all mother’s fault!” she says, wiping away
      her tears with her dinner napkin. “Everyone advised her to send me
      to the high school, and from the high school I should have been sure to go
      on to the University!”
    

      “University . . . high school,” mutters Somov. “That’s
      running to extremes, my girl! What’s the good of being a blue
      stocking! A blue stocking is the very deuce! Neither man nor woman, but
      just something midway: neither one thing nor another. . . I hate blue
      stockings! I would never have married a learned woman. . . .”
    

      “There’s no making you out . . .”, says Lidotchka.
      “You are angry because I am not learned, and at the same time you
      hate learned women; you are annoyed because I have no ideas in my letter,
      and yet you yourself are opposed to my studying. . . .”
    

      “You do catch me up at a word, my dear,” yawns Somov, pouring
      out a second glass of vodka in his boredom.
    

      Under the influence of vodka and a good dinner, Somov grows more
      good-humoured, lively, and soft. . . . He watches his pretty wife making
      the salad with an anxious face and a rush of affection for her, of
      indulgence and forgiveness comes over him.
    

      “It was stupid of me to depress her, poor girl . . . ,” he
      thought. “Why did I say such a lot of dreadful things? She is silly,
      that’s true, uncivilised and narrow; but . . . there are two sides
      to the question, and audiatur et altera pars. . . . Perhaps people
      are perfectly right when they say that woman’s shallowness rests on
      her very vocation. Granted that it is her vocation to love her husband, to
      bear children, and to mix salad, what the devil does she want with
      learning? No, indeed!”
    

      At that point he remembers that learned women are usually tedious, that
      they are exacting, strict, and unyielding; and, on the other hand, how
      easy it is to get on with silly Lidotchka, who never pokes her nose into
      anything, does not understand so much, and never obtrudes her criticism.
      There is peace and comfort with Lidotchka, and no risk of being interfered
      with.
    

      “Confound them, those clever and learned women! It’s better
      and easier to live with simple ones,” he thinks, as he takes a plate
      of chicken from Lidotchka.
    

      He recollects that a civilised man sometimes feels a desire to talk and
      share his thoughts with a clever and well-educated woman. “What of
      it?” thinks Somov. “If I want to talk of intellectual
      subjects, I’ll go to Natalya Andreyevna . . . or to Marya
      Frantsovna. . . . It’s very simple! But no, I shan’t go. One
      can discuss intellectual subjects with men,” he finally decides.
    











      AT A SUMMER VILLA
    

“I LOVE YOU.
      You are my life, my happiness—everything to me! Forgive the avowal,
      but I have not the strength to suffer and be silent. I ask not for love in
      return, but for sympathy. Be at the old arbour at eight o’clock this
      evening. . . . To sign my name is unnecessary I think, but do not be
      uneasy at my being anonymous. I am young, nice-looking . . . what more do
      you want?”
    

      When Pavel Ivanitch Vyhodtsev, a practical married man who was spending
      his holidays at a summer villa, read this letter, he shrugged his
      shoulders and scratched his forehead in perplexity.
    

      “What devilry is this?” he thought. “I’m a married
      man, and to send me such a queer . . . silly letter! Who wrote it?”
    

      Pavel Ivanitch turned the letter over and over before his eyes, read it
      through again, and spat with disgust.
    

      “‘I love you’” . . . he said jeeringly. “A
      nice boy she has pitched on! So I’m to run off to meet you in the
      arbour! . . . I got over all such romances and fleurs d’amour
      years ago, my girl. . . . Hm! She must be some reckless, immoral creature.
      . . . Well, these women are a set! What a whirligig—God forgive us!—she
      must be to write a letter like that to a stranger, and a married man, too!
      It’s real demoralisation!”
    

      In the course of his eight years of married life Pavel Ivanitch had
      completely got over all sentimental feeling, and he had received no
      letters from ladies except letters of congratulation, and so, although he
      tried to carry it off with disdain, the letter quoted above greatly
      intrigued and agitated him.
    

      An hour after receiving it, he was lying on his sofa, thinking:
    

      “Of course I am not a silly boy, and I am not going to rush off to
      this idiotic rendezvous; but yet it would be interesting to know who wrote
      it! Hm. . . . It is certainly a woman’s writing. . . . The letter is
      written with genuine feeling, and so it can hardly be a joke. . . . Most
      likely it’s some neurotic girl, or perhaps a widow . . . widows are
      frivolous and eccentric as a rule. Hm. . . . Who could it be?”
    

      What made it the more difficult to decide the question was that Pavel
      Ivanitch had not one feminine acquaintance among all the summer visitors,
      except his wife.
    

      “It is queer . . .” he mused. “‘I love you!’.
      . . When did she manage to fall in love? Amazing woman! To fall in love
      like this, apropos of nothing, without making any acquaintance and finding
      out what sort of man I am. . . . She must be extremely young and romantic
      if she is capable of falling in love after two or three looks at me. . . .
      But . . . who is she?”
    

      Pavel Ivanitch suddenly recalled that when he had been walking among the
      summer villas the day before, and the day before that, he had several
      times been met by a fair young lady with a light blue hat and a turn-up
      nose. The fair charmer had kept looking at him, and when he sat down on a
      seat she had sat down beside him. . . .
    

      “Can it be she?” Vyhodtsev wondered. “It can’t be!
      Could a delicate ephemeral creature like that fall in love with a worn-out
      old eel like me? No, it’s impossible!”
    

      At dinner Pavel Ivanitch looked blankly at his wife while he meditated:
    

      “She writes that she is young and nice-looking. . . . So she’s
      not old. . . . Hm. . . . To tell the truth, honestly I am not so old and
      plain that no one could fall in love with me. My wife loves me! Besides,
      love is blind, we all know. . . .”
    

      “What are you thinking about?” his wife asked him.
    

      “Oh. . . my head aches a little. . .” Pavel Ivanitch said,
      quite untruly.
    

      He made up his mind that it was stupid to pay attention to such a
      nonsensical thing as a love-letter, and laughed at it and at its
      authoress, but—alas!—powerful is the “dacha” enemy
      of mankind! After dinner, Pavel Ivanitch lay down on his bed, and instead
      of going to sleep, reflected:
    

      “But there, I daresay she is expecting me to come! What a silly! I
      can just imagine what a nervous fidget she’ll be in and how her tournure
      will quiver when she does not find me in the arbour! I shan’t go,
      though. . . . Bother her!”
    

      But, I repeat, powerful is the enemy of mankind.
    

      “Though I might, perhaps, just out of curiosity . . .” he was
      musing, half an hour later. “I might go and look from a distance
      what sort of a creature she is. . . . It would be interesting to have a
      look at her! It would be fun, and that’s all! After all, why shouldn’t
      I have a little fun since such a chance has turned up?”
    

      Pavel Ivanitch got up from his bed and began dressing. “What are you
      getting yourself up so smartly for?” his wife asked, noticing that
      he was putting on a clean shirt and a fashionable tie.
    

      “Oh, nothing. . . . I must have a walk. . . . My head aches. . . .
      Hm.”
    

      Pavel Ivanitch dressed in his best, and waiting till eight o’clock,
      went out of the house. When the figures of gaily dressed summer visitors
      of both sexes began passing before his eyes against the bright green
      background, his heart throbbed.
    

      “Which of them is it? . . .” he wondered, advancing
      irresolutely. “Come, what am I afraid of? Why, I am not going to the
      rendezvous! What . . . a fool! Go forward boldly! And what if I go into
      the arbour? Well, well . . . there is no reason I should.”
    

      Pavel Ivanitch’s heart beat still more violently. . . .
      Involuntarily, with no desire to do so, he suddenly pictured to himself
      the half-darkness of the arbour. . . . A graceful fair girl with a little
      blue hat and a turn-up nose rose before his imagination. He saw her,
      abashed by her love and trembling all over, timidly approach him,
      breathing excitedly, and . . . suddenly clasping him in her arms.
    

      “If I weren’t married it would be all right . . .” he
      mused, driving sinful ideas out of his head. “Though . . . for once
      in my life, it would do no harm to have the experience, or else one will
      die without knowing what. . . . And my wife, what will it matter to her?
      Thank God, for eight years I’ve never moved one step away from her.
      . . . Eight years of irreproachable duty! Enough of her. . . . It’s
      positively vexatious. . . . I’m ready to go to spite her!”
    

      Trembling all over and holding his breath, Pavel Ivanitch went up to the
      arbour, wreathed with ivy and wild vine, and peeped into it . . . . A
      smell of dampness and mildew reached him. . . .
    

      “I believe there’s nobody . . .” he thought, going into
      the arbour, and at once saw a human silhouette in the corner.
    

      The silhouette was that of a man. . . . Looking more closely, Pavel
      Ivanitch recognised his wife’s brother, Mitya, a student, who was
      staying with them at the villa.
    

      “Oh, it’s you . . .” he growled discontentedly, as he
      took off his hat and sat down.
    

      “Yes, it’s I” . . . answered Mitya.
    

      Two minutes passed in silence.
    

      “Excuse me, Pavel Ivanitch,” began Mitya: “but might I
      ask you to leave me alone?? . . . I am thinking over the dissertation for
      my degree and . . . and the presence of anybody else prevents my thinking.”
    

      “You had better go somewhere in a dark avenue. . .” Pavel
      Ivanitch observed mildly. “It’s easier to think in the open
      air, and, besides, . . . er . . . I should like to have a little sleep
      here on this seat. . . It’s not so hot here. . . .”
    

      “You want to sleep, but it’s a question of my dissertation . .
      .” Mitya grumbled. “The dissertation is more important.”
    

      Again there was a silence. Pavel Ivanitch, who had given the rein to his
      imagination and was continually hearing footsteps, suddenly leaped up and
      said in a plaintive voice:
    

      “Come, I beg you, Mitya! You are younger and ought to consider me .
      . . . I am unwell and . . . I need sleep. . . . Go away!”
    

      “That’s egoism. . . . Why must you be here and not I? I won’t
      go as a matter of principle.”
    

      “Come, I ask you to! Suppose I am an egoist, a despot and a fool . .
      . but I ask you to go! For once in my life I ask you a favour! Show some
      consideration!”
    

      Mitya shook his head.
    

      “What a beast! . . .” thought Pavel Ivanitch. “That can’t
      be a rendezvous with him here! It’s impossible with him here!”
    

      “I say, Mitya,” he said, “I ask you for the last time. .
      . . Show that you are a sensible, humane, and cultivated man!”
    

      “I don’t know why you keep on so!” . . . said Mitya,
      shrugging his shoulders. “I’ve said I won’t go, and I
      won’t. I shall stay here as a matter of principle. . . .”
    

      At that moment a woman’s face with a turn-up nose peeped into the
      arbour. . . .
    

      Seeing Mitya and Pavel Ivanitch, it frowned and vanished.
    

      “She is gone!” thought Pavel Ivanitch, looking angrily at
      Mitya. “She saw that blackguard and fled! It’s all spoilt!”
    

      After waiting a little longer, he got up, put on his hat and said:
    

      “You’re a beast, a low brute and a blackguard! Yes! A beast!
      It’s mean . . . and silly! Everything is at an end between us!”
    

      “Delighted to hear it!” muttered Mitya, also getting up and
      putting on his hat. “Let me tell you that by being here just now you’ve
      played me such a dirty trick that I’ll never forgive you as long as
      I live.”
    

      Pavel Ivanitch went out of the arbour, and beside himself with rage,
      strode rapidly to his villa. Even the sight of the table laid for supper
      did not soothe him.
    

      “Once in a lifetime such a chance has turned up,” he thought
      in agitation; “and then it’s been prevented! Now she is
      offended . . . crushed!”
    

      At supper Pavel Ivanitch and Mitya kept their eyes on their plates and
      maintained a sullen silence. . . . They were hating each other from the
      bottom of their hearts.
    

      “What are you smiling at?” asked Pavel Ivanitch, pouncing on
      his wife. “It’s only silly fools who laugh for nothing!”
    

      His wife looked at her husband’s angry face, and went off into a
      peal of laughter.
    

      “What was that letter you got this morning?” she asked.
    

      “I? . . . I didn’t get one. . . .” Pavel Ivanitch was
      overcome with confusion. “You are inventing . . . imagination.”
    

      “Oh, come, tell us! Own up, you did! Why, it was I sent you that
      letter! Honour bright, I did! Ha ha!”
    

      Pavel Ivanitch turned crimson and bent over his plate. “Silly jokes,”
      he growled.
    

      “But what could I do? Tell me that. . . . We had to scrub the rooms
      out this evening, and how could we get you out of the house? There was no
      other way of getting you out. . . . But don’t be angry, stupid. . .
      . I didn’t want you to be dull in the arbour, so I sent the same
      letter to Mitya too! Mitya, have you been to the arbour?”
    

      Mitya grinned and left off glaring with hatred at his rival.
    
The House With The Mezzanine,
