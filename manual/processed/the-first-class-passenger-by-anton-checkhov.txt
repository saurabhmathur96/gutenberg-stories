THE FIRST-CLASS PASSENGER
    

A FIRST-CLASS
      passenger who had just dined at the station and drunk a little too much
      lay down on the velvet-covered seat, stretched himself out luxuriously,
      and sank into a doze. After a nap of no more than five minutes, he looked
      with oily eyes at his vis-a-vis, gave a smirk, and said:
    

      “My father of blessed memory used to like to have his heels tickled
      by peasant women after dinner. I am just like him, with this difference,
      that after dinner I always like my tongue and my brains gently stimulated.
      Sinful man as I am, I like empty talk on a full stomach. Will you allow me
      to have a chat with you?”
    

      “I shall be delighted,” answered the vis-a-vis.


      “After a good dinner the most trifling subject is sufficient to
      arouse devilishly great thoughts in my brain. For instance, we saw just
      now near the refreshment bar two young men, and you heard one congratulate
      the other on being celebrated. ‘I congratulate you,’ he said;
      ‘you are already a celebrity and are beginning to win fame.’
      Evidently actors or journalists of microscopic dimensions. But they are
      not the point. The question that is occupying my mind at the moment, sir,
      is exactly what is to be understood by the word fame or charity.
      What do you think? Pushkin called fame a bright patch on a ragged garment;
      we all understand it as Pushkin does—that is, more or less
      subjectively—but no one has yet given a clear, logical definition of
      the word.... I would give a good deal for such a definition!”
    

      “Why do you feel such a need for it?”
    

      “You see, if we knew what fame is, the means of attaining it might
      also perhaps be known to us,” said the first-class passenger, after
      a moment’s thought. “I must tell you, sir, that when I was
      younger I strove after celebrity with every fiber of my being. To be
      popular was my craze, so to speak. For the sake of it I studied, worked,
      sat up at night, neglected my meals. And I fancy, as far as I can judge
      without partiality, I had all the natural gifts for attaining it. To begin
      with, I am an engineer by profession. In the course of my life I have
      built in Russia some two dozen magnificent bridges, I have laid aqueducts
      for three towns; I have worked in Russia, in England, in Belgium....
      Secondly, I am the author of several special treatises in my own line. And
      thirdly, my dear sir, I have from a boy had a weakness for chemistry.
      Studying that science in my leisure hours, I discovered methods of
      obtaining certain organic acids, so that you will find my name in all the
      foreign manuals of chemistry. I have always been in the service, I have
      risen to the grade of actual civil councilor, and I have an unblemished
      record. I will not fatigue your attention by enumerating my works and my
      merits, I will only say that I have done far more than some celebrities.
      And yet here I am in my old age, I am getting ready for my coffin, so to
      say, and I am as celebrated as that black dog yonder running on the
      embankment.”
    

      “How can you tell? Perhaps you are celebrated.”
    

      “H’m! Well, we will test it at once. Tell me, have you ever
      heard the name Krikunov?”
    

      The vis-a-vis raised his eyes to the ceiling, thought a minute, and
      laughed.
    

      “No, I haven’t heard it,...” he said.
    

      “That is my surname. You, a man of education, getting on in years,
      have never heard of me—a convincing proof! It is evident that in my
      efforts to gain fame I have not done the right thing at all: I did not
      know the right way to set to work, and, trying to catch fame by the tail,
      got on the wrong side of her.”
    

      “What is the right way to set to work?”
    

      “Well, the devil only knows! Talent, you say? Genius? Originality?
      Not a bit of it, sir!... People have lived and made a career side by side
      with me who were worthless, trivial, and even contemptible compared with
      me. They did not do one-tenth of the work I did, did not put themselves
      out, were not distinguished for their talents, and did not make an effort
      to be celebrated, but just look at them! Their names are continually in
      the newspapers and on men’s lips! If you are not tired of listening
      I will illustrate it by an example. Some years ago I built a bridge in the
      town of K. I must tell you that the dullness of that scurvy little town
      was terrible. If it had not been for women and cards I believe I should
      have gone out of my mind. Well, it’s an old story: I was so bored
      that I got into an affair with a singer. Everyone was enthusiastic about
      her, the devil only knows why; to my thinking she was—what shall I
      say?—an ordinary, commonplace creature, like lots of others. The
      hussy was empty-headed, ill-tempered, greedy, and what’s more, she
      was a fool.
    

      “She ate and drank a vast amount, slept till five o clock in the
      afternoon—and I fancy did nothing else. She was looked upon as a
      cocotte, and that was indeed her profession; but when people wanted to
      refer to her in a literary fashion, they called her an actress and a
      singer. I used to be devoted to the theatre, and therefore this fraudulent
      pretense of being an actress made me furiously indignant. My young lady
      had not the slightest right to call herself an actress or a singer. She
      was a creature entirely devoid of talent, devoid of feeling—a
      pitiful creature one may say. As far as I can judge she sang disgustingly.
      The whole charm of her ‘art’ lay in her kicking up her legs on
      every suitable occasion, and not being embarrassed when people walked into
      her dressing-room. She usually selected translated vaudevilles, with
      singing in them, and opportunities for disporting herself in male attire,
      in tights. In fact it was—ough! Well, I ask your attention. As I
      remember now, a public ceremony took place to celebrate the opening of the
      newly constructed bridge. There was a religious service, there were
      speeches, telegrams, and so on. I hung about my cherished creation, you
      know, all the while afraid that my heart would burst with the excitement
      of an author. It’s an old story and there’s no need for false
      modesty, and so I will tell you that my bridge was a magnificent work! It
      was not a bridge but a picture, a perfect delight! And who would not have
      been excited when the whole town came to the opening? ‘Oh,’ I
      thought, ‘now the eyes of all the public will be on me! Where shall
      I hide myself?’ Well, I need not have worried myself, sir—alas!
      Except the official personages, no one took the slightest notice of me.
      They stood in a crowd on the river-bank, gazed like sheep at the bridge,
      and did not concern themselves to know who had built it. And it was from
      that time, by the way, that I began to hate our estimable public—damnation
      take them! Well, to continue. All at once the public became agitated; a
      whisper ran through the crowd,... a smile came on their faces, their
      shoulders began to move. ‘They must have seen me,’ I thought.
      A likely idea! I looked, and my singer, with a train of young scamps, was
      making her way through the crowd. The eyes of the crowd were hurriedly
      following this procession. A whisper began in a thousand voices: ‘That’s
      so-and-so.... Charming! Bewitching!’ Then it was they noticed me....
      A couple of young milksops, local amateurs of the scenic art, I presume,
      looked at me, exchanged glances, and whispered: ‘That’s her
      lover!’ How do you like that? And an unprepossessing individual in a
      top-hat, with a chin that badly needed shaving, hung round me, shifting
      from one foot to the other, then turned to me with the words:
    

      “‘Do you know who that lady is, walking on the other bank?
      That’s so-and-so.... Her voice is beneath all criticism, but she has
      a most perfect mastery of it!...’
    

      “‘Can you tell me,’ I asked the unprepossessing
      individual, ‘who built this bridge?’
    

      “‘I really don’t know,’ answered the individual;
      some engineer, I expect.’
    

      “‘And who built the cathedral in your town?’ I asked
      again.
    

      “‘I really can’t tell you.’
    

      “Then I asked him who was considered the best teacher in K., who the
      best architect, and to all my questions the unprepossessing individual
      answered that he did not know.
    

      “‘And tell me, please,’ I asked in conclusion, with whom
      is that singer living?’
    

      “‘With some engineer called Krikunov.’
    

      “Well, how do you like that, sir? But to proceed. There are no
      minnesingers or bards nowadays, and celebrity is created almost
      exclusively by the newspapers. The day after the dedication of the bridge,
      I greedily snatched up the local Messenger, and looked for myself
      in it. I spent a long time running my eyes over all the four pages, and at
      last there it was—hurrah! I began reading: ‘Yesterday in
      beautiful weather, before a vast concourse of people, in the presence of
      His Excellency the Governor of the province, so-and-so, and other
      dignitaries, the ceremony of the dedication of the newly constructed
      bridge took place,’ and so on.... Towards the end: Our talented
      actress so-and-so, the favorite of the K. public, was present at the
      dedication looking very beautiful. I need not say that her arrival created
      a sensation. The star was wearing...’ and so on. They might have
      given me one word! Half a word. Petty as it seems, I actually cried with
      vexation!
    

      “I consoled myself with the reflection that the provinces are
      stupid, and one could expect nothing of them and for celebrity one must go
      to the intellectual centers—to Petersburg and to Moscow. And as it
      happened, at that very time there was a work of mine in Petersburg which I
      had sent in for a competition. The date on which the result was to be
      declared was at hand.
    

      “I took leave of K. and went to Petersburg. It is a long journey
      from K. to Petersburg, and that I might not be bored on the journey I took
      a reserved compartment and—well—of course, I took my singer.
      We set off, and all the way we were eating, drinking champagne, and—tra-la-la!
      But behold, at last we reach the intellectual center. I arrived on the
      very day the result was declared, and had the satisfaction, my dear sir,
      of celebrating my own success: my work received the first prize. Hurrah!
      Next day I went out along the Nevsky and spent seventy kopecks on various
      newspapers. I hastened to my hotel room, lay down on the sofa, and,
      controlling a quiver of excitement, made haste to read. I ran through one
      newspaper—nothing. I ran through a second—nothing either; my
      God! At last, in the fourth, I lighted upon the following paragraph:
      ‘Yesterday the well-known provincial actress so-and-so arrived by
      express in Petersburg. We note with pleasure that the climate of the South
      has had a beneficial effect on our fair friend; her charming stage
      appearance...’ and I don't remember the rest! Much lower down than
      that paragraph I found, printed in the smallest type: ’First prize
      in the competition was adjudged to an engineer called so-and-so.’
      That was all! And to make things better, they even misspelt my name:
      instead of Krikunov it was Kirkutlov. So much for your intellectual
      center! But that was not all.... By the time I left Petersburg, a month
      later, all the newspapers were vying with one another in discussing our
      incomparable, divine, highly talented actress, and my mistress was
      referred to, not by her surname, but by her Christian name and her father’s....
    

      “Some years later I was in Moscow. I was summoned there by a letter,
      in the mayor’s own handwriting, to undertake a work for which
      Moscow, in its newspapers, had been clamoring for over a hundred years. In
      the intervals of my work I delivered five public lectures, with a
      philanthropic object, in one of the museums there. One would have thought
      that was enough to make one known to the whole town for three days at
      least, wouldn’t one? But, alas! not a single Moscow gazette said a
      word about me. There was something about houses on fire, about an
      operetta, sleeping town councilors, drunken shop keepers—about
      everything; but about my work, my plans, my lectures—mum. And a nice
      set they are in Moscow! I got into a tram.... It was packed full; there
      were ladies and military men and students of both sexes, creatures of all
      sorts in couples.
    

      “‘I am told the town council has sent for an engineer to plan
      such and such a work!’ I said to my neighbor, so loudly that all the
      tram could hear. ‘Do you know the name of the engineer?’
    

      “My neighbor shook his head. The rest of the public took a cursory
      glance at me, and in all their eyes I read: ‘I don’t know.’
    

      “‘I am told that there is someone giving lectures in such and
      such a museum?’ I persisted, trying to get up a conversation.
      ‘I hear it is interesting.’
    

      “No one even nodded. Evidently they had not all of them heard of the
      lectures, and the ladies were not even aware of the existence of the
      museum. All that would not have mattered, but imagine, my dear sir, the
      people suddenly leaped to their feet and struggled to the windows. What
      was it? What was the matter?
    

      “‘Look, look!’ my neighbor nudged me. ‘Do you see
      that dark man getting into that cab? That’s the famous runner, King!’
    

      “And the whole tram began talking breathlessly of the runner who was
      then absorbing the brains of Moscow.
    

      “I could give you ever so many other examples, but I think that is
      enough. Now let us assume that I am mistaken about myself, that I am a
      wretchedly boastful and incompetent person; but apart from myself I might
      point to many of my contemporaries, men remarkable for their talent and
      industry, who have nevertheless died unrecognized. Are Russian navigators,
      chemists, physicists, mechanicians, and agriculturists popular with the
      public? Do our cultivated masses know anything of Russian artists,
      sculptors, and literary men? Some old literary hack, hard-working and
      talented, will wear away the doorstep of the publishers’ offices for
      thirty-three years, cover reams of paper, be had up for libel twenty
      times, and yet not step beyond his ant-heap. Can you mention to me a
      single representative of our literature who would have become celebrated
      if the rumor had not been spread over the earth that he had been killed in
      a duel, gone out of his mind, been sent into exile, or had cheated at
      cards?”
    

      The first-class passenger was so excited that he dropped his cigar out of
      his mouth and got up.
    

      “Yes,” he went on fiercely, “and side by side with these
      people I can quote you hundreds of all sorts of singers, acrobats,
      buffoons, whose names are known to every baby. Yes!”
    

      The door creaked, there was a draught, and an individual of forbidding
      aspect, wearing an Inverness coat, a top-hat, and blue spectacles, walked
      into the carriage. The individual looked round at the seats, frowned, and
      went on further.
    

      “Do you know who that is?” there came a timid whisper from the
      furthest corner of the compartment.
    

      “That is N. N., the famous Tula cardsharper who was had up in
      connection with the Y. bank affair.”
    

      “There you are!” laughed the first-class passenger. “He
      knows a Tula cardsharper, but ask him whether he knows Semiradsky,
      Tchaykovsky, or Solovyov the philosopher—he’ll shake his
      head.... It swinish!”
    

      Three minutes passed in silence.
    

      “Allow me in my turn to ask you a question,” said the vis-a-vis
      timidly, clearing his throat. “Do you know the name of Pushkov?”
    

      “Pushkov? H’m! Pushkov.... No, I don’t know it!”
    

      “That is my name,...” said the vis-a-vis,, overcome
      with embarrassment. “Then you don’t know it? And yet I have
      been a professor at one of the Russian universities for thirty-five
      years,... a member of the Academy of Sciences,... have published more than
      one work....”
    

      The first-class passenger and the vis-a-vis looked at each other
      and burst out laughing.
