THE KISS

 My Little Darling: So you are crying from morning until night and from
      night until morning, because your husband leaves you; you do not know what
      to do and so you ask your old aunt for advice; you must consider her quite
      an expert. I don't know as much as you think I do, and yet I am not
      entirely ignorant of the art of loving, or, rather, of making one's self
      loved, in which you are a little lacking. I can admit that at my age.

 You say that you are all attention, love, kisses and caresses for him.
      Perhaps that is the very trouble; I think you kiss him too much.

 My dear, we have in our hands the most terrible power in the world: LOVE.

 Man is gifted with physical strength, and he exercises force. Woman is
      gifted with charm, and she rules with caresses. It is our weapon,
      formidable and invincible, but we should know how to use it.

 Know well that we are the mistresses of the world! To tell the history of
      Love from the beginning of the world would be to tell the history of man
      himself: Everything springs from it, the arts, great events, customs,
      wars, the overthrow of empires.

 In the Bible you find Delila, Judith; in fables we find Omphale, Helen; in
      history the Sabines, Cleopatra and many others.

 Therefore we reign supreme, all-powerful. But, like kings, we must make
      use of delicate diplomacy.

 Love, my dear, is made up of imperceptible sensations. We know that it is
      as strong as death, but also as frail as glass. The slightest shock breaks
      it, and our power crumbles, and we are never able to raise it again.

 We have the power of making ourselves adored, but we lack one tiny thing,
      the understanding of the various kinds of caresses. In embraces we lose
      the sentiment of delicacy, while the man over whom we rule remains master
      of himself, capable of judging the foolishness of certain words. Take
      care, my dear; that is the defect in our armor. It is our Achilles' heel.

 Do you know whence comes our real power? From the kiss, the kiss alone!
      When we know how to hold out and give up our lips we can become queens.

 The kiss is only a preface, however, but a charming preface. More charming
      than the realization itself. A preface which can always be read over
      again, whereas one cannot always read over the book.

 Yes, the meeting of lips is the most perfect, the most divine sensation
      given to human beings, the supreme limit of happiness: It is in the kiss
      alone that one sometimes seems to feel this union of souls after which we
      strive, the intermingling of hearts, as it were.

 Do you remember the verses of Sully-Prudhomme:

 Caresses are nothing but anxious bliss,
   Vain attempts of love to unite souls through a kiss.

 One caress alone gives this deep sensation of two beings welded into one
      —it is the kiss. No violent delirium of complete possession is worth
      this trembling approach of the lips, this first moist and fresh contact,
      and then the long, lingering, motionless rapture.

 Therefore, my dear, the kiss is our strongest weapon, but we must take
      care not to dull it. Do not forget that its value is only relative, purely
      conventional. It continually changes according to circumstances, the state
      of expectancy and the ecstasy of the mind. I will call attention to one
      example.

 Another poet, Francois Coppee, has written a line which we all remember, a
      line which we find delightful, which moves our very hearts.

 After describing the expectancy of a lover, waiting in a room one winter's
      evening, his anxiety, his nervous impatience, the terrible fear of not
      seeing her, he describes the arrival of the beloved woman, who at last
      enters hurriedly, out of breath, bringing with her part of the winter
      breeze, and he exclaims:

 Oh! the taste of the kisses first snatched through the veil.

 Is that not a line of exquisite sentiment, a delicate and charming
      observation, a perfect truth? All those who have hastened to a clandestine
      meeting, whom passion has thrown into the arms of a man, well do they know
      these first delicious kisses through the veil; and they tremble at the
      memory of them. And yet their sole charm lies in the circumstances, from
      being late, from the anxious expectancy, but from the purely—or,
      rather, impurely, if you prefer—sensual point of view, they are
      detestable.

 Think! Outside it is cold. The young woman has walked quickly; the veil is
      moist from her cold breath. Little drops of water shine in the lace. The
      lover seizes her and presses his burning lips to her liquid breath. The
      moist veil, which discolors and carries the dreadful odor of chemical dye,
      penetrates into the young man's mouth, moistens his mustache. He does not
      taste the lips of his beloved, he tastes the dye of this lace moistened
      with cold breath. And yet, like the poet, we would all exclaim:

 Oh! the taste of the kisses first snatched through the veil.

 Therefore, the value of this caress being entirely a matter of convention,
      we must be careful not to abuse it.

 Well, my dear, I have several times noticed that you are very clumsy.
      However, you were not alone in that fault; the majority of women lose
      their authority by abusing the kiss with untimely kisses. When they feel
      that their husband or their lover is a little tired, at those times when
      the heart as well as the body needs rest, instead of understanding what is
      going on within him, they persist in giving inopportune caresses, tire him
      by the obstinacy of begging lips and give caresses lavished with neither
      rhyme nor reason.

 Trust in the advice of my experience. First, never kiss your husband in
      public, in the train, at the restaurant. It is bad taste; do not give in
      to your desires. He would feel ridiculous and would never forgive you.

 Beware of useless kisses lavished in intimacy. I am sure that you abuse
      them. For instance, I remember one day that you did something quite
      shocking. Probably you do not remember it.

 All three of us were together in the drawing-room, and, as you did not
      stand on ceremony before me, your husband was holding you on his knees and
      kissing you at great length on the neck, the lips and throat. Suddenly you
      exclaimed: “Oh! the fire!” You had been paying no attention to
      it, and it was almost out. A few lingering embers were glowing on the
      hearth. Then he rose, ran to the woodbox, from which he dragged two
      enormous logs with great difficulty, when you came to him with begging
      lips, murmuring:

 “Kiss me!” He turned his head with difficulty and tried to
      hold up the logs at the same time. Then you gently and slowly placed your
      mouth on that of the poor fellow, who remained with his neck out of joint,
      his sides twisted, his arms almost dropping off, trembling with fatigue
      and tired from his desperate effort. And you kept drawing out this
      torturing kiss, without seeing or understanding. Then when you freed him,
      you began to grumble: “How badly you kiss!” No wonder!

 Oh, take care of that! We all have this foolish habit, this unconscious
      need of choosing the most inconvenient moments. When he is carrying a
      glass of water, when he is putting on his shoes, when he is tying his
      scarf—in short, when he finds himself in any uncomfortable position
      —then is the time which we choose for a caress which makes him stop
      for a whole minute in the middle of a gesture with the sole desire of
      getting rid of us!

 Do not think that this criticism is insignificant. Love, my dear, is a
      delicate thing. The least little thing offends it; know that everything
      depends on the tact of our caresses. An ill-placed kiss may do any amount
      of harm.

 Try following my advice.

 Your old aunt,
                       COLLETTE.
