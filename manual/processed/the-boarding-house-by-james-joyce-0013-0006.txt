THE BOARDING HOUSE

 Mrs Mooney was a butcher’s daughter. She was a woman who was quite able
to keep things to herself: a determined woman. She had married her
father’s foreman and opened a butcher’s shop near Spring Gardens.
But as soon as his father-in-law was dead Mr Mooney began to go to the devil.
He drank, plundered the till, ran headlong into debt. It was no use making him
take the pledge: he was sure to break out again a few days after. By fighting
his wife in the presence of customers and by buying bad meat he ruined his
business. One night he went for his wife with the cleaver and she had to sleep
in a neighbour’s house.

 After that they lived apart. She went to the priest and got a separation from
him with care of the children. She would give him neither money nor food nor
house-room; and so he was obliged to enlist himself as a sheriff’s man.
He was a shabby stooped little drunkard with a white face and a white moustache
and white eyebrows, pencilled above his little eyes, which were pink-veined and
raw; and all day long he sat in the bailiff’s room, waiting to be put on
a job. Mrs Mooney, who had taken what remained of her money out of the butcher
business and set up a boarding house in Hardwicke Street, was a big imposing
woman. Her house had a floating population made up of tourists from Liverpool
and the Isle of Man and, occasionally, artistes from the music-halls.
Its resident population was made up of clerks from the city. She governed her
house cunningly and firmly, knew when to give credit, when to be stern and when
to let things pass. All the resident young men spoke of her as The
Madam .

 Mrs Mooney’s young men paid fifteen shillings a week for board and
lodgings (beer or stout at dinner excluded). They shared in common tastes and
occupations and for this reason they were very chummy with one another. They
discussed with one another the chances of favourites and outsiders. Jack
Mooney, the Madam’s son, who was clerk to a commission agent in Fleet
Street, had the reputation of being a hard case. He was fond of using
soldiers’ obscenities: usually he came home in the small hours. When he
met his friends he had always a good one to tell them and he was always sure to
be on to a good thing—that is to say, a likely horse or a likely artiste . He was also handy with the mits and sang comic songs. On Sunday
nights there would often be a reunion in Mrs Mooney’s front drawing-room.
The music-hall artistes would oblige; and Sheridan played waltzes and
polkas and vamped accompaniments. Polly Mooney, the Madam’s daughter,
would also sing. She sang:

  I’m a ... naughty girl. 

You needn’t sham: 

You know I am. 

 Polly was a slim girl of nineteen; she had light soft hair and a small full
mouth. Her eyes, which were grey with a shade of green through them, had a
habit of glancing upwards when she spoke with anyone, which made her look like
a little perverse madonna. Mrs Mooney had first sent her daughter to be a
typist in a corn-factor’s office but, as a disreputable sheriff’s
man used to come every other day to the office, asking to be allowed to say a
word to his daughter, she had taken her daughter home again and set her to do
housework. As Polly was very lively the intention was to give her the run of
the young men. Besides, young men like to feel that there is a young woman not
very far away. Polly, of course, flirted with the young men but Mrs Mooney, who
was a shrewd judge, knew that the young men were only passing the time away:
none of them meant business. Things went on so for a long time and Mrs Mooney
began to think of sending Polly back to typewriting when she noticed that
something was going on between Polly and one of the young men. She watched the
pair and kept her own counsel.

 Polly knew that she was being watched, but still her mother’s persistent
silence could not be misunderstood. There had been no open complicity between
mother and daughter, no open understanding but, though people in the house
began to talk of the affair, still Mrs Mooney did not intervene. Polly began to
grow a little strange in her manner and the young man was evidently perturbed.
At last, when she judged it to be the right moment, Mrs Mooney intervened. She
dealt with moral problems as a cleaver deals with meat: and in this case she
had made up her mind.

 It was a bright Sunday morning of early summer, promising heat, but with a
fresh breeze blowing. All the windows of the boarding house were open and the
lace curtains ballooned gently towards the street beneath the raised sashes.
The belfry of George’s Church sent out constant peals and worshippers,
singly or in groups, traversed the little circus before the church, revealing
their purpose by their self-contained demeanour no less than by the little
volumes in their gloved hands. Breakfast was over in the boarding house and the
table of the breakfast-room was covered with plates on which lay yellow streaks
of eggs with morsels of bacon-fat and bacon-rind. Mrs Mooney sat in the straw
arm-chair and watched the servant Mary remove the breakfast things. She made
Mary collect the crusts and pieces of broken bread to help to make
Tuesday’s bread-pudding. When the table was cleared, the broken bread
collected, the sugar and butter safe under lock and key, she began to
reconstruct the interview which she had had the night before with Polly. Things
were as she had suspected: she had been frank in her questions and Polly had
been frank in her answers. Both had been somewhat awkward, of course. She had
been made awkward by her not wishing to receive the news in too cavalier a
fashion or to seem to have connived and Polly had been made awkward not merely
because allusions of that kind always made her awkward but also because she did
not wish it to be thought that in her wise innocence she had divined the
intention behind her mother’s tolerance.

 Mrs Mooney glanced instinctively at the little gilt clock on the mantelpiece as
soon as she had become aware through her revery that the bells of
George’s Church had stopped ringing. It was seventeen minutes past
eleven: she would have lots of time to have the matter out with Mr Doran and
then catch short twelve at Marlborough Street. She was sure she would win. To
begin with she had all the weight of social opinion on her side: she was an
outraged mother. She had allowed him to live beneath her roof, assuming that he
was a man of honour, and he had simply abused her hospitality. He was
thirty-four or thirty-five years of age, so that youth could not be pleaded as
his excuse; nor could ignorance be his excuse since he was a man who had seen
something of the world. He had simply taken advantage of Polly’s youth
and inexperience: that was evident. The question was: What reparation would he
make?

 There must be reparation made in such cases. It is all very well for the man:
he can go his ways as if nothing had happened, having had his moment of
pleasure, but the girl has to bear the brunt. Some mothers would be content to
patch up such an affair for a sum of money; she had known cases of it. But she
would not do so. For her only one reparation could make up for the loss of her
daughter’s honour: marriage.

 She counted all her cards again before sending Mary up to Mr Doran’s room
to say that she wished to speak with him. She felt sure she would win. He was a
serious young man, not rakish or loud-voiced like the others. If it had been Mr
Sheridan or Mr Meade or Bantam Lyons her task would have been much harder. She
did not think he would face publicity. All the lodgers in the house knew
something of the affair; details had been invented by some. Besides, he had
been employed for thirteen years in a great Catholic wine-merchant’s
office and publicity would mean for him, perhaps, the loss of his job. Whereas
if he agreed all might be well. She knew he had a good screw for one thing and
she suspected he had a bit of stuff put by.

 Nearly the half-hour! She stood up and surveyed herself in the pier-glass. The
decisive expression of her great florid face satisfied her and she thought of
some mothers she knew who could not get their daughters off their hands.

 Mr Doran was very anxious indeed this Sunday morning. He had made two attempts
to shave but his hand had been so unsteady that he had been obliged to desist.
Three days’ reddish beard fringed his jaws and every two or three minutes
a mist gathered on his glasses so that he had to take them off and polish them
with his pocket-handkerchief. The recollection of his confession of the night
before was a cause of acute pain to him; the priest had drawn out every
ridiculous detail of the affair and in the end had so magnified his sin that he
was almost thankful at being afforded a loophole of reparation. The harm was
done. What could he do now but marry her or run away? He could not brazen it
out. The affair would be sure to be talked of and his employer would be certain
to hear of it. Dublin is such a small city: everyone knows everyone
else’s business. He felt his heart leap warmly in his throat as he heard
in his excited imagination old Mr Leonard calling out in his rasping voice:
“Send Mr Doran here, please.”

 All his long years of service gone for nothing! All his industry and diligence
thrown away! As a young man he had sown his wild oats, of course; he had
boasted of his free-thinking and denied the existence of God to his companions
in public-houses. But that was all passed and done with ... nearly. He still
bought a copy of Reynolds’s Newspaper every week but he attended
to his religious duties and for nine-tenths of the year lived a regular life.
He had money enough to settle down on; it was not that. But the family would
look down on her. First of all there was her disreputable father and then her
mother’s boarding house was beginning to get a certain fame. He had a
notion that he was being had. He could imagine his friends talking of the
affair and laughing. She was a little vulgar; sometimes she said
“I seen” and “If I had’ve known.” But what would
grammar matter if he really loved her? He could not make up his mind whether to
like her or despise her for what she had done. Of course he had done it too.
His instinct urged him to remain free, not to marry. Once you are married you
are done for, it said.

 While he was sitting helplessly on the side of the bed in shirt and trousers
she tapped lightly at his door and entered. She told him all, that she had made
a clean breast of it to her mother and that her mother would speak with him
that morning. She cried and threw her arms round his neck, saying:

 “O Bob! Bob! What am I to do? What am I to do at all?”

 She would put an end to herself, she said.

 He comforted her feebly, telling her not to cry, that it would be all right,
never fear. He felt against his shirt the agitation of her bosom.

 It was not altogether his fault that it had happened. He remembered well, with
the curious patient memory of the celibate, the first casual caresses her
dress, her breath, her fingers had given him. Then late one night as he was
undressing for bed she had tapped at his door, timidly. She wanted to relight
her candle at his for hers had been blown out by a gust. It was her bath night.
She wore a loose open combing-jacket of printed flannel. Her white instep shone
in the opening of her furry slippers and the blood glowed warmly behind her
perfumed skin. From her hands and wrists too as she lit and steadied her candle
a faint perfume arose.

 On nights when he came in very late it was she who warmed up his dinner. He
scarcely knew what he was eating, feeling her beside him alone, at night, in
the sleeping house. And her thoughtfulness! If the night was anyway cold or wet
or windy there was sure to be a little tumbler of punch ready for him. Perhaps
they could be happy together....

 They used to go upstairs together on tiptoe, each with a candle, and on the
third landing exchange reluctant good-nights. They used to kiss. He remembered
well her eyes, the touch of her hand and his delirium....

 But delirium passes. He echoed her phrase, applying it to himself: “What am I to do?” The instinct of the celibate warned him
to hold back. But the sin was there; even his sense of honour told him that
reparation must be made for such a sin.

 While he was sitting with her on the side of the bed Mary came to the door and
said that the missus wanted to see him in the parlour. He stood up to put on
his coat and waistcoat, more helpless than ever. When he was dressed he went
over to her to comfort her. It would be all right, never fear. He left her
crying on the bed and moaning softly: “O my God!” 

 Going down the stairs his glasses became so dimmed with moisture that he had to
take them off and polish them. He longed to ascend through the roof and fly
away to another country where he would never hear again of his trouble, and yet
a force pushed him downstairs step by step. The implacable faces of his
employer and of the Madam stared upon his discomfiture. On the last flight of
stairs he passed Jack Mooney who was coming up from the pantry nursing two
bottles of Bass . They saluted coldly; and the lover’s eyes rested
for a second or two on a thick bulldog face and a pair of thick short arms.
When he reached the foot of the staircase he glanced up and saw Jack regarding
him from the door of the return-room.

 Suddenly he remembered the night when one of the music-hall artistes , a
little blond Londoner, had made a rather free allusion to Polly. The reunion
had been almost broken up on account of Jack’s violence. Everyone tried
to quiet him. The music-hall artiste , a little paler than usual, kept
smiling and saying that there was no harm meant: but Jack kept shouting at him
that if any fellow tried that sort of a game on with his sister
he’d bloody well put his teeth down his throat, so he would.

  Polly sat for a little time on the side of the bed, crying. Then she dried her
eyes and went over to the looking-glass. She dipped the end of the towel in the
water-jug and refreshed her eyes with the cool water. She looked at herself in
profile and readjusted a hairpin above her ear. Then she went back to the bed
again and sat at the foot. She regarded the pillows for a long time and the
sight of them awakened in her mind secret amiable memories. She rested the nape
of her neck against the cool iron bed-rail and fell into a revery. There was no
longer any perturbation visible on her face.

 She waited on patiently, almost cheerfully, without alarm, her memories
gradually giving place to hopes and visions of the future. Her hopes and
visions were so intricate that she no longer saw the white pillows on which her
gaze was fixed or remembered that she was waiting for anything.

 At last she heard her mother calling. She started to her feet and ran to the
banisters.

 “Polly! Polly!”

 “Yes, mamma?”

 “Come down, dear. Mr Doran wants to speak to you.”

 Then she remembered what she had been waiting for.
