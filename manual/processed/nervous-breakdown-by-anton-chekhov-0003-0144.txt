A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN
    

A MEDICAL student
      called Mayer, and a pupil of the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture, and
      Architecture called Rybnikov, went one evening to see their friend
      Vassilyev, a law student, and suggested that he should go with them to S.
      Street. For a long time Vassilyev would not consent to go, but in the end
      he put on his greatcoat and went with them.
    

      He knew nothing of fallen women except by hearsay and from books, and he
      had never in his life been in the houses in which they live. He knew that
      there are immoral women who, under the pressure of fatal circumstances—environment,
      bad education, poverty, and so on—are forced to sell their honor for
      money. They know nothing of pure love, have no children, have no civil
      rights; their mothers and sisters weep over them as though they were dead,
      science treats of them as an evil, men address them with contemptuous
      familiarity. But in spite of all that, they do not lose the semblance and
      image of God. They all acknowledge their sin and hope for salvation. Of
      the means that lead to salvation they can avail themselves to the fullest
      extent. Society, it is true, will not forgive people their past, but in
      the sight of God St. Mary of Egypt is no lower than the other saints. When
      it had happened to Vassilyev in the street to recognize a fallen woman as
      such, by her dress or her manners, or to see a picture of one in a comic
      paper, he always remembered a story he had once read: a young man, pure
      and self-sacrificing, loves a fallen woman and urges her to become his
      wife; she, considering herself unworthy of such happiness, takes poison.
    

      Vassilyev lived in one of the side streets turning out of Tverskoy
      Boulevard. When he came out of the house with his two friends it was about
      eleven o’clock. The first snow had not long fallen, and all nature
      was under the spell of the fresh snow. There was the smell of snow in the
      air, the snow crunched softly under the feet; the earth, the roofs, the
      trees, the seats on the boulevard, everything was soft, white, young, and
      this made the houses look quite different from the day before; the street
      lamps burned more brightly, the air was more transparent, the carriages
      rumbled with a deeper note, and with the fresh, light, frosty air a
      feeling stirred in the soul akin to the white, youthful, feathery snow.
      “Against my will an unknown force,” hummed the medical student
      in his agreeable tenor, “has led me to these mournful shores.”
    

      “Behold the mill...” the artist seconded him, “in ruins
      now....”
    

      “Behold the mill... in ruins now,” the medical student
      repeated, raising his eyebrows and shaking his head mournfully.
    

      He paused, rubbed his forehead, trying to remember the words, and then
      sang aloud, so well that passers-by looked round:
    

“Here in old days when I was free,
Love, free, unfettered, greeted me.”


      The three of them went into a restaurant and, without taking off their
      greatcoats, drank a couple of glasses of vodka each. Before drinking the
      second glass, Vassilyev noticed a bit of cork in his vodka, raised the
      glass to his eyes, and gazed into it for a long time, screwing up his
      shortsighted eyes. The medical student did not understand his expression,
      and said:
    

      “Come, why look at it? No philosophizing, please. Vodka is given us
      to be drunk, sturgeon to be eaten, women to be visited, snow to be walked
      upon. For one evening anyway live like a human being!”
    

      “But I haven’t said anything...” said Vassilyev,
      laughing. “Am I refusing to?”
    

      There was a warmth inside him from the vodka. He looked with softened
      feelings at his friends, admired them and envied them. In these strong,
      healthy, cheerful people how wonderfully balanced everything is, how
      finished and smooth is everything in their minds and souls! They sing, and
      have a passion for the theatre, and draw, and talk a great deal, and
      drink, and they don’t have headaches the day after; they are both
      poetical and debauched, both soft and hard; they can work, too, and be
      indignant, and laugh without reason, and talk nonsense; they are warm,
      honest, self-sacrificing, and as men are in no way inferior to himself,
      Vassilyev, who watched over every step he took and every word he uttered,
      who was fastidious and cautious, and ready to raise every trifle to the
      level of a problem. And he longed for one evening to live as his friends
      did, to open out, to let himself loose from his own control. If vodka had
      to be drunk, he would drink it, though his head would be splitting next
      morning. If he were taken to the women he would go. He would laugh, play
      the fool, gaily respond to the passing advances of strangers in the
      street....
    

      He went out of the restaurant laughing. He liked his friends—one in
      a crushed broad-brimmed hat, with an affectation of artistic untidiness;
      the other in a sealskin cap, a man not poor, though he affected to belong
      to the Bohemia of learning. He liked the snow, the pale street lamps, the
      sharp black tracks left in the first snow by the feet of the passers-by.
      He liked the air, and especially that limpid, tender, naive, as it were
      virginal tone, which can be seen in nature only twice in the year—when
      everything is covered with snow, and in spring on bright days and
      moonlight evenings when the ice breaks on the river.
    

“Against my will an unknown force,
Has led me to these mournful shores,”


      he hummed in an undertone.
    

      And the tune for some reason haunted him and his friends all the way, and
      all three of them hummed it mechanically, not in time with one another.
    

      Vassilyev’s imagination was picturing how, in another ten minutes,
      he and his friends would knock at a door; how by little dark passages and
      dark rooms they would steal in to the women; how, taking advantage of the
      darkness, he would strike a match, would light up and see the face of a
      martyr and a guilty smile. The unknown, fair or dark, would certainly have
      her hair down and be wearing a white dressing-jacket; she would be
      panic-stricken by the light, would be fearfully confused, and would say:
      “For God’s sake, what are you doing! Put it out!” It
      would all be dreadful, but interesting and new.
    

      The friends turned out of Trubnoy Square into Gratchevka, and soon reached
      the side street which Vassilyev only knew by reputation. Seeing two rows
      of houses with brightly lighted windows and wide-open doors, and hearing
      gay strains of pianos and violins, sounds which floated out from every
      door and mingled in a strange chaos, as though an unseen orchestra were
      tuning up in the darkness above the roofs, Vassilyev was surprised and
      said:
    

      “What a lot of houses!”
    

      “That’s nothing,” said the medical student. “In
      London there are ten times as many. There are about a hundred thousand
      such women there.”
    

      The cabmen were sitting on their boxes as calmly and indifferently as in
      any other side street; the same passers-by were walking along the pavement
      as in other streets. No one was hurrying, no one was hiding his face in
      his coat-collar, no one shook his head reproachfully.... And in this
      indifference to the noisy chaos of pianos and violins, to the bright
      windows and wide-open doors, there was a feeling of something very open,
      insolent, reckless, and devil-may-care. Probably it was as gay and noisy
      at the slave-markets in their day, and people’s faces and movements
      showed the same indifference.
    

      “Let us begin from the beginning,” said the artist.
    

      The friends went into a narrow passage lighted by a lamp with a reflector.
      When they opened the door a man in a black coat, with an unshaven face
      like a flunkey’s, and sleepy-looking eyes, got up lazily from a
      yellow sofa in the hall. The place smelt like a laundry with an odor of
      vinegar in addition. A door from the hall led into a brightly lighted
      room. The medical student and the artist stopped at this door and, craning
      their necks, peeped into the room.
    

      “Buona sera, signori, rigolleto—hugenotti—traviata!”
      began the artist, with a theatrical bow.
    

      “Havanna—tarakano—pistoleto!” said the medical
      student, pressing his cap to his breast and bowing low.
    

      Vassilyev was standing behind them. He would have liked to make a
      theatrical bow and say something silly, too, but he only smiled, felt an
      awkwardness that was like shame, and waited impatiently for what would
      happen next.
    

      A little fair girl of seventeen or eighteen, with short hair, in a short
      light-blue frock with a bunch of white ribbon on her bosom, appeared in
      the doorway.
    

      “Why do you stand at the door?” she said. “Take off your
      coats and come into the drawing-room.”
    

      The medical student and the artist, still talking Italian, went into the
      drawing-room. Vassilyev followed them irresolutely.
    

      “Gentlemen, take off your coats!” the flunkey said sternly;
      “you can’t go in like that.”
    

      In the drawing-room there was, besides the girl, another woman, very stout
      and tall, with a foreign face and bare arms. She was sitting near the
      piano, laying out a game of patience on her lap. She took no notice
      whatever of the visitors.
    

      “Where are the other young ladies?” asked the medical student.
    

      “They are having their tea,” said the fair girl. “Stepan,”
      she called, “go and tell the young ladies some students have come!”
    

      A little later a third young lady came into the room. She was wearing a
      bright red dress with blue stripes. Her face was painted thickly and
      unskillfully, her brow was hidden under her hair, and there was an
      unbHlinking, frightened stare in her eyes. As she came in, she began at
      once singing some song in a coarse, powerful contralto. After her a fourth
      appeared, and after her a fifth....
    

      In all this Vassilyev saw nothing new or interesting. It seemed to him
      that that room, the piano, the looking-glass in its cheap gilt frame, the
      bunch of white ribbon, the dress with the blue stripes, and the blank
      indifferent faces, he had seen before and more than once. Of the darkness,
      the silence, the secrecy, the guilty smile, of all that he had expected to
      meet here and had dreaded, he saw no trace.
    

      Everything was ordinary, prosaic, and uninteresting. Only one thing
      faintly stirred his curiosity—the terrible, as it were intentionally
      designed, bad taste which was visible in the cornices, in the absurd
      pictures, in the dresses, in the bunch of ribbons. There was something
      characteristic and peculiar in this bad taste.
    

      “How poor and stupid it all is!” thought Vassilyev. “What
      is there in all this trumpery I see now that can tempt a normal man and
      excite him to commit the horrible sin of buying a human being for a
      rouble? I understand any sin for the sake of splendor, beauty, grace,
      passion, taste; but what is there here? What is there here worth sinning
      for? But... one mustn’t think!”
    

      “Beardy, treat me to some porter!” said the fair girl,
      addressing him.
    

      Vassilyev was at once overcome with confusion.
    

      “With pleasure,” he said, bowing politely. “Only excuse
      me, madam, I.... I won’t drink with you. I don’t drink.”
    

      Five minutes later the friends went off into another house.
    

      “Why did you ask for porter?” said the medical student
      angrily. “What a millionaire! You have thrown away six roubles for
      no reason whatever—simply waste!”
    

      “If she wants it, why not let her have the pleasure?” said
      Vassilyev, justifying himself.
    

      “You did not give pleasure to her, but to the ‘Madam.’
      They are told to ask the visitors to stand them treat because it is a
      profit to the keeper.”
    

      “Behold the mill...” hummed the artist, “in ruins
      now....”
    

      Going into the next house, the friends stopped in the hall and did not go
      into the drawing-room. Here, as in the first house, a figure in a black
      coat, with a sleepy face like a flunkey’s, got up from a sofa in the
      hall. Looking at this flunkey, at his face and his shabby black coat,
      Vassilyev thought: “What must an ordinary simple Russian have gone
      through before fate flung him down as a flunkey here? Where had he been
      before and what had he done? What was awaiting him? Was he married? Where
      was his mother, and did she know that he was a servant here?” And
      Vassilyev could not help particularly noticing the flunkey in each house.
      In one of the houses—he thought it was the fourth—there was a
      little spare, frail-looking flunkey with a watch-chain on his waistcoat.
      He was reading a newspaper, and took no notice of them when they went in.
      Looking at his face Vassilyev, for some reason, thought that a man with
      such a face might steal, might murder, might bear false witness. But the
      face was really interesting: a big forehead, gray eyes, a little flattened
      nose, thin compressed lips, and a blankly stupid and at the same time
      insolent expression like that of a young harrier overtaking a hare.
      Vassilyev thought it would be nice to touch this man’s hair, to see
      whether it was soft or coarse. It must be coarse like a dog’s.
    

      III
    

      Having drunk two glasses of porter, the artist became suddenly tipsy and
      grew unnaturally lively.
    

      “Let’s go to another!” he said peremptorily, waving his
      hands. “I will take you to the best one.”
    

      When he had brought his friends to the house which in his opinion was the
      best, he declared his firm intention of dancing a quadrille. The medical
      student grumbled something about their having to pay the musicians a
      rouble, but agreed to be his vis-a-vis. They began dancing.
    

      It was just as nasty in the best house as in the worst. Here there were
      just the same looking-glasses and pictures, the same styles of coiffure
      and dress. Looking round at the furnishing of the rooms and the costumes,
      Vassilyev realized that this was not lack of taste, but something that
      might be called the taste, and even the style, of S. Street, which could
      not be found elsewhere—something intentional in its ugliness, not
      accidental, but elaborated in the course of years. After he had been in
      eight houses he was no longer surprised at the color of the dresses, at
      the long trains, the gaudy ribbons, the sailor dresses, and the thick
      purplish rouge on the cheeks; he saw that it all had to be like this, that
      if a single one of the women had been dressed like a human being, or if
      there had been one decent engraving on the wall, the general tone of the
      whole street would have suffered.
    

      “How unskillfully they sell themselves!” he thought. “How
      can they fail to understand that vice is only alluring when it is
      beautiful and hidden, when it wears the mask of virtue? Modest black
      dresses, pale faces, mournful smiles, and darkness would be far more
      effective than this clumsy tawdriness. Stupid things! If they don’t
      understand it of themselves, their visitors might surely have taught
      them....”
    

      A young lady in a Polish dress edged with white fur came up to him and sat
      down beside him.
    

      “You nice dark man, why aren’t you dancing?” she asked.
      “Why are you so dull?”
    

      “Because it is dull.”
    

      “Treat me to some Lafitte. Then it won’t be dull.”
    

      Vassilyev made no answer. He was silent for a little, and then asked:
    

      “What time do you get to sleep?”
    

      “At six o’clock.”
    

      “And what time do you get up?”
    

      “Sometimes at two and sometimes at three.”
    

      “And what do you do when you get up?”
    

      “We have coffee, and at six o’clock we have dinner.”
    

      “And what do you have for dinner?”
    

      “Usually soup, beefsteak, and dessert. Our madam keeps the girls
      well. But why do you ask all this?”
    

      “Oh, just to talk....”
    

      Vassilyev longed to talk to the young lady about many things. He felt an
      intense desire to find out where she came from, whether her parents were
      living, and whether they knew that she was here; how she had come into
      this house; whether she were cheerful and satisfied, or sad and oppressed
      by gloomy thoughts; whether she hoped some day to get out of her present
      position.... But he could not think how to begin or in what shape to put
      his questions so as not to seem impertinent. He thought for a long time,
      and asked:
    

      “How old are you?”
    

      “Eighty,” the young lady jested, looking with a laugh at the
      antics of the artist as he danced.
    

      All at once she burst out laughing at something, and uttered a long
      cynical sentence loud enough to be heard by everyone. Vassilyev was
      aghast, and not knowing how to look, gave a constrained smile. He was the
      only one who smiled; all the others, his friends, the musicians, the
      women, did not even glance towards his neighbor, but seemed not to have
      heard her.
    

      “Stand me some Lafitte,” his neighbor said again.
    

      Vassilyev felt a repulsion for her white fur and for her voice, and walked
      away from her. It seemed to him hot and stifling, and his heart began
      throbbing slowly but violently, like a hammer—one! two! three!
    

      “Let us go away!” he said, pulling the artist by his sleeve.
    

      “Wait a little; let me finish.”
    

      While the artist and the medical student were finishing the quadrille, to
      avoid looking at the women, Vassilyev scrutinized the musicians. A
      respectable-looking old man in spectacles, rather like Marshal Bazaine,
      was playing the piano; a young man with a fair beard, dressed in the
      latest fashion, was playing the violin. The young man had a face that did
      not look stupid nor exhausted, but intelligent, youthful, and fresh. He
      was dressed fancifully and with taste; he played with feeling. It was a
      mystery how he and the respectable-looking old man had come here. How was
      it they were not ashamed to sit here? What were they thinking about when
      they looked at the women?
    

      If the violin and the piano had been played by men in rags, looking
      hungry, gloomy, drunken, with dissipated or stupid faces, then one could
      have understood their presence, perhaps. As it was, Vassilyev could not
      understand it at all. He recalled the story of the fallen woman he had
      once read, and he thought now that that human figure with the guilty smile
      had nothing in common with what he was seeing now. It seemed to him that
      he was seeing not fallen women, but some different world quite apart,
      alien to him and incomprehensible; if he had seen this world before on the
      stage, or read of it in a book, he would not have believed in it....
    

      The woman with the white fur burst out laughing again and uttered a
      loathsome sentence in a loud voice. A feeling of disgust took possession
      of him. He flushed crimson and went out of the room.
    

      “Wait a minute, we are coming too!” the artist shouted to him.
    

      IV
    

      “While we were dancing,” said the medical student, as they all
      three went out into the street, “I had a conversation with my
      partner. We talked about her first romance. He, the hero, was an
      accountant at Smolensk with a wife and five children. She was seventeen,
      and she lived with her papa and mamma, who sold soap and candles.”
    

      “How did he win her heart?” asked Vassilyev.
    

      “By spending fifty roubles on underclothes for her. What next!”
    

      “So he knew how to get his partner’s story out of her,”
      thought Vassilyev about the medical student. “But I don’t know
      how to.”
    

      “I say, I am going home!” he said.
    

      “What for?”
    

      “Because I don’t know how to behave here. Besides, I am bored,
      disgusted. What is there amusing in it? If they were human beings—but
      they are savages and animals. I am going; do as you like.”
    

      “Come, Grisha, Grigory, darling...” said the artist in a
      tearful voice, hugging Vassilyev, “come along! Let’s go to one
      more together and damnation take them!... Please do, Grisha!”
    

      They persuaded Vassilyev and led him up a staircase. In the carpet and the
      gilt banisters, in the porter who opened the door, and in the panels that
      decorated the hall, the same S. Street style was apparent, but carried to
      a greater perfection, more imposing.
    

      “I really will go home!” said Vassilyev as he was taking off
      his coat.
    

      “Come, come, dear boy,” said the artist, and he kissed him on
      the neck. “Don’t be tiresome.... Gri-gri, be a good comrade!
      We came together, we will go back together. What a beast you are, really!”
    

      “I can wait for you in the street. I think it’s loathsome,
      really!”
    

      “Come, come, Grisha.... If it is loathsome, you can observe it! Do
      you understand? You can observe!”
    

      “One must take an objective view of things,” said the medical
      student gravely.
    

      Vassilyev went into the drawing-room and sat down. There were a number of
      visitors in the room besides him and his friends: two infantry officers, a
      bald, gray-haired gentleman in spectacles, two beardless youths from the
      institute of land-surveying, and a very tipsy man who looked like an
      actor. All the young ladies were taken up with these visitors and paid no
      attention to Vassilyev.
    

      Only one of them, dressed a la Aida, glanced sideways at him,
      smiled, and said, yawning: “A dark one has come....”
    

      Vassilyev’s heart was throbbing and his face burned. He felt ashamed
      before these visitors of his presence here, and he felt disgusted and
      miserable. He was tormented by the thought that he, a decent and loving
      man (such as he had hitherto considered himself), hated these women and
      felt nothing but repulsion towards them. He felt pity neither for the
      women nor the musicians nor the flunkeys.
    

      “It is because I am not trying to understand them,” he
      thought. “They are all more like animals than human beings, but of
      course they are human beings all the same, they have souls. One must
      understand them and then judge....”
    

      “Grisha, don’t go, wait for us,” the artist shouted to
      him and disappeared.
    

      The medical student disappeared soon after.
    

      “Yes, one must make an effort to understand, one mustn’t be
      like this....” Vassilyev went on thinking.
    

      And he began gazing at each of the women with strained attention, looking
      for a guilty smile. But either he did not know how to read their faces, or
      not one of these women felt herself to be guilty; he read on every face
      nothing but a blank expression of everyday vulgar boredom and complacency.
      Stupid faces, stupid smiles, harsh, stupid voices, insolent movements, and
      nothing else. Apparently each of them had in the past a romance with an
      accountant based on underclothes for fifty roubles, and looked for no
      other charm in the present but coffee, a dinner of three courses, wines,
      quadrilles, sleeping till two in the afternoon....
    

      Finding no guilty smile, Vassilyev began to look whether there was not one
      intelligent face. And his attention was caught by one pale, rather sleepy,
      exhausted-looking face.... It was a dark woman, not very young, wearing a
      dress covered with spangles; she was sitting in an easy-chair, looking at
      the floor lost in thought. Vassilyev walked from one corner of the room to
      the other, and, as though casually, sat down beside her.
    

      “I must begin with something trivial,” he thought, “and
      pass to what is serious....”
    

      “What a pretty dress you have,” and with his finger he touched
      the gold fringe of her fichu.
    

      “Oh, is it?...” said the dark woman listlessly.
    

      “What province do you come from?”
    

      “I? From a distance.... From Tchernigov.”
    

      “A fine province. It’s nice there.”
    

      “Any place seems nice when one is not in it.”
    

      “It’s a pity I cannot describe nature,” thought
      Vassilyev. “I might touch her by a description of nature in
      Tchernigov. No doubt she loves the place if she has been born there.”
    

      “Are you dull here?” he asked.
    

      “Of course I am dull.”
    

      “Why don’t you go away from here if you are dull?”
    

      “Where should I go to? Go begging or what?”
    

      “Begging would be easier than living here.”
    

      “How do you know that? Have you begged?”
    

      “Yes, when I hadn’t the money to study. Even if I hadn’t
      anyone could understand that. A beggar is anyway a free man, and you are a
      slave.”
    

      The dark woman stretched, and watched with sleepy eyes the footman who was
      bringing a trayful of glasses and seltzer water.
    

      “Stand me a glass of porter,” she said, and yawned again.
    

      “Porter,” thought Vassilyev. “And what if your brother
      or mother walked in at this moment? What would you say? And what would
      they say? There would be porter then, I imagine....”
    

      All at once there was the sound of weeping. From the adjoining room, from
      which the footman had brought the seltzer water, a fair man with a red
      face and angry eyes ran in quickly. He was followed by the tall, stout
      “madam,” who was shouting in a shrill voice:
    

      “Nobody has given you leave to slap girls on the cheeks! We have
      visitors better than you, and they don’t fight! Impostor!”
    

      A hubbub arose. Vassilyev was frightened and turned pale. In the next room
      there was the sound of bitter, genuine weeping, as though of someone
      insulted. And he realized that there were real people living here who,
      like people everywhere else, felt insulted, suffered, wept, and cried for
      help. The feeling of oppressive hate and disgust gave way to an acute
      feeling of pity and anger against the aggressor. He rushed into the room
      where there was weeping. Across rows of bottles on a marble-top table he
      distinguished a suffering face, wet with tears, stretched out his hands
      towards that face, took a step towards the table, but at once drew back in
      horror. The weeping girl was drunk.
    

      As he made his way though the noisy crowd gathered about the fair man, his
      heart sank and he felt frightened like a child; and it seemed to him that
      in this alien, incomprehensible world people wanted to pursue him, to beat
      him, to pelt him with filthy words.... He tore down his coat from the
      hatstand and ran headlong downstairs.
    

      V
    

      Leaning against the fence, he stood near the house waiting for his friends
      to come out. The sounds of the pianos and violins, gay, reckless,
      insolent, and mournful, mingled in the air in a sort of chaos, and this
      tangle of sounds seemed again like an unseen orchestra tuning up on the
      roofs. If one looked upwards into the darkness, the black background was
      all spangled with white, moving spots: it was snow falling. As the
      snowflakes came into the light they floated round lazily in the air like
      down, and still more lazily fell to the ground. The snowflakes whirled
      thickly round Vassilyev and hung upon his beard, his eyelashes, his
      eyebrows.... The cabmen, the horses, and the passers-by were white.
    

      “And how can the snow fall in this street!” thought Vassilyev.
      “Damnation take these houses!”
    

      His legs seemed to be giving way from fatigue, simply from having run down
      the stairs; he gasped for breath as though he had been climbing uphill,
      his heart beat so loudly that he could hear it. He was consumed by a
      desire to get out of the street as quickly as possible and to go home, but
      even stronger was his desire to wait for his companions and vent upon them
      his oppressive feeling.
    

      There was much he did not understand in these houses, the souls of ruined
      women were a mystery to him as before; but it was clear to him that the
      thing was far worse than could have been believed. If that sinful woman
      who had poisoned herself was called fallen, it was difficult to find a
      fitting name for all these who were dancing now to this tangle of sound
      and uttering long, loathsome sentences. They were not on the road to ruin,
      but ruined.
    

      “There is vice,” he thought, “but neither consciousness
      of sin nor hope of salvation. They are sold and bought, steeped in wine
      and abominations, while they, like sheep, are stupid, indifferent, and don’t
      understand. My God! My God!”
    

      It was clear to him, too, that everything that is called human dignity,
      personal rights, the Divine image and semblance, were defiled to their
      very foundations—“to the very marrow,” as drunkards say—and
      that not only the street and the stupid women were responsible for it.
    

      A group of students, white with snow, passed him laughing and talking
      gaily; one, a tall thin fellow, stopped, glanced into Vassilyev’s
      face, and said in a drunken voice:
    

      “One of us! A bit on, old man? Aha-ha! Never mind, have a good time!
      Don’t be down-hearted, old chap!”
    

      He took Vassilyev by the shoulder and pressed his cold wet mustache
      against his cheek, then he slipped, staggered, and, waving both hands,
      cried:
    

      “Hold on! Don’t upset!”
    

      And laughing, he ran to overtake his companions.
    

      Through the noise came the sound of the artist’s voice:
    

      “Don’t you dare to hit the women! I won’t let you,
      damnation take you! You scoundrels!”
    

      The medical student appeared in the doorway. He looked from side to side,
      and seeing Vassilyev, said in an agitated voice:
    

      “You here! I tell you it’s really impossible to go anywhere
      with Yegor! What a fellow he is! I don’t understand him! He has got
      up a scene! Do you hear? Yegor!” he shouted at the door. “Yegor!”
    

      “I won’t allow you to hit women!” the artist’s
      piercing voice sounded from above. Something heavy and lumbering rolled
      down the stairs. It was the artist falling headlong. Evidently he had been
      pushed downstairs.
    

      He picked himself up from the ground, shook his hat, and, with an angry
      and indignant face, brandished his fist towards the top of the stairs and
      shouted:
    

      “Scoundrels! Torturers! Bloodsuckers! I won’t allow you to hit
      them! To hit a weak, drunken woman! Oh, you brutes!...”
    

      “Yegor!... Come, Yegor!...” the medical student began
      imploring him. “I give you my word of honor I’ll never come
      with you again. On my word of honor I won’t!”
    

      Little by little the artist was pacified and the friends went homewards.
    

      “Against my will an unknown force,” hummed the medical
      student, “has led me to these mournful shores.”
    

      “Behold the mill,” the artist chimed in a little later,
      “in ruins now. What a lot of snow, Holy Mother! Grisha, why did you
      go? You are a funk, a regular old woman.”
    

      Vassilyev walked behind his companions, looked at their backs, and
      thought:
    

      “One of two things: either we only fancy prostitution is an evil,
      and we exaggerate it; or, if prostitution really is as great an evil as is
      generally assumed, these dear friends of mine are as much slaveowners,
      violators, and murderers, as the inhabitants of Syria and Cairo, that are
      described in the ‘Neva.’ Now they are singing, laughing,
      talking sense, but haven’t they just been exploiting hunger,
      ignorance, and stupidity? They have—I have been a witness of it.
      What is the use of their humanity, their medicine, their painting? The
      science, art, and lofty sentiments of these soul-destroyers remind me of
      the piece of bacon in the story. Two brigands murdered a beggar in a
      forest; they began sharing his clothes between them, and found in his
      wallet a piece of bacon. ‘Well found,’ said one of them,
      ‘let us have a bit.’ ‘What do you mean? How can you?’
      cried the other in horror. ‘Have you forgotten that to-day is
      Wednesday?’ And they would not eat it. After murdering a man, they
      came out of the forest in the firm conviction that they were keeping the
      fast. In the same way these men, after buying women, go their way
      imagining that they are artists and men of science....”
    

      “Listen!” he said sharply and angrily. “Why do you come
      here? Is it possible—is it possible you don’t understand how
      horrible it is? Your medical books tell you that every one of these women
      dies prematurely of consumption or something; art tells you that morally
      they are dead even earlier. Every one of them dies because she has in her
      time to entertain five hundred men on an average, let us say. Each one of
      them is killed by five hundred men. You are among those five hundred! If
      each of you in the course of your lives visits this place or others like
      it two hundred and fifty times, it follows that one woman is killed for
      every two of you! Can’t you understand that? Isn’t it horrible
      to murder, two of you, three of you, five of you, a foolish, hungry woman!
      Ah! isn’t it awful, my God!”
    

      “I knew it would end like that,” the artist said frowning.
      “We ought not to have gone with this fool and ass! You imagine you
      have grand notions in your head now, ideas, don’t you? No, it’s
      the devil knows what, but not ideas. You are looking at me now with hatred
      and repulsion, but I tell you it’s better you should set up twenty
      more houses like those than look like that. There’s more vice in
      your expression than in the whole street! Come along, Volodya, let him go
      to the devil! He’s a fool and an ass, and that’s all....”
    

      “We human beings do murder each other,” said the medical
      student. “It’s immoral, of course, but philosophizing doesn’t
      help it. Good-by!”
    

      At Trubnoy Square the friends said good-by and parted. When he was left
      alone, Vassilyev strode rapidly along the boulevard. He felt frightened of
      the darkness, of the snow which was falling in heavy flakes on the ground,
      and seemed as though it would cover up the whole world; he felt frightened
      of the street lamps shining with pale light through the clouds of snow.
      His soul was possessed by an unaccountable, faint-hearted terror.
      Passers-by came towards him from time to time, but he timidly moved to one
      side; it seemed to him that women, none but women, were coming from all
      sides and staring at him....
    

      “It’s beginning,” he thought, “I am going to have
      a breakdown.”
    

      VI
    

      At home he lay on his bed and said, shuddering all over: “They are
      alive! Alive! My God, those women are alive!”
    

      He encouraged his imagination in all sorts of ways to picture himself the
      brother of a fallen woman, or her father; then a fallen woman herself,
      with her painted cheeks; and it all moved him to horror.
    

      It seemed to him that he must settle the question at once at all costs,
      and that this question was not one that did not concern him, but was his
      own personal problem. He made an immense effort, repressed his despair,
      and, sitting on the bed, holding his head in his hands, began thinking how
      one could save all the women he had seen that day. The method for
      attacking problems of all kinds was, as he was an educated man, well known
      to him. And, however excited he was, he strictly adhered to that method.
      He recalled the history of the problem and its literature, and for a
      quarter of an hour he paced from one end of the room to the other trying
      to remember all the methods practiced at the present time for saving
      women. He had very many good friends and acquaintances who lived in
      lodgings in Petersburg.... Among them were a good many honest and
      self-sacrificing men. Some of them had attempted to save women....
    

      “All these not very numerous attempts,” thought Vassilyev,
      “can be divided into three groups. Some, after buying the woman out
      of the brothel, took a room for her, bought her a sewing-machine, and she
      became a semptress. And whether he wanted to or not, after having bought
      her out he made her his mistress; then when he had taken his degree, he
      went away and handed her into the keeping of some other decent man as
      though she were a thing. And the fallen woman remained a fallen woman.
      Others, after buying her out, took a lodging apart for her, bought the
      inevitable sewing-machine, and tried teaching her to read, preaching at
      her and giving her books. The woman lived and sewed as long as it was
      interesting and a novelty to her, then getting bored, began receiving men
      on the sly, or ran away and went back where she could sleep till three o’clock,
      drink coffee, and have good dinners. The third class, the most ardent and
      self-sacrificing, had taken a bold, resolute step. They had married them.
      And when the insolent and spoilt, or stupid and crushed animal became a
      wife, the head of a household, and afterwards a mother, it turned her
      whole existence and attitude to life upside down, so that it was hard to
      recognize the fallen woman afterwards in the wife and the mother. Yes,
      marriage was the best and perhaps the only means.”
    

      “But it is impossible!” Vassilyev said aloud, and he sank upon
      his bed. “I, to begin with, could not marry one! To do that one must
      be a saint and be unable to feel hatred or repulsion. But supposing that
      I, the medical student, and the artist mastered ourselves and did marry
      them—suppose they were all married. What would be the result? The
      result would be that while here in Moscow they were being married, some
      Smolensk accountant would be debauching another lot, and that lot would be
      streaming here to fill the vacant places, together with others from
      Saratov, Nizhni-Novgorod, Warsaw.... And what is one to do with the
      hundred thousand in London? What’s one to do with those in Hamburg?”
    

      The lamp in which the oil had burnt down began to smoke. Vassilyev did not
      notice it. He began pacing to and fro again, still thinking. Now he put
      the question differently: what must be done that fallen women should not
      be needed? For that, it was essential that the men who buy them and do
      them to death should feel all the immorality of their share in enslaving
      them and should be horrified. One must save the men.
    

      “One won’t do anything by art and science, that is clear...”
      thought Vassilyev. “The only way out of it is missionary work.”
    

      And he began to dream how he would the next evening stand at the corner of
      the street and say to every passer-by: “Where are you going and what
      for? Have some fear of God!”
    

      He would turn to the apathetic cabmen and say to them: “Why are you
      staying here? Why aren’t you revolted? Why aren’t you
      indignant? I suppose you believe in God and know that it is a sin, that
      people go to hell for it? Why don’t you speak? It is true that they
      are strangers to you, but you know even they have fathers, brothers like
      yourselves....”
    

      One of Vassilyev’s friends had once said of him that he was a
      talented man. There are all sorts of talents—talent for writing,
      talent for the stage, talent for art; but he had a peculiar talent—a
      talent for humanity. He possessed an extraordinarily fine delicate
      scent for pain in general. As a good actor reflects in himself the
      movements and voice of others, so Vassilyev could reflect in his soul the
      sufferings of others. When he saw tears, he wept; beside a sick man, he
      felt sick himself and moaned; if he saw an act of violence, he felt as
      though he himself were the victim of it, he was frightened as a child, and
      in his fright ran to help. The pain of others worked on his nerves,
      excited him, roused him to a state of frenzy, and so on.
    

      Whether this friend were right I don’t know, but what Vassilyev
      experienced when he thought this question was settled was something like
      inspiration. He cried and laughed, spoke aloud the words that he should
      say next day, felt a fervent love for those who would listen to him and
      would stand beside him at the corner of the street to preach; he sat down
      to write letters, made vows to himself....
    

      All this was like inspiration also from the fact that it did not last
      long. Vassilyev was soon tired. The cases in London, in Hamburg, in
      Warsaw, weighed upon him by their mass as a mountain weighs upon the
      earth; he felt dispirited, bewildered, in the face of this mass; he
      remembered that he had not a gift for words, that he was cowardly and
      timid, that indifferent people would not be willing to listen and
      understand him, a law student in his third year, a timid and insignificant
      person; that genuine missionary work included not only teaching but
      deeds...
    

      When it was daylight and carriages were already beginning to rumble in the
      street, Vassilyev was lying motionless on the sofa, staring into space. He
      was no longer thinking of the women, nor of the men, nor of missionary
      work. His whole attention was turned upon the spiritual agony which was
      torturing him. It was a dull, vague, undefined anguish akin to misery, to
      an extreme form of terror and to despair. He could point to the place
      where the pain was, in his breast under his heart; but he could not
      compare it with anything. In the past he had had acute toothache, he had
      had pleurisy and neuralgia, but all that was insignificant compared with
      this spiritual anguish. In the presence of that pain life seemed
      loathsome. The dissertation, the excellent work he had written already,
      the people he loved, the salvation of fallen women—everything that
      only the day before he had cared about or been indifferent to, now when he
      thought of them irritated him in the same way as the noise of the
      carriages, the scurrying footsteps of the waiters in the passage, the
      daylight.... If at that moment someone had performed a great deed of mercy
      or had committed a revolting outrage, he would have felt the same
      repulsion for both actions. Of all the thoughts that strayed through his
      mind only two did not irritate him: one was that at every moment he had
      the power to kill himself, the other that this agony would not last more
      than three days. This last he knew by experience.
    

      After lying for a while he got up and, wringing his hands, walked about
      the room, not as usual from corner to corner, but round the room beside
      the walls. As he passed he glanced at himself in the looking-glass. His
      face looked pale and sunken, his temples looked hollow, his eyes were
      bigger, darker, more staring, as though they belonged to someone else, and
      they had an expression of insufferable mental agony.
    

      At midday the artist knocked at the door.
    

      “Grigory, are you at home?” he asked.
    

      Getting no answer, he stood for a minute, pondered, and answered himself
      in Little Russian: “Nay. The confounded fellow has gone to the
      University.”
    

      And he went away. Vassilyev lay down on the bed and, thrusting his head
      under the pillow, began crying with agony, and the more freely his tears
      flowed the more terrible his mental anguish became. As it began to get
      dark, he thought of the agonizing night awaiting him, and was overcome by
      a horrible despair. He dressed quickly, ran out of his room, and, leaving
      his door wide open, for no object or reason, went out into the street.
      Without asking himself where he should go, he walked quickly along Sadovoy
      Street.
    

      Snow was falling as heavily as the day before; it was thawing. Thrusting
      his hands into his sleeves, shuddering and frightened at the noises, at
      the trambells, and at the passers-by, Vassilyev walked along Sadovoy
      Street as far as Suharev Tower; then to the Red Gate; from there he turned
      off to Basmannya Street. He went into a tavern and drank off a big glass
      of vodka, but that did not make him feel better. When he reached Razgulya
      he turned to the right, and strode along side streets in which he had
      never been before in his life. He reached the old bridge by which the
      Yauza runs gurgling, and from which one can see long rows of lights in the
      windows of the Red Barracks. To distract his spiritual anguish by some new
      sensation or some other pain, Vassilyev, not knowing what to do, crying
      and shuddering, undid his greatcoat and jacket and exposed his bare chest
      to the wet snow and the wind. But that did not lessen his suffering
      either. Then he bent down over the rail of the bridge and looked down into
      the black, yeasty Yauza, and he longed to plunge down head foremost; not
      from loathing for life, not for the sake of suicide, but in order to
      bruise himself at least, and by one pain to ease the other. But the black
      water, the darkness, the deserted banks covered with snow were terrifying.
      He shivered and walked on. He walked up and down by the Red Barracks, then
      turned back and went down to a copse, from the copse back to the bridge
      again.
    

      “No, home, home!” he thought. “At home I believe it’s
      better...”
    

      And he went back. When he reached home he pulled off his wet coat and cap,
      began pacing round the room, and went on pacing round and round without
      stopping till morning.
    

      VII
    

      When next morning the artist and the medical student went in to him, he
      was moving about the room with his shirt torn, biting his hands and
      moaning with pain.
    

      “For God’s sake!” he sobbed when he saw his friends,
      “take me where you please, do what you can; but for God’s
      sake, save me quickly! I shall kill myself!”
    

      The artist turned pale and was helpless. The medical student, too, almost
      shed tears, but considering that doctors ought to be cool and composed in
      every emergency said coldly:
    

      “It’s a nervous breakdown. But it’s nothing. Let us go
      at once to the doctor.”
    

      “Wherever you like, only for God’s sake, make haste!”
    

      “Don’t excite yourself. You must try and control yourself.”
    

      The artist and the medical student with trembling hands put Vassilyev’s
      coat and hat on and led him out into the street.
    

      “Mihail Sergeyitch has been wanting to make your acquaintance for a
      long time,” the medical student said on the way. “He is a very
      nice man and thoroughly good at his work. He took his degree in 1882, and
      he has an immense practice already. He treats students as though he were
      one himself.”
    

      “Make haste, make haste!...” Vassilyev urged.
    

      Mihail Sergeyitch, a stout, fair-haired doctor, received the friends with
      politeness and frigid dignity, and smiled only on one side of his face.
    

      “Rybnikov and Mayer have spoken to me of your illness already,”
      he said. “Very glad to be of service to you. Well? Sit down, I
      beg....”
    

      He made Vassilyev sit down in a big armchair near the table, and moved a
      box of cigarettes towards him.
    

      “Now then!” he began, stroking his knees. “Let us get to
      work.... How old are you?”
    

      He asked questions and the medical student answered them. He asked whether
      Vassilyev’s father had suffered from certain special diseases,
      whether he drank to excess, whether he were remarkable for cruelty or any
      peculiarities. He made similar inquiries about his grandfather, mother,
      sisters, and brothers. On learning that his mother had a beautiful voice
      and sometimes acted on the stage, he grew more animated at once, and
      asked:
    

      “Excuse me, but don’t you remember, perhaps, your mother had a
      passion for the stage?”
    

      Twenty minutes passed. Vassilyev was annoyed by the way the doctor kept
      stroking his knees and talking of the same thing.
    

      “So far as I understand your questions, doctor,” he said,
      “you want to know whether my illness is hereditary or not. It is
      not.”
    

      The doctor proceeded to ask Vassilyev whether he had had any secret vices
      as a boy, or had received injuries to his head; whether he had had any
      aberrations, any peculiarities, or exceptional propensities. Half the
      questions usually asked by doctors of their patients can be left
      unanswered without the slightest ill effect on the health, but Mihail
      Sergeyitch, the medical student, and the artist all looked as though if
      Vassilyev failed to answer one question all would be lost. As he received
      answers, the doctor for some reason noted them down on a slip of paper. On
      learning that Vassilyev had taken his degree in natural science, and was
      now studying law, the doctor pondered.
    

      “He wrote a first-rate piece of original work last year,...”
      said the medical student.
    

      “I beg your pardon, but don’t interrupt me; you prevent me
      from concentrating,” said the doctor, and he smiled on one side of
      his face. “Though, of course, that does enter into the diagnosis.
      Intense intellectual work, nervous exhaustion.... Yes, yes.... And do you
      drink vodka?” he said, addressing Vassilyev.
    

      “Very rarely.”
    

      Another twenty minutes passed. The medical student began telling the
      doctor in a low voice his opinion as to the immediate cause of the attack,
      and described how the day before yesterday the artist, Vassilyev, and he
      had visited S. Street.
    

      The indifferent, reserved, and frigid tone in which his friends and the
      doctor spoke of the women and that miserable street struck Vassilyev as
      strange in the extreme....
    

      “Doctor, tell me one thing only,” he said, controlling himself
      so as not to speak rudely. “Is prostitution an evil or not?”
    

      “My dear fellow, who disputes it?” said the doctor, with an
      expression that suggested that he had settled all such questions for
      himself long ago. “Who disputes it?”
    

      “You are a mental doctor, aren’t you?” Vassilyev asked
      curtly.
    

      “Yes, a mental doctor.”
    

      “Perhaps all of you are right!” said Vassilyev, getting up and
      beginning to walk from one end of the room to the other. “Perhaps!
      But it all seems marvelous to me! That I should have taken my degree in
      two faculties you look upon as a great achievement; because I have written
      a work which in three years will be thrown aside and forgotten, I am
      praised up to the skies; but because I cannot speak of fallen women as
      unconcernedly as of these chairs, I am being examined by a doctor, I am
      called mad, I am pitied!”
    

      Vassilyev for some reason felt all at once unutterably sorry for himself,
      and his companions, and all the people he had seen two days before, and
      for the doctor; he burst into tears and sank into a chair.
    

      His friends looked inquiringly at the doctor. The latter, with the air of
      completely comprehending the tears and the despair, of feeling himself a
      specialist in that line, went up to Vassilyev and, without a word, gave
      him some medicine to drink; and then, when he was calmer, undressed him
      and began to investigate the degree of sensibility of the skin, the reflex
      action of the knees, and so on.
    

      And Vassilyev felt easier. When he came out from the doctor’s he was
      beginning to feel ashamed; the rattle of the carriages no longer irritated
      him, and the load at his heart grew lighter and lighter as though it were
      melting away. He had two prescriptions in his hand: one was for bromide,
      one was for morphia.... He had taken all these remedies before.
    

      In the street he stood still and, saying good-by to his friends, dragged
      himself languidly to the University.
