BY WORD OF MOUTH.

 Not though you die tonight, O Sweet, and wail,
     A spectre at my door,
    Shall mortal Fear make Love immortal fail—
     I shall but love you more,
    Who from Death's house returning, give me still
     One moment's comfort in my matchless ill.
                       —Shadow Houses.

 This tale may be explained by those who know how souls are made, and where
      the bounds of the Possible are put down. I have lived long enough in this
      country to know that it is best to know nothing, and can only write the
      story as it happened.

 Dumoise was our Civil Surgeon at Meridki, and we called him “Dormouse,”
       because he was a round little, sleepy little man. He was a good Doctor and
      never quarrelled with any one, not even with our Deputy Commissioner, who
      had the manners of a bargee and the tact of a horse. He married a girl as
      round and as sleepy-looking as himself. She was a Miss Hillardyce,
      daughter of “Squash” Hillardyce of the Berars, who married his Chief's
      daughter by mistake. But that is another story.

 A honeymoon in India is seldom more than a week long; but there is nothing
      to hinder a couple from extending it over two or three years. This is a
      delightful country for married folk who are wrapped up in one another.
      They can live absolutely alone and without interruption—just as the
      Dormice did. These two little people retired from the world after their
      marriage, and were very happy. They were forced, of course, to give
      occasional dinners, but they made no friends hereby, and the Station went
      its own way and forgot them; only saying, occasionally, that Dormouse was
      the best of good fellows, though dull. A Civil Surgeon who never quarrels
      is a rarity, appreciated as such.

 Few people can afford to play Robinson Crusoe anywhere—least of all
      in India, where we are few in the land, and very much dependent on each
      other's kind offices. Dumoise was wrong in shutting himself from the world
      for a year, and he discovered his mistake when an epidemic of typhoid
      broke out in the Station in the heart of the cold weather, and his wife
      went down. He was a shy little man, and five days were wasted before he
      realized that Mrs. Dumoise was burning with something worse than simple
      fever, and three days more passed before he ventured to call on Mrs.
      Shute, the Engineer's wife, and timidly speak about his trouble. Nearly
      every household in India knows that Doctors are very helpless in typhoid.
      The battle must be fought out between Death and the Nurses, minute by
      minute and degree by degree. Mrs. Shute almost boxed Dumoise's ears for
      what she called his “criminal delay,” and went off at once to look after
      the poor girl. We had seven cases of typhoid in the Station that winter
      and, as the average of death is about one in every five cases, we felt
      certain that we should have to lose somebody. But all did their best. The
      women sat up nursing the women, and the men turned to and tended the
      bachelors who were down, and we wrestled with those typhoid cases for
      fifty-six days, and brought them through the Valley of the Shadow in
      triumph. But, just when we thought all was over, and were going to give a
      dance to celebrate the victory, little Mrs. Dumoise got a relapse and died
      in a week and the Station went to the funeral. Dumoise broke down utterly
      at the brink of the grave, and had to be taken away.

 After the death, Dumoise crept into his own house and refused to be
      comforted. He did his duties perfectly, but we all felt that he should go
      on leave, and the other men of his own Service told him so. Dumoise was
      very thankful for the suggestion—he was thankful for anything in
      those days—and went to Chini on a walking-tour.

 Chini is some twenty marches from Simla, in the heart of the Hills, and
      the scenery is good if you are in trouble. You pass through big, still
      deodar-forests, and under big, still cliffs, and over big, still
      grass-downs swelling like a woman's breasts; and the wind across the
      grass, and the rain among the deodars says:—“Hush—hush—hush.”
       So little Dumoise was packed off to Chini, to wear down his grief with a
      full-plate camera, and a rifle. He took also a useless bearer, because the
      man had been his wife's favorite servant. He was idle and a thief, but
      Dumoise trusted everything to him.

 On his way back from Chini, Dumoise turned aside to Bagi, through the
      Forest Reserve which is on the spur of Mount Huttoo. Some men who have
      travelled more than a little say that the march from Kotegarh to Bagi is
      one of the finest in creation. It runs through dark wet forest, and ends
      suddenly in bleak, nipped hill-side and black rocks. Bagi dak-bungalow is
      open to all the winds and is bitterly cold. Few people go to Bagi. Perhaps
      that was the reason why Dumoise went there. He halted at seven in the
      evening, and his bearer went down the hill-side to the village to engage
      coolies for the next day's march. The sun had set, and the night-winds
      were beginning to croon among the rocks. Dumoise leaned on the railing of
      the verandah, waiting for his bearer to return. The man came back almost
      immediately after he had disappeared, and at such a rate that Dumoise
      fancied he must have crossed a bear. He was running as hard as he could up
      the face of the hill.

 But there was no bear to account for his terror. He raced to the verandah
      and fell down, the blood spurting from his nose and his face iron-gray.
      Then he gurgled:—“I have seen the Memsahib! I have seen the
      Memsahib!”

 “Where?” said Dumoise.

 “Down there, walking on the road to the village. She was in a blue dress,
      and she lifted the veil of her bonnet and said:—'Ram Dass, give my
      salaams to the Sahib, and tell him that I shall meet him next month at
      Nuddea.' Then I ran away, because I was afraid.”

 What Dumoise said or did I do not know. Ram Dass declares that he said
      nothing, but walked up and down the verandah all the cold night, waiting
      for the Memsahib to come up the hill and stretching out his arms into the
      dark like a madman. But no Memsahib came, and, next day, he went on to
      Simla cross-questioning the bearer every hour.

 Ram Dass could only say that he had met Mrs. Dumoise and that she had
      lifted up her veil and given him the message which he had faithfully
      repeated to Dumoise. To this statement Ram Dass adhered.

 He did not know where Nuddea was, had no friends at Nuddea, and would most
      certainly never go to Nuddea; even though his pay were doubled.

 Nuddea is in Bengal, and has nothing whatever to do with a doctor serving
      in the Punjab. It must be more than twelve hundred miles from Meridki.

 Dumoise went through Simla without halting, and returned to Meridki there
      to take over charge from the man who had been officiating for him during
      his tour. There were some Dispensary accounts to be explained, and some
      recent orders of the Surgeon-General to be noted, and, altogether, the
      taking-over was a full day's work. In the evening, Dumoise told his locum
      tenens, who was an old friend of his bachelor days, what had happened at
      Bagi; and the man said that Ram Dass might as well have chosen Tuticorin
      while he was about it.

 At that moment a telegraph-peon came in with a telegram from Simla,
      ordering Dumoise not to take over charge at Meridki, but to go at once to
      Nuddea on special duty. There was a nasty outbreak of cholera at Nuddea,
      and the Bengal Government, being shorthanded, as usual, had borrowed a
      Surgeon from the Punjab.

 Dumoise threw the telegram across the table and said:—“Well?”

 The other Doctor said nothing. It was all that he could say.

 Then he remembered that Dumoise had passed through Simla on his way from
      Bagi; and thus might, possibly, have heard the first news of the impending
      transfer.

 He tried to put the question, and the implied suspicion into words, but
      Dumoise stopped him with:—“If I had desired THAT, I should never
      have come back from Chini. I was shooting there. I wish to live, for I
      have things to do.... but I shall not be sorry.”

 The other man bowed his head, and helped, in the twilight, to pack up
      Dumoise's just opened trunks. Ram Dass entered with the lamps.

 “Where is the Sahib going?” he asked.

 “To Nuddea,” said Dumoise, softly.

 Ram Dass clawed Dumoise's knees and boots and begged him not to go.

 Ram Dass wept and howled till he was turned out of the room. Then he
      wrapped up all his belongings and came back to ask for a character. He was
      not going to Nuddea to see his Sahib die, and, perhaps to die himself.

 So Dumoise gave the man his wages and went down to Nuddea alone; the other
      Doctor bidding him goodbye as one under sentence of death.

 Eleven days later, he had joined his Memsahib; and the Bengal Government
      had to borrow a fresh Doctor to cope with that epidemic at Nuddea. The
      first importation lay dead in Chooadanga Dak-Bungalow.
