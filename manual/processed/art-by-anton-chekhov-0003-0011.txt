ART
    

      A GLOOMY winter morning.
    

On the smooth and
      glittering surface of the river Bystryanka, sprinkled here and there with
      snow, stand two peasants, scrubby little Seryozhka and the church beadle,
      Matvey. Seryozhka, a short-legged, ragged, mangy-looking fellow of thirty,
      stares angrily at the ice. Tufts of wool hang from his shaggy sheepskin
      like a mangy dog. In his hands he holds a compass made of two pointed
      sticks. Matvey, a fine-looking old man in a new sheepskin and high felt
      boots, looks with mild blue eyes upwards where on the high sloping bank a
      village nestles picturesquely. In his hands there is a heavy crowbar.
    

      “Well, are we going to stand like this till evening with our arms
      folded?” says Seryozhka, breaking the silence and turning his angry
      eyes on Matvey. “Have you come here to stand about, old fool, or to
      work?”
    

      “Well, you . . . er . . . show me . . .” Matvey mutters,
      bDlinking mildly.
    

      “Show you. . . . It’s always me: me to show you, and me to do
      it. They have no sense of their own! Mark it out with the compasses, that’s
      what’s wanted! You can’t break the ice without marking it out.
      Mark it! Take the compass.”
    

      Matvey takes the compasses from Seryozhka’s hands, and, shuffling
      heavily on the same spot and jerking with his elbows in all directions, he
      begins awkwardly trying to describe a circle on the ice. Seryozhka screws
      up his eyes contemptuously and obviously enjoys his awkwardness and
      incompetence.
    

      “Eh-eh-eh!” he mutters angrily. “Even that you can’t
      do! The fact is you are a stupid peasant, a wooden-head! You ought to be
      grazing geese and not making a Jordan! Give the compasses here! Give them
      here, I say!”
    

      Seryozhka snatches the compasses out of the hands of the perspiring
      Matvey, and in an instant, jauntily twirling round on one heel, he
      describes a circle on the ice. The outline of the new Jordan is ready now,
      all that is left to do is to break the ice. . .
    

      But before proceeding to the work Seryozhka spends a long time in airs and
      graces, whims and reproaches. . .
    

      “I am not obliged to work for you! You are employed in the church,
      you do it!”
    

      He obviously enjoys the peculiar position in which he has been placed by
      the fate that has bestowed on him the rare talent of surprising the whole
      parish once a year by his art. Poor mild Matvey has to listen to many
      venomous and contemptuous words from him. Seryozhka sets to work with
      vexation, with anger. He is lazy. He has hardly described the circle when
      he is already itching to go up to the village to drink tea, lounge about,
      and babble. . .
    

      “I’ll be back directly,” he says, lighting his
      cigarette, “and meanwhile you had better bring something to sit on
      and sweep up, instead of standing there counting the crows.”
    

      Matvey is left alone. The air is grey and harsh but still. The white
      church peeps out genially from behind the huts scattered on the river
      bank. Jackdaws are incessantly circling round its golden crosses. On one
      side of the village where the river bank breaks off and is steep a hobbled
      horse is standing at the very edge, motionless as a stone, probably asleep
      or deep in thought.
    

      Matvey, too, stands motionless as a statue, waiting patiently. The
      dreamily brooding look of the river, the circling of the jackdaws, and the
      sight of the horse make him drowsy. One hour passes, a second, and still
      Seryozhka does not come. The river has long been swept and a box brought
      to sit on, but the drunken fellow does not appear. Matvey waits and merely
      yawns. The feeling of boredom is one of which he knows nothing. If he were
      told to stand on the river for a day, a month, or a year he would stand
      there.
    

      At last Seryozhka comes into sight from behind the huts. He walks with a
      lurching gait, scarcely moving. He is too lazy to go the long way round,
      and he comes not by the road, but prefers a short cut in a straight line
      down the bank, and sticks in the snow, hangs on to the bushes, slides on
      his back as he comes—and all this slowly, with pauses.
    

      “What are you about?” he cries, falling on Matvey at once.
      “Why are you standing there doing nothing! When are you going to
      break the ice?”
    

      Matvey crosses himself, takes the crowbar in both hands, and begins
      breaking the ice, carefully keeping to the circle that has been drawn.
      Seryozhka sits down on the box and watches the heavy clumsy movements of
      his assistant.
    

      “Easy at the edges! Easy there!” he commands. “If you
      can’t do it properly, you shouldn’t undertake it, once you
      have undertaken it you should do it. You!”
    

      A crowd collects on the top of the bank. At the sight of the spectators
      Seryozhka becomes even more excited.
    

      “I declare I am not going to do it . . .” he says, lighting a
      stinking cigarette and spitting on the ground. “I should like to see
      how you get on without me. Last year at Kostyukovo, Styopka Gulkov
      undertook to make a Jordan as I do. And what did it amount to—it was
      a laughing-stock. The Kostyukovo folks came to ours —crowds and
      crowds of them! The people flocked from all the villages.”
    

      “Because except for ours there is nowhere a proper Jordan . . .”
    

      “Work, there is no time for talking. . . . Yes, old man . . . you
      won’t find another Jordan like it in the whole province. The
      soldiers say you would look in vain, they are not so good even in the
      towns. Easy, easy!”
    

      Matvey puffs and groans. The work is not easy. The ice is firm and thick;
      and he has to break it and at once take the pieces away that the open
      space may not be blocked up.
    

      But, hard as the work is and senseless as Seryozhka’s commands are,
      by three o’clock there is a large circle of dark water in the
      Bystryanka.
    

      “It was better last year,” says Seryozhka angrily. “You
      can’t do even that! Ah, dummy! To keep such fools in the temple of
      God! Go and bring a board to make the pegs! Bring the ring, you crow! And
      er . . . get some bread somewhere . . . and some cucumbers, or something.”
    

      Matvey goes off and soon afterwards comes back, carrying on his shoulders
      an immense wooden ring which had been painted in previous years in
      patterns of various colours. In the centre of the ring is a red cross, at
      the circumference holes for the pegs. Seryozhka takes the ring and covers
      the hole in the ice with it.
    

      “Just right . . . it fits. . . . We have only to renew the paint and
      it will be first-rate. . . . Come, why are you standing still? Make the
      lectern. Or—er—go and get logs to make the cross . . .”
    

      Matvey, who has not tasted food or drink all day, trudges up the hill
      again. Lazy as Seryozhka is, he makes the pegs with his own hands. He
      knows that those pegs have a miraculous power: whoever gets hold of a peg
      after the blessing of the water will be lucky for the whole year. Such
      work is really worth doing.
    

      But the real work begins the following day. Then Seryozhka displays
      himself before the ignorant Matvey in all the greatness of his talent.
      There is no end to his babble, his fault-finding, his whims and fancies.
      If Matvey nails two big pieces of wood to make a cross, he is dissatisfied
      and tells him to do it again. If Matvey stands still, Seryozhka asks him
      angrily why he does not go; if he moves, Seryozhka shouts to him not to go
      away but to do his work. He is not satisfied with his tools, with the
      weather, or with his own talent; nothing pleases him.
    

      Matvey saws out a great piece of ice for a lectern.
    

      “Why have you broken off the corner?” cries Seryozhka, and
      glares at him furiously. “Why have you broken off the corner? I ask
      you.”
    

      “Forgive me, for Christ’s sake.”
    

      “Do it over again!”
    

      Matvey saws again . . . and there is no end to his sufferings. A lectern
      is to stand by the hole in the ice that is covered by the painted ring; on
      the lectern is to be carved the cross and the open gospel. But that is not
      all. Behind the lectern there is to be a high cross to be seen by all the
      crowd and to glitter in the sun as though sprinkled with diamonds and
      rubies. On the cross is to be a dove carved out of ice. The path from the
      church to the Jordan is to be strewn with branches of fir and juniper. All
      this is their task.
    

      First of all Seryozhka sets to work on the lectern. He works with a file,
      a chisel, and an awl. He is perfectly successful in the cross on the
      lectern, the gospel, and the drapery that hangs down from the lectern.
      Then he begins on the dove. While he is trying to carve an expression of
      meekness and humility on the face of the dove, Matvey, lumbering about
      like a bear, is coating with ice the cross he has made of wood. He takes
      the cross and dips it in the hole. Waiting till the water has frozen on
      the cross he dips it in a second time, and so on till the cross is covered
      with a thick layer of ice. It is a difficult job, calling for a great deal
      of strength and patience.
    

      But now the delicate work is finished. Seryozhka races about the village
      like one possessed. He swears and vows he will go at once to the river and
      smash all his work. He is looking for suitable paints.
    

      His pockets are full of ochre, dark blue, red lead, and verdigris; without
      paying a farthing he rushes headlong from one shop to another. The shop is
      next door to the tavern. Here he has a drink; with a wave of his hand he
      darts off without paying. At one hut he gets beetroot leaves, at another
      an onion skin, out of which he makes a yellow colour. He swears, shoves,
      threatens, and not a soul murmurs! They all smile at him, they sympathise
      with him, call him Sergey Nikititch; they all feel that his art is not his
      personal affair but something that concerns them all, the whole people.
      One creates, the others help him. Seryozhka in himself is a nonentity, a
      sluggard, a drunkard, and a wastrel, but when he has his red lead or
      compasses in his hand he is at once something higher, a servant of God.
    

      Epiphany morning comes. The precincts of the church and both banks of the
      river for a long distance are swarming with people. Everything that makes
      up the Jordan is scrupulously concealed under new mats. Seryozhka is
      meekly moving about near the mats, trying to control his emotion. He sees
      thousands of people. There are many here from other parishes; these people
      have come many a mile on foot through the frost and the snow merely to see
      his celebrated Jordan. Matvey, who had finished his coarse, rough work, is
      by now back in the church, there is no sight, no sound of him; he is
      already forgotten . . . . The weather is lovely. . . . There is not a
      cloud in the sky. The sunshine is dazzling.
    

      The church bells ring out on the hill . . . Thousands of heads are bared,
      thousands of hands are moving, there are thousands of signs of the cross!
    

      And Seryozhka does not know what to do with himself for impatience. But
      now they are ringing the bells for the Sacrament; then half an hour later
      a certain agitation is perceptible in the belfry and among the people.
      Banners are borne out of the church one after the other, while the bells
      peal in joyous haste. Seryozhka, trembling, pulls away the mat . . . and
      the people behold something extraordinary. The lectern, the wooden ring,
      the pegs, and the cross in the ice are iridescent with thousands of
      colors. The cross and the dove glitter so dazzlingly that it hurts the
      eyes to look at them. Merciful God, how fine it is! A murmur of wonder and
      delight runs through the crowd; the bells peal more loudly still, the day
      grows brighter; the banners oscillate and move over the crowd as over the
      waves. The procession, glittering with the settings of the ikons and the
      vestments of the clergy, comes slowly down the road and turns towards the
      Jordan. Hands are waved to the belfry for the ringing to cease, and the
      blessing of the water begins. The priests conduct the service slowly,
      deliberately, evidently trying to prolong the ceremony and the joy of
      praying all gathered together. There is perfect stillness.
    

      But now they plunge the cross in, and the air echoes with an extraordinary
      din. Guns are fired, the bells peal furiously, loud exclamations of
      delight, shouts, and a rush to get the pegs. Seryozhka listens to this
      uproar, sees thousands of eyes fixed upon him, and the lazy fellow’s
      soul is filled with a sense of glory and triumph.
