           “Why is my District death-rate low?”
              Said Binks of Hezabad.
           “Well, drains, and sewage-outfalls are
             “My own peculiar fad.

           “I learnt a lesson once, It ran
           “Thus,” quoth that most veracious man:—

   It was an August evening and, in snowy garments clad,
   I paid a round of visits in the lines of Hezabad;
   When, presently, my Waler saw, and did not like at all,
   A Commissariat elephant careering down the Mall.

   I couldn't see the driver, and across my mind it rushed
   That that Commissariat elephant had suddenly gone musth.

   I didn't care to meet him, and I couldn't well get down,
   So I let the Waler have it, and we headed for the town.

   The buggy was a new one and, praise Dykes, it stood the strain,
   Till the Waler jumped a bullock just above the City Drain;
   And the next that I remember was a hurricane of squeals,
   And the creature making toothpicks of my five-foot patent wheels.

   He seemed to want the owner, so I fled, distraught with fear,
   To the Main Drain sewage-outfall while he snorted in my ear—
   Reached the four-foot drain-head safely and, in darkness and despair,
   Felt the brute's proboscis fingering my terror-stiffened hair.

   Heard it trumpet on my shoulder—tried to crawl a little higher—
   Found the Main Drain sewage outfall blocked, some eight feet up, with mire;
   And, for twenty reeking minutes, Sir, my very marrow froze,
   While the trunk was feeling blindly for a purchase on my toes!

   It missed me by a fraction, but my hair was turning grey
   Before they called the drivers up and dragged the brute away.

   Then I sought the City Elders, and my words were very plain.
   They flushed that four-foot drain-head and—it never choked again!

   You may hold with surface-drainage, and the sun-for-garbage cure,
   Till you've been a periwinkle shrinking coyly up a sewer.

   I believe in well-flushed culverts....

                                     This is why the death-rate's small;
   And, if you don't believe me, get shikarred yourself. That's all.
