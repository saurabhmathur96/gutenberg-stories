IN AN HOTEL
    

“LET me tell
      you, my good man,” began Madame Nashatyrin, the colonel’s lady
      at No. 47, crimson and spluttering, as she pounced on the hotel-keeper.
      “Either give me other apartments, or I shall leave your confounded
      hotel altogether! It’s a sink of iniquity! Mercy on us, I have
      grown-up daughters and one hears nothing but abominations day and night!
      It’s beyond everything! Day and night! Sometimes he fires off such
      things that it simply makes one’s ears blush! Positively like a
      cabman. It’s a good thing that my poor girls don’t understand
      or I should have to fly out into the street with them. . . He’s
      saying something now! You listen!”
    

      “I know a thing better than that, my boy,” a husky bass
      floated in from the next room. “Do you remember Lieutenant Druzhkov?
      Well, that same Druzhkov was one day making a drive with the yellow into
      the pocket and as he usually did, you know, flung up his leg. . . . All at
      once something went crrr-ack! At first they thought he had torn the cloth
      of the billiard table, but when they looked, my dear fellow, his United
      States had split at every seam! He had made such a high kick, the beast,
      that not a seam was left. . . . Ha-ha-ha, and there were ladies present,
      too . . . among others the wife of that drivelling Lieutenant Okurin. . .
      . Okurin was furious. . . . ‘How dare the fellow,’ said he,
      ‘behave with impropriety in the presence of my wife?’ One
      thing led to another . . . you know our fellows! . . . Okurin sent seconds
      to Druzhkov, and Druzhkov said ‘don’t be a fool’ . . .
      ha-ha-ha, ‘but tell him he had better send seconds not to me but to
      the tailor who made me those breeches; it is his fault, you know.’
      Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha. . . .”
    

      Lilya and Mila, the colonel’s daughters, who were sitting in the
      window with their round cheeks propped on their fists, flushed crimson and
      dropped their eyes that looked buried in their plump faces.
    

      “Now you have heard him, haven’t you?” Madame Nashatyrin
      went on, addressing the hotel-keeper. “And that, you consider, of no
      consequence, I suppose? I am the wife of a colonel, sir! My husband is a
      commanding officer. I will not permit some cabman to utter such infamies
      almost in my presence!”
    

      “He is not a cabman, madam, but the staff-captain Kikin. . . . A
      gentleman born.”
    

      “If he has so far forgotten his station as to express himself like a
      cabman, then he is even more deserving of contempt! In short, don’t
      answer me, but kindly take steps!”
    

      “But what can I do, madam? You are not the only one to complain,
      everybody’s complaining, but what am I to do with him? One goes to
      his room and begins putting him to shame, saying: ‘Hannibal
      Ivanitch, have some fear of God! It’s shameful! and he’ll
      punch you in the face with his fists and say all sorts of things: ‘there,
      put that in your pipe and smoke it,’ and such like. It’s a
      disgrace! He wakes up in the morning and sets to walking about the
      corridor in nothing, saving your presence, but his underclothes. And when
      he has had a drop he will pick up a revolver and set to putting bullets
      into the wall. By day he is swilling liquor and at night he plays cards
      like mad, and after cards it is fighting. . . . I am ashamed for the other
      lodgers to see it!”
    

      “Why don’t you get rid of the scoundrel?”
    

      “Why, there’s no getting him out! He owes me for three months,
      but we don’t ask for our money, we simply ask him to get out as a
      favour . . . . The magistrate has given him an order to clear out of the
      rooms, but he’s taking it from one court to another, and so it drags
      on. . . . He’s a perfect nuisance, that’s what he is. And,
      good Lord, such a man, too! Young, good-looking and intellectual. . . .
      When he hasn’t had a drop you couldn’t wish to see a nicer
      gentleman. The other day he wasn’t drunk and he spent the whole day
      writing letters to his father and mother.”
    

      “Poor father and mother!” sighed the colonel’s lady.
    

      “They are to be pitied, to be sure! There’s no comfort in
      having such a scamp! He’s sworn at and turned out of his lodgings,
      and not a day passes but he is in trouble over some scandal. It’s
      sad!”
    

      “His poor unhappy wife!” sighed the lady.
    

      “He has no wife, madam. A likely idea! She would have to thank God
      if her head were not broken. . . .”
    

      The lady walked up and down the room.
    

      “He is not married, you say?”
    

      “Certainly not, madam.”
    

      The lady walked up and down the room again and mused a little.
    

      “H’m, not married . . .” she pronounced meditatively.
      “H’m. Lilya and Mila, don’t sit at the window, there’s
      a draught! What a pity! A young man and to let himself sink to this! And
      all owing to what? The lack of good influence! There is no mother who
      would. . . . Not married? Well . . . there it is. . . . Please be so good,”
      the lady continued suavely after a moment’s thought, “as to go
      to him and ask him in my name to . . . refrain from using expressions. . .
      . Tell him that Madame Nashatyrin begs him. . . . Tell him she is staying
      with her daughters in No. 47 . . . that she has come up from her estate in
      the country. . . .”
    

      “Certainly.”
    

      “Tell him, a colonel’s lady and her daughters. He might even
      come and apologize. . . . We are always at home after dinner. Oh, Mila,
      shut the window!”
    

      “Why, what do you want with that . . . black sheep, mamma?”
      drawled Lilya when the hotel-keeper had retired. “A queer person to
      invite! A drunken, rowdy rascal!”
    

      “Oh, don’t say so, ma chÃ¨re! You always talk like that; and
      there . . . sit down! Why, whatever he may be, we ought not to despise
      him. . . . There’s something good in everyone. Who knows,”
      sighed the colonel’s lady, looking her daughters up and down
      anxiously, “perhaps your fate is here. Change your dresses anyway. .
      . .”
    











      IN A STRANGE LAND
    

SUNDAY, midday. A
      landowner, called Kamyshev, is sitting in his dining-room, deliberately
      eating his lunch at a luxuriously furnished table. Monsieur Champoun, a
      clean, neat, smoothly-shaven, old Frenchman, is sharing the meal with him.
      This Champoun had once been a tutor in Kamyshev’s household, had
      taught his children good manners, the correct pronunciation of French, and
      dancing: afterwards when Kamyshev’s children had grown up and become
      lieutenants, Champoun had become something like a bonne of the male
      sex. The duties of the former tutor were not complicated. He had to be
      properly dressed, to smell of scent, to listen to Kamyshev’s idle
      babble, to eat and drink and sleep—and apparently that was all. For
      this he received a room, his board, and an indefinite salary.
    

      Kamyshev eats and as usual babbles at random.
    

      “Damnation!” he says, wiping away the tears that have come
      into his eyes after a mouthful of ham thickly smeared with mustard.
      “Ough! It has shot into my head and all my joints. Your French
      mustard would not do that, you know, if you ate the whole potful.”
    

      “Some like the French, some prefer the Russian. . .” Champoun
      assents mildly.
    

      “No one likes French mustard except Frenchmen. And a Frenchman will
      eat anything, whatever you give him—frogs and rats and black
      beetles. . . brrr! You don’t like that ham, for instance, because it
      is Russian, but if one were to give you a bit of baked glass and tell you
      it was French, you would eat it and smack your lips. . . . To your
      thinking everything Russian is nasty.”
    

      “I don’t say that.”
    

      “Everything Russian is nasty, but if it’s French—o say
      tray zholee! To your thinking there is no country better than France, but
      to my mind. . . Why, what is France, to tell the truth about it? A little
      bit of land. Our police captain was sent out there, but in a month he
      asked to be transferred: there was nowhere to turn round! One can drive
      round the whole of your France in one day, while here when you drive out
      of the gate—you can see no end to the land, you can ride on and on.
      . .”
    

      “Yes, monsieur, Russia is an immense country.”
    

      “To be sure it is! To your thinking there are no better people than
      the French. Well-educated, clever people! Civilization! I agree, the
      French are all well-educated with elegant manners. . . that is true. . . .
      A Frenchman never allows himself to be rude: he hands a lady a chair at
      the right minute, he doesn’t eat crayfish with his fork, he doesn’t
      spit on the floor, but . . . there’s not the same spirit in him! not
      the spirit in him! I don’t know how to explain it to you but,
      however one is to express it, there’s nothing in a Frenchman of . .
      . something . . . (the speaker flourishes his fingers) . . . of something
      . . . fanatical. I remember I have read somewhere that all of you have
      intelligence acquired from books, while we Russians have innate
      intelligence. If a Russian studies the sciences properly, none of your
      French professors is a match for him.”
    

      “Perhaps,” says Champoun, as it were reluctantly.
    

      “No, not perhaps, but certainly! It’s no use your frowning, it’s
      the truth I am speaking. The Russian intelligence is an inventive
      intelligence. Only of course he is not given a free outlet for it, and he
      is no hand at boasting. He will invent something—and break it or
      give it to the children to play with, while your Frenchman will invent
      some nonsensical thing and make an uproar for all the world to hear it.
      The other day Iona the coachman carved a little man out of wood, if you
      pull the little man by a thread he plays unseemly antics. But Iona does
      not brag of it. . . . I don’t like Frenchmen as a rule. I am not
      referring to you, but speaking generally. . . . They are an immoral
      people! Outwardly they look like men, but they live like dogs. Take
      marriage for instance. With us, once you are married, you stick to your
      wife, and there is no talk about it, but goodness knows how it is with
      you. The husband is sitting all day long in a cafÃ©, while his wife fills
      the house with Frenchmen, and sets to dancing the can-can with them.”
    

      “That’s not true!” Champoun protests, flaring up and
      unable to restrain himself. “The principle of the family is highly
      esteemed in France.”
    

      “We know all about that principle! You ought to be ashamed to defend
      it: one ought to be impartial: a pig is always a pig. . . . We must thank
      the Germans for having beaten them. . . . Yes indeed, God bless them for
      it.”
    

      “In that case, monsieur, I don’t understand. . .” says
      the Frenchman leaping up with flashing eyes, “if you hate the French
      why do you keep me?”
    

      “What am I to do with you?”
    

      “Let me go, and I will go back to France.”
    

      “Wha-at? But do you suppose they would let you into France now? Why,
      you are a traitor to your country! At one time Napoleon’s your great
      man, at another Gambetta. . . . Who the devil can make you out?”
    

      “Monsieur,” says Champoun in French, spluttering and crushing
      up his table napkin in his hands, “my worst enemy could not have
      thought of a greater insult than the outrage you have just done to my
      feelings! All is over!”
    

      And with a tragic wave of his arm the Frenchman flings his dinner napkin
      on the table majestically, and walks out of the room with dignity.
    

      Three hours later the table is laid again, and the servants bring in the
      dinner. Kamyshev sits alone at the table. After the preliminary glass he
      feels a craving to babble. He wants to chatter, but he has no listener.
    

      “What is Alphonse Ludovikovitch doing?” he asks the footman.
    

      “He is packing his trunk, sir.”
    

      “What a noodle! Lord forgive us!” says Kamyshev, and goes in
      to the Frenchman.
    

      Champoun is sitting on the floor in his room, and with trembling hands is
      packing in his trunk his linen, scent bottles, prayer-books, braces, ties.
      . . . All his correct figure, his trunk, his bedstead and the table—all
      have an air of elegance and effeminacy. Great tears are dropping from his
      big blue eyes into the trunk.
    

      “Where are you off to?” asks Kamyshev, after standing still
      for a little.
    

      The Frenchman says nothing.
    

      “Do you want to go away?” Kamyshev goes on. “Well, you
      know, but . . . I won’t venture to detain you. But what is queer is,
      how are you going to travel without a passport? I wonder! You know I have
      lost your passport. I thrust it in somewhere between some papers, and it
      is lost. . . . And they are strict about passports among us. Before you
      have gone three or four miles they pounce upon you.”
    

      Champoun raises his head and looks mistrustfully at Kamyshev.
    

      “Yes. . . . You will see! They will see from your face you haven’t
      a passport, and ask at once: Who is that? Alphonse Champoun. We know that
      Alphonse Champoun. Wouldn’t you like to go under police escort
      somewhere nearer home!”
    

      “Are you joking?”
    

      “What motive have I for joking? Why should I? Only mind now; it’s
      a compact, don’t you begin whining then and writing letters. I won’t
      stir a finger when they lead you by in fetters!”
    

      Champoun jumps up and, pale and wide-eyed, begins pacing up and down the
      room.
    

      “What are you doing to me?” he says in despair, clutching at
      his head. “My God! accursed be that hour when the fatal thought of
      leaving my country entered my head! . . .”
    

      “Come, come, come . . . I was joking!” says Kamyshev in a
      lower tone. “Queer fish he is; he doesn’t understand a joke.
      One can’t say a word!”
    

      “My dear friend!” shrieks Champoun, reassured by Kamyshev’s
      tone. “I swear I am devoted to Russia, to you and your children. . .
      . To leave you is as bitter to me as death itself! But every word you
      utter stabs me to the heart!”
    

      “Ah, you queer fish! If I do abuse the French, what reason have you
      to take offence? You are a queer fish really! You should follow the
      example of Lazar Isaakitch, my tenant. I call him one thing and another, a
      Jew, and a scurvy rascal, and I make a pig’s ear out of my coat
      tail, and catch him by his Jewish curls. He doesn’t take offence.”
    

      “But he is a slave! For a kopeck he is ready to put up with any
      insult!”
    

      “Come, come, come . . . that’s enough! Peace and concord!”
    

      Champoun powders his tear-stained face and goes with Kamyshev to the
      dining-room. The first course is eaten in silence, after the second the
      same performance begins over again, and so Champoun’s sufferings
      have no end.
