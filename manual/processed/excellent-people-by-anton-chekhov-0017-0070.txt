EXCELLENT PEOPLE

  O

NCE upon a time
      there lived in Moscow a man called Vladimir Semyonitch Liadovsky. He took
      his degree at the university in the faculty of law and had a post on the
      board of management of some railway; but if you had asked him what his
      work was, he would look candidly and openly at you with his large bright
      eyes through his gold pincenez, and would answer in a soft, velvety,
      lisping baritone:

 “My work is literature.”

 After completing his course at the university, Vladimir Semyonitch had had
      a paragraph of theatrical criticism accepted by a newspaper. From this
      paragraph he passed on to reviewing, and a year later he had advanced to
      writing a weekly article on literary matters for the same paper. But it
      does not follow from these facts that he was an amateur, that his literary
      work was of an ephemeral, haphazard character. Whenever I saw his neat
      spare figure, his high forehead and long mane of hair, when I listened to
      his speeches, it always seemed to me that his writing, quite apart from
      what and how he wrote, was something organically part of him, like the
      beating of his heart, and that his whole literary programme must have been
      an integral part of his brain while he was a baby in his mother’s
      womb. Even in his walk, his gestures, his manner of shaking off the ash
      from his cigarette, I could read this whole programme from A to Z, with
      all its claptrap, dulness, and honourable sentiments. He was a literary
      man all over when with an inspired face he laid a wreath on the coffin of
      some celebrity, or with a grave and solemn face collected signatures for
      some address; his passion for making the acquaintance of distinguished
      literary men, his faculty for finding talent even where it was absent, his
      perpetual enthusiasm, his pulse that went at one hundred and twenty a
      minute, his ignorance of life, the genuinely feminine flutter with which
      he threw himself into concerts and literary evenings for the benefit of
      destitute students, the way in which he gravitated towards the young—all
      this would have created for him the reputation of a writer even if he had
      not written his articles.

 He was one of those writers to whom phrases like, “We are but few,”
      or “What would life be without strife? Forward!” were
      pre-eminently becoming, though he never strove with any one and never did
      go forward. It did not even sound mawkish when he fell to discoursing of
      ideals. Every anniversary of the university, on St. Tatiana’s Day,
      he got drunk, chanted Gaudeamus out of tune, and his beaming and
      perspiring countenance seemed to say: “See, I’m drunk; I’m
      keeping it up!” But even that suited him.

 Vladimir Semyonitch had genuine faith in his literary vocation and his
      whole programme. He had no doubts, and was evidently very well pleased
      with himself. Only one thing grieved him—the paper for which he
      worked had a limited circulation and was not very influential. But
      Vladimir Semyonitch believed that sooner or later he would succeed in
      getting on to a solid magazine where he would have scope and could display
      himself—and what little distress he felt on this score was pale
      beside the brilliance of his hopes.

 Visiting this charming man, I made the acquaintance of his sister, Vera
      Semyonovna, a woman doctor. At first sight, what struck me about this
      woman was her look of exhaustion and extreme ill-health. She was young,
      with a good figure and regular, rather large features, but in comparison
      with her agile, elegant, and talkative brother she seemed angular,
      listless, slovenly, and sullen. There was something strained, cold,
      apathetic in her movements, smiles, and words; she was not liked, and was
      thought proud and not very intelligent.

 In reality, I fancy, she was resting.

 “My dear friend,” her brother would often say to me, sighing
      and flinging back his hair in his picturesque literary way, “one
      must never judge by appearances! Look at this book: it has long ago been
      read. It is warped, tattered, and lies in the dust uncared for; but open
      it, and it will make you weep and turn pale. My sister is like that book.
      Lift the cover and peep into her soul, and you will be horror-stricken.
      Vera passed in some three months through experiences that would have been
      ample for a whole lifetime!”

 Vladimir Semyonitch looked round him, took me by the sleeve, and began to
      whisper:

 “You know, after taking her degree she married, for love, an
      architect. It’s a complete tragedy! They had hardly been married a
      month when—whew—her husband died of typhus. But that was not
      all. She caught typhus from him, and when, on her recovery, she learnt
      that her Ivan was dead, she took a good dose of morphia. If it had not
      been for vigorous measures taken by her friends, my Vera would have been
      by now in Paradise. Tell me, isn’t it a tragedy? And is not my
      sister like an ingénue , who has played already all the five acts of
      her life? The audience may stay for the farce, but the ingénue must
      go home to rest.”

 After three months of misery Vera Semyonovna had come to live with her
      brother. She was not fitted for the practice of medicine, which exhausted
      her and did not satisfy her; she did not give one the impression of
      knowing her subject, and I never once heard her say anything referring to
      her medical studies.

 She gave up medicine, and, silent and unoccupied, as though she were a
      prisoner, spent the remainder of her youth in colourless apathy, with
      bowed head and hanging hands. The only thing to which she was not
      completely indifferent, and which brought some brightness into the
      twilight of her life, was the presence of her brother, whom she loved. She
      loved him himself and his programme, she was full of reverence for his
      articles; and when she was asked what her brother was doing, she would
      answer in a subdued voice as though afraid of waking or distracting him:
      “He is writing. . . .” Usually when he was at his work she
      used to sit beside him, her eyes fixed on his writing hand. She used at
      such moments to look like a sick animal warming itself in the sun. . . .

 One winter evening Vladimir Semyonitch was sitting at his table writing a
      critical article for his newspaper: Vera Semyonovna was sitting beside
      him, staring as usual at his writing hand. The critic wrote rapidly,
      without erasures or corrections. The pen scratched and squeaked. On the
      table near the writing hand there lay open a freshly-cut volume of a thick
      magazine, containing a story of peasant life, signed with two initials.
      Vladimir Semyonitch was enthusiastic; he thought the author was admirable
      in his handling of the subject, suggested Turgenev in his descriptions of
      nature, was truthful, and had an excellent knowledge of the life of the
      peasantry. The critic himself knew nothing of peasant life except from
      books and hearsay, but his feelings and his inner convictions forced him
      to believe the story. He foretold a brilliant future for the author,
      assured him he should await the conclusion of the story with great
      impatience, and so on.

 “Fine story!” he said, flinging himself back in his chair and
      closing his eyes with pleasure. “The tone is extremely good.”

 Vera Semyonovna looked at him, yawned aloud, and suddenly asked an
      unexpected question. In the evening she had a habit of yawning nervously
      and asking short, abrupt questions, not always relevant.

 “Volodya,” she asked, “what is the meaning of
      non-resistance to evil?”

 “Non-resistance to evil!” repeated her brother, opening his
      eyes.

 “Yes. What do you understand by it?”

 “You see, my dear, imagine that thieves or brigands attack you, and
      you, instead of . . .”

 “No, give me a logical definition.”

 “A logical definition? Um! Well.” Vladimir Semyonitch
      pondered. “Non-resistance to evil means an attitude of
      non-interference with regard to all that in the sphere of mortality is
      called evil.”

 Saying this, Vladimir Semyonitch bent over the table and took up a novel.
      This novel, written by a woman, dealt with the painfulness of the
      irregular position of a society lady who was living under the same roof
      with her lover and her illegitimate child. Vladimir Semyonitch was pleased
      with the excellent tendency of the story, the plot and the presentation of
      it. Making a brief summary of the novel, he selected the best passages and
      added to them in his account: “How true to reality, how living, how
      picturesque! The author is not merely an artist; he is also a subtle
      psychologist who can see into the hearts of his characters. Take, for
      example, this vivid description of the emotions of the heroine on meeting
      her husband,” and so on.

 “Volodya,” Vera Semyonovna interrupted his critical effusions,
      “I’ve been haunted by a strange idea since yesterday. I keep
      wondering where we should all be if human life were ordered on the basis
      of non-resistance to evil?”

 “In all probability, nowhere. Non-resistance to evil would give the
      full rein to the criminal will, and, to say nothing of civilisation, this
      would leave not one stone standing upon another anywhere on earth.”

 “What would be left?”

 “Bashi-Bazouke and brothels. In my next article I’ll talk
      about that perhaps. Thank you for reminding me.”

 And a week later my friend kept his promise. That was just at the period—in
      the eighties—when people were beginning to talk and write of
      non-resistance, of the right to judge, to punish, to make war; when some
      people in our set were beginning to do without servants, to retire into
      the country, to work on the land, and to renounce animal food and carnal
      love.

 After reading her brother’s article, Vera Semyonovna pondered and
      hardly perceptibly shrugged her shoulders.

 “Very nice!” she said. “But still there’s a great
      deal I don’t understand. For instance, in Leskov’s story
      ‘Belonging to the Cathedral’ there is a queer gardener who
      sows for the benefit of all—for customers, for beggars, and any who
      care to steal. Did he behave sensibly?”

 From his sister’s tone and expression Vladimir Semyonitch saw that
      she did not like his article, and, almost for the first time in his life,
      his vanity as an author sustained a shock. With a shade of irritation he
      answered:

 “Theft is immoral. To sow for thieves is to recognise the right of
      thieves to existence. What would you think if I were to establish a
      newspaper and, dividing it into sections, provide for blackmailing as well
      as for liberal ideas? Following the example of that gardener, I ought,
      logically, to provide a section for blackmailers, the intellectual
      scoundrels? Yes.”

 Vera Semyonovna made no answer. She got up from the table, moved languidly
      to the sofa and lay down.

 “I don’t know, I know nothing about it,” she said
      musingly. “You are probably right, but it seems to me, I feel
      somehow, that there’s something false in our resistance to evil, as
      though there were something concealed or unsaid. God knows, perhaps our
      methods of resisting evil belong to the category of prejudices which have
      become so deeply rooted in us, that we are incapable of parting with them,
      and therefore cannot form a correct judgment of them.”

 “How do you mean?”

 “I don’t know how to explain to you. Perhaps man is mistaken
      in thinking that he is obliged to resist evil and has a right to do so,
      just as he is mistaken in thinking, for instance, that the heart looks
      like an ace of hearts. It is very possible in resisting evil we ought not
      to use force, but to use what is the very opposite of force—if you,
      for instance, don’t want this picture stolen from you, you ought to
      give it away rather than lock it up. . . .”

 “That’s clever, very clever! If I want to marry a rich, vulgar
      woman, she ought to prevent me from such a shabby action by hastening to
      make me an offer herself!”

 The brother and sister talked till midnight without understanding each
      other. If any outsider had overheard them he would hardly have been able
      to make out what either of them was driving at.

 They usually spent the evening at home. There were no friends’
      houses to which they could go, and they felt no need for friends; they
      only went to the theatre when there was a new play—such was the
      custom in literary circles—they did not go to concerts, for they did
      not care for music.

 “You may think what you like,” Vera Semyonovna began again the
      next day, “but for me the question is to a great extent settled. I
      am firmly convinced that I have no grounds for resisting evil directed
      against me personally. If they want to kill me, let them. My defending
      myself will not make the murderer better. All I have now to decide is the
      second half of the question: how I ought to behave to evil directed
      against my neighbours?”

 “Vera, mind you don’t become rabid!” said Vladimir
      Semyonitch, laughing. “I see non-resistance is becoming your idée
      fixe !”

 He wanted to turn off these tedious conversations with a jest, but somehow
      it was beyond a jest; his smile was artificial and sour. His sister gave
      up sitting beside his table and gazing reverently at his writing hand, and
      he felt every evening that behind him on the sofa lay a person who did not
      agree with him. And his back grew stiff and numb, and there was a chill in
      his soul. An author’s vanity is vindictive, implacable, incapable of
      forgiveness, and his sister was the first and only person who had laid
      bare and disturbed that uneasy feeling, which is like a big box of
      crockery, easy to unpack but impossible to pack up again as it was before.

 Weeks and months passed by, and his sister clung to her ideas, and did not
      sit down by the table. One spring evening Vladimir Semyonitch was sitting
      at his table writing an article. He was reviewing a novel which described
      how a village schoolmistress refused the man whom she loved and who loved
      her, a man both wealthy and intellectual, simply because marriage made her
      work as a schoolmistress impossible. Vera Semyonovna lay on the sofa and
      brooded.

 “My God, how slow it is!” she said, stretching. “How
      insipid and empty life is! I don’t know what to do with myself, and
      you are wasting your best years in goodness knows what. Like some
      alchemist, you are rummaging in old rubbish that nobody wants. My God!”

 Vladimir Semyonitch dropped his pen and slowly looked round at his sister.

 “It’s depressing to look at you!” said his sister.
      “Wagner in ‘Faust’ dug up worms, but he was looking for
      a treasure, anyway, and you are looking for worms for the sake of the
      worms.”

 “That’s vague!”

 “Yes, Volodya; all these days I’ve been thinking, I’ve
      been thinking painfully for a long time, and I have come to the conclusion
      that you are hopelessly reactionary and conventional. Come, ask yourself
      what is the object of your zealous, conscientious work? Tell me, what is
      it? Why, everything has long ago been extracted that can be extracted from
      that rubbish in which you are always rummaging. You may pound water in a
      mortar and analyse it as long as you like, you’ll make nothing more
      of it than the chemists have made already. . . .”

 “Indeed!” drawled Vladimir Semyonitch, getting up. “Yes,
      all this is old rubbish because these ideas are eternal; but what do you
      consider new, then?”

 “You undertake to work in the domain of thought; it is for you to
      think of something new. It’s not for me to teach you.”

 “Me—an alchemist!” the critic cried in wonder and
      indignation, screwing up his eyes ironically. “Art, progress—all
      that is alchemy?”

 “You see, Volodya, it seems to me that if all you thinking people
      had set yourselves to solving great problems, all these little questions
      that you fuss about now would solve themselves by the way. If you go up in
      a balloon to see a town, you will incidentally, without any effort, see
      the fields and the villages and the rivers as well. When stearine is
      manufactured, you get glycerine as a by-product. It seems to me that
      contemporary thought has settled on one spot and stuck to it. It is
      prejudiced, apathetic, timid, afraid to take a wide titanic flight, just
      as you and I are afraid to climb on a high mountain; it is conservative.”

 Such conversations could not but leave traces. The relations of the
      brother and sister grew more and more strained every day. The brother
      became unable to work in his sister’s presence, and grew irritable
      when he knew his sister was lying on the sofa, looking at his back; while
      the sister frowned nervously and stretched when, trying to bring back the
      past, he attempted to share his enthusiasms with her. Every evening she
      complained of being bored, and talked about independence of mind and those
      who are in the rut of tradition. Carried away by her new ideas, Vera
      Semyonovna proved that the work that her brother was so engrossed in was
      conventional, that it was a vain effort of conservative minds to preserve
      what had already served its turn and was vanishing from the scene of
      action. She made no end of comparisons. She compared her brother at one
      time to an alchemist, then to a musty old Believer who would sooner die
      than listen to reason. By degrees there was a perceptible change in her
      manner of life, too. She was capable of lying on the sofa all day long
      doing nothing but think, while her face wore a cold, dry expression such
      as one sees in one-sided people of strong faith. She began to refuse the
      attentions of the servants, swept and tidied her own room, cleaned her own
      boots and brushed her own clothes. Her brother could not help looking with
      irritation and even hatred at her cold face when she went about her menial
      work. In that work, which was always performed with a certain solemnity,
      he saw something strained and false, he saw something both pharisaical and
      affected. And knowing he could not touch her by persuasion, he carped at
      her and teased her like a schoolboy.

 “You won’t resist evil, but you resist my having servants!”
      he taunted her. “If servants are an evil, why do you oppose it? That’s
      inconsistent!”

 He suffered, was indignant and even ashamed. He felt ashamed when his
      sister began doing odd things before strangers.

 “It’s awful, my dear fellow,” he said to me in private,
      waving his hands in despair. “It seems that our ingénue has
      remained to play a part in the farce, too. She’s become morbid to
      the marrow of her bones! I’ve washed my hands of her, let her think
      as she likes; but why does she talk, why does she excite me? She ought to
      think what it means for me to listen to her. What I feel when in my
      presence she has the effrontery to support her errors by blasphemously
      quoting the teaching of Christ! It chokes me! It makes me hot all over to
      hear my sister propounding her doctrines and trying to distort the Gospel
      to suit her, when she purposely refrains from mentioning how the
      moneychangers were driven out of the Temple. That’s, my dear fellow,
      what comes of being half educated, undeveloped! That’s what comes of
      medical studies which provide no general culture!”

 One day on coming home from the office, Vladimir Semyonitch found his
      sister crying. She was sitting on the sofa with her head bowed, wringing
      her hands, and tears were flowing freely down her cheeks. The critic’s
      good heart throbbed with pain. Tears fell from his eyes, too, and he
      longed to pet his sister, to forgive her, to beg her forgiveness, and to
      live as they used to before. . . . He knelt down and kissed her head, her
      hands, her shoulders. . . . She smiled, smiled bitterly, unaccountably,
      while he with a cry of joy jumped up, seized the magazine from the table
      and said warmly:

 “Hurrah! We’ll live as we used to, Verotchka! With God’s
      blessing! And I’ve such a surprise for you here! Instead of
      celebrating the occasion with champagne, let us read it together! A
      splendid, wonderful thing!”

 “Oh, no, no!” cried Vera Semyonovna, pushing away the book in
      alarm. “I’ve read it already! I don’t want it, I don’t
      want it!”

 “When did you read it?”

 “A year . . . two years ago. . . I read it long ago, and I know it,
      I know it!”

 “H’m! . . . You’re a fanatic!” her brother said
      coldly, flinging the magazine on to the table.

 “No, you are a fanatic, not I! You!” And Vera Semyonovna
      dissolved into tears again. Her brother stood before her, looked at her
      quivering shoulders, and thought. He thought, not of the agonies of
      loneliness endured by any one who begins to think in a new way of their
      own, not of the inevitable sufferings of a genuine spiritual revolution,
      but of the outrage of his programme, the outrage to his author’s
      vanity.

 From this time he treated his sister coldly, with careless irony, and he
      endured her presence in the room as one endures the presence of old women
      that are dependent on one. For her part, she left off disputing with him
      and met all his arguments, jeers, and attacks with a condescending silence
      which irritated him more than ever.

 One summer morning Vera Semyonovna, dressed for travelling with a satchel
      over her shoulder, went in to her brother and coldly kissed him on the
      forehead.

 “Where are you going?” he asked with surprise.

 “To the province of N. to do vaccination work.” Her brother
      went out into the street with her.

 “So that’s what you’ve decided upon, you queer girl,”
      he muttered. “Don’t you want some money?”

 “No, thank you. Good-bye.”

 The sister shook her brother’s hand and set off.

 “Why don’t you have a cab?” cried Vladimir Semyonitch.

 She did not answer. Her brother gazed after her, watched her rusty-looking
      waterproof, the swaying of her figure as she slouched along, forced
      himself to sigh, but did not succeed in rousing a feeling of regret. His
      sister had become a stranger to him. And he was a stranger to her. Anyway,
      she did not once look round.

 Going back to his room, Vladimir Semyonitch at once sat down to the table
      and began to work at his article.

 I never saw Vera Semyonovna again. Where she is now I do not know. And
      Vladimir Semyonitch went on writing his articles, laying wreaths on
      coffins, singing Gaudeamus , busying himself over the Mutual Aid
      Society of Moscow Journalists.

 He fell ill with inflammation of the lungs; he was ill in bed for three
      months—at first at home, and afterwards in the Golitsyn Hospital. An
      abscess developed in his knee. People said he ought to be sent to the
      Crimea, and began getting up a collection for him. But he did not go to
      the Crimea—he died. We buried him in the Vagankovsky Cemetery, on
      the left side, where artists and literary men are buried.

 One day we writers were sitting in the Tatars’ restaurant. I
      mentioned that I had lately been in the Vagankovsky Cemetery and had seen
      Vladimir Semyonitch’s grave there. It was utterly neglected and
      almost indistinguishable from the rest of the ground, the cross had
      fallen; it was necessary to collect a few roubles to put it in order.

 But they listened to what I said unconcernedly, made no answer, and I
      could not collect a farthing. No one remembered Vladimir Semyonitch. He
      was utterly forgotten.
