Nicolai Ilyich Byelyaev, a Petersburg landlord, very fond of the
      racecourse, a well fed, pink young man of about thirty-two, once called
      towards evening on Madame Irnin—Olga Ivanovna—with whom he had
      a liaison, or, to use his own phrase, spun out a long and tedious
      romance. And indeed the first pages of this romance, pages of interest and
      inspiration, had been read long ago; now they dragged on and on, and
      presented neither novelty nor interest.
    

      Finding that Olga Ivanovna was not at home, my hero lay down a moment on
      the drawing-room sofa and began to wait.
    

      "Good evening, Nicolai Ilyich," he suddenly heard a child's voice say.
      "Mother will be in in a moment. She's gone to the dressmaker's with
      Sonya."
    

      In the same drawing-room on the sofa lay Olga Vassilievna's son, Alyosha,
      a boy about eight years old, well built, well looked after, dressed up
      like a picture in a velvet jacket and long black stockings. He lay on a
      satin pillow, and apparently imitating an acrobat whom he had lately seen
      in the circus, lifted up first one leg then the other. When his elegant
      legs began to be tired, he moved his hands, or he jumped up impetuously
      and then went on all fours, trying to stand with his legs in the air. All
      this he did with a most serious face, breathing heavily, as if he himself
      found no happiness in God's gift of such a restless body.
    

      "Ah, how do you do, my friend?" said Byelyaev. "Is it you? I didn't notice
      you. Is your mother well?"
    

      At the moment Alyosha had just taken hold of the toe of his left foot in
      his right hand and got into a most awkward pose. He turned head over
      heels, jumped up, and glanced from under the big, fluffy lampshade at
      Byelyaev.
    

      "How can I put it?" he said, shrugging his shoulders. "As a matter of
      plain fact mother is never well. You see she's a woman, and women, Nicolai
      Ilyich, have always some pain or another."
    

      For something to do, Byelyaev began to examine Alyosha's face. All the
      time he had been acquainted with Olga Ivanovna he had never once turned
      his attention to the boy and had completely ignored his existence. A boy
      is stuck in front of your eyes, but what is he doing here, what is his rÃ´le?—you
      don't want to give a single thought to the question.
    

      In the evening dusk Alyosha's face with a pale forehead and steady black
      eyes unexpectedly reminded Byelyaev of Olga Vassilievna as she was in the
      first pages of the romance. He had the desire to be affectionate to the
      boy.
    

      "Come here, whipper-snapper," he said. "Come and let me have a good look
      at you, quite close."
    

      The boy jumped off the sofa and ran to Byelyaev.
    

      "Well?" Nicolai Ilyich began, putting his hand on the thin shoulders. "And
      how are things with you?"
    

      "How shall I put it?... They used to be much better before."
    

      "How?"
    

      "Quite simple. Before, Sonya and I only had to do music and reading, and
      now we're given French verses to learn. You've had your hair cut lately?"
    

      "Yes, just lately."
    

      "That's why I noticed it. Your beard's shorter. May I touch it ... doesn't
      it hurt?"
    

      "No, not a bit."
    

      "Why is it that it hurts if you pull one hair, and when you pull a whole
      lot, it doesn't hurt a bit? Ah, ah I You know it's a pity you don't have
      side-whiskers. You should shave here, and at the sides ... and leave the
      hair just here."
    

      The boy pressed close to Byelyaev and began to play with his watch-chain.
    

      "When I go to the gymnasium," he said, "Mother is going to buy me a watch.
      I'll ask her to buy me a chain just like this. What a fine locket I Father
      has one just the same, but yours has stripes, here, and his has got
      letters.... Inside it's mother's picture. Father has another chain now,
      not in links, but like a ribbon...."
    

      "How do you know? Do you see your father?"
    

      "I? Mm ... no ... I ..."
    

      Alyosha blushed and in the violent confusion of being detected in a lie
      began to scratch the locket busily with his finger-nail. Byelyaev looked
      steadily at his face and asked:
    

      "Do you see your father?"
    

      "No ... no!"
    

      "But, be honest—on your honour. By your face I can see you're not
      telling me the truth. If you made a slip of the tongue by mistake, what's
      the use of shuffling. Tell me, do you see him? As one friend to another."
    

      Alyosha mused.
    

      "And you won't tell Mother?" he asked.
    

      "What next."
    

      "On your word of honour."
    

      "My word of honour."
    

      "Swear an oath."
    

      "What a nuisance you are! What do you take me for?"
    

      Alyosha looked round, made big eyes and began to whisper.
    

      "Only for God's sake don't tell Mother! Never tell it to anyone at all,
      because it's a secret. God forbid that Mother should ever get to know;
      then I and Sonya and Pelagueia will pay for it.... Listen. Sonya and I
      meet Father every Tuesday and Friday. When Pelagueia takes us for a walk
      before dinner, we go into Apfel's sweet-shop and Father's waiting for us.
      He always sits in a separate room, you know, where there's a splendid
      marble table and an ash-tray shaped like a goose without a back...."
    

      "And what do you do there?"
    

      "Nothing!—First, we welcome one another, then we sit down at a
      little table and Father begins to treat us to coffee and cakes. You know,
      Sonya eats meat-pies, and I can't bear pies with meat in them! I like them
      made of cabbage and eggs. We eat so much that afterwards at dinner we try
      to eat as much as we possibly can so that Mother shan't notice."
    

      "What do you talk about there?"
    

      "To Father? About anything. He kisses us and cuddles us, tells us all
      kinds of funny stories. You know, he says that he will take us to live
      with him when we are grown up. Sonya doesn't want to go, but I say 'Yes.'
      Of course, it'll be lonely without Mother; but I'll write letters to her.
      How funny: we could go to her for our holidays then—couldn't we?
      Besides, Father says that he'll buy me a horse. He's a splendid man. I
      can't understand why Mother doesn't invite him to live with her or why she
      says we mustn't meet him. He loves Mother very much indeed. He's always
      asking us how she is and what she's doing. When she was ill, he took hold
      of his head like this ... and ran, ran, all the time. He is always telling
      us to obey and respect her. Tell me, is it true that we're unlucky?"
    

      "H'm ... how?"
    

      "Father says so. He says: 'You are unlucky children.' It's quite strange
      to listen to him. He says: 'You are unhappy, I'm unhappy, and Mother's
      unhappy.' He says: 'Pray to God for yourselves and for her.'" Alyosha's
      eyes rested upon the stuffed bird and he mused.
    

      "Exactly...." snorted Byelyaev. "This is what you do. You arrange
      conferences in sweet-shops. And your mother doesn't know?" "N—no....
      How could she know? Pelagueia won't tell for anything. The day before
      yesterday Father stood us pears. Sweet, like jam. I had two."
    

      "H'm ... well, now ... tell me, doesn't your father speak about me?"
    

      "About you? How shall I put it?" Alyosha gave a searching glance to
      Byelyaev's face and shrugged his shoulders.
    

      "He doesn't say anything in particular."
    

      "What does he say, for instance?"
    

      "You won't be offended?"
    

      "What next? Why, does he abuse me?"
    

      "He doesn't abuse you, but you know ... he is cross with you. He says that
      it's through you that Mother's unhappy and that you ... ruined Mother. But
      he is so queer! I explain to him that you are good and never shout at
      Mother, but he only shakes his head."
    

      "Does he say those very words: that I ruined her?"
    

      "Yes. Don't be offended, Nicolai Ilyich!"
    

      Byelyaev got up, stood still a moment, and then began to walk about the
      drawing-room.
    

      "This is strange, and ... funny," he murmured, shrugging his shoulders and
      smiling ironically. "He is to blame all round, and now I've ruined her,
      eh? What an innocent lamb! Did he say those very words to you: that I
      ruined your mother?"
    

      "Yes, but ... you said that you wouldn't get offended."
    

      "I'm not offended, and ... and it's none of your business! No, it ... it's
      quite funny though. I fell, into the trap, yet I'm to be blamed as well."
    

      The bell rang. The boy dashed from his place and ran out. In a minute a
      lady entered the room with a little girl. It was Olga Ivanovna, Alyosha's
      mother. After her, hopping, humming noisily, and waving his hands,
      followed Alyosha.
    

      "Of course, who is there to accuse except me?" he murmured, sniffing.
      "He's right, he's the injured husband."
    

      "What's the matter?" asked Olga Ivanovna.
    

      "What's the matter! Listen to the kind of sermon your dear husband
      preaches. It appears I'm a scoundrel and a murderer, I've ruined you and
      the children. All of you are unhappy, and only I am awfully happy!
      Awfully, awfully happy!"
    

      "I don't understand, Nicolai! What is it?"
    

      "Just listen to this young gentleman," Byelyaev said, pointing to Alyosha.
    

      Alyosha blushed, then became pale suddenly and his whole face was twisted
      in fright.
    

      "Nicolai Ilyich," he whispered loudly. "Shh!"
    

      Olga Ivanovna glanced in surprise at Alyosha, at Byelyaev, and then again
      at Alyosha.
    

      "Ask him, if you please," went on Byelyaev. "That stupid fool Pelagueia of
      yours, takes them to sweet-shops and arranges meetings with their dear
      father there. But that's not the point. The point is that the dear father
      is a martyr, and I'm a murderer, I'm a scoundrel, who broke the lives of
      both of you...."
    

      "Nicolai Ilyich!" moaned Alyosha. "You gave your word of honour!"
    

      "Ah, let me alone!" Byelyaev waved his hand. "This is something more
      important than any words of honour. The hypocrisy revolts me, the lie!"
    

      "I don't understand," muttered Olga Ivanovna, and tears began to glimmer
      in her eyes. "Tell me, Lyolka,"—she turned to her son, "Do you see
      your father?"
    

      Alyosha did not hear and looked with horror at Byelyaev.
    

      "It's impossible," said the mother. "I'll go and ask Pelagueia."
    

      Olga Ivanovna went out.
    

      "But, but you gave me your word of honour," Alyosha said trembling all
      over.
    

      Byelyaev waved his hand at him and went on walking up and down. He was
      absorbed in his insult, and now, as before, he did not notice the presence
      of the boy. He, a big serious man, had nothing to do with boys. And
      Alyosha sat down in a corner and in terror told Sonya how he had been
      deceived. He trembled, stammered, wept. This was the first time in his
      life that he had been set, roughly, face to face with a lie. He had never
      known before that in this world besides sweet pears and cakes and
      expensive watches, there exist many other things which have no name in
      children's language.
    





      When she came out of the hospital the charming Vanda, or, according to her
      passport, "the honourable lady-citizen Nastasya Kanavkina," found herself
      in a position in which she had never been before: without a roof and
      without a son. What was to be done?
    

      First of all, she went to a pawnshop to pledge her turquoise ring, her
      only jewellery. They gave her a rouble for the ring ... but what can you
      buy for a rouble? For that you can't get a short jacket Ã  la mode,
      or an elaborate hat, or a pair of brown shoes; yet without these things
      she felt naked. She felt as though, not only the people, but even the
      horses and dogs were staring at her and laughing at the plainness of her
      clothes. And her only thought was for her clothes; she did not care at all
      what she ate or where she slept.
    

      "If only I were to meet a gentleman friend...." she thought. "I could get
      some money ... Nobody would say 'No,' because...."
    

      But she came across no gentleman Mends. It's easy to find them of nights
      in the Renaissance, but they wouldn't let her go into the Renaissance
      in that plain dress and without a hat. What's to be done? After a long
      time of anguish, vexed and weary with walking, sitting, and thinking,
      Vanda made up her mind to play her last card: to go straight to the rooms
      of some gentleman friend and ask him for money.
    

      "But who shall I go to?" she pondered. "I can't possibly go to Misha ...
      he's got a family.... The ginger-headed old man is at his office...."
    

      Vanda recollected Finkel, the dentist, the converted Jew, who gave her a
      bracelet three months ago. Once she poured a glass of beer on his head at
      the German dub. She was awfully glad that she had thought of Finkel.
    

      "He'll be certain to give me some, if only I find him in..." she thought,
      on her way to him. "And if he won't, then I'll break every single thing
      there."
    

      She had her plan already prepared. She approached the dentist's door. She
      would run up the stairs, with a laugh, fly into his private room and ask
      for twenty-five roubles.... But when she took hold of the bell-pull, the
      plan went clean out of her head. Vanda suddenly began to be afraid and
      agitated, a thing which had never happened to her before. She was never
      anything but bold and independent in drunken company; but now, dressed in
      common clothes, and just like any ordinary person begging a favour, she
      felt timid and humble.
    

      "Perhaps he has forgotten me..." she thought, not daring to pull the bell.
      "And how can I go up to him in a dress like this? As if I were a pauper,
      or a dowdy respectable..."
    

      She rang the bell irresolutely.
    

      There were steps behind the door. It was the porter.
    

      "Is the doctor at home?" she asked.
    

      She would have been very pleased now if the porter had said "No," but
      instead of answering he showed her into the hall, and took her jacket. The
      stairs seemed to her luxurious and magnificent, but what she noticed first
      of all in all the luxury was a large mirror in which she saw a ragged
      creature without an elaborate hat, without a modish jacket, and without a
      pair of brown shoes. And Vanda found it strange that, now that she was
      poorly dressed and looking more like a seamstress or a washerwoman, for
      the first time she felt ashamed, and had no more assurance or boldness
      left. In her thoughts she began to call herself Nastya Kanavkina, instead
      of Vanda as she used.
    

      "This way, please!" said the maid-servant, leading her to the private
      room. "The doctor will be here immediately.... Please, take a seat."
    

      Vanda dropped into an easy chair.
    

      "I'll say: 'Lend me ...'" she thought. "That's the right thing, because we
      are acquainted. But the maid must go out of the room.... It's awkward in
      front of the maid.... What is she standing there for?"
    

      In five minutes the door opened and Finkel entered—a tall, swarthy,
      convert Jew, with fat cheeks and goggle-eyes. His cheeks, eyes, belly,
      fleshy hips—were all so full, repulsive, and coarse! At the Renaissance
      and the German club he used always to be a little drunk, to spend a lot of
      money on women, patiently put up with all their tricks—for instance,
      when Vanda poured the beer on his head, he only smiled and shook his
      finger at her—but now he looked dull and sleepy; he had the pompous,
      chilly expression of a superior, and he was chewing something.
    

      "What is the matter?" he asked, without looking at Vanda. Vanda glanced at
      the maid's serious face, at the blown-out figure of Finkel, who obviously
      did not recognise her, and she blushed.
    

      "What's the matter?" the dentist repeated, irritated.
    

      "To ... oth ache...." whispered Vanda.
    

      "Ah ... which tooth ... where?"
    

      Vanda remembered she had a tooth with a hole.
    

      "At the bottom ... to the right," she said.
    

      "H'm ... open your mouth."
    

      Finkel frowned, held his breath, and began to work the aching tooth loose.
    

      "Do you feel any pain?" he asked, picking at her tooth with some
      instrument.
    

      "Yes, I do...." Vanda lied. "Shall I remind him?" she thought, "he'll be
      sure to remember.... But ... the maid ... what is she standing there for?"
    

      Finkel suddenly snorted like a steam-engine straight into her mouth, and
      said:
    

      "I don't advise you to have a stopping.... Anyhow the tooth is quite
      useless."
    

      Again he picked at the tooth for a little, and soiled Vanda's lips and
      gums with his tobacco-stained fingers. Again he held his breath and dived
      into her mouth with something cold....
    

      Vanda suddenly felt a terrible pain, shrieked and seized Finkel's hand....
    

      "Never mind...." he murmured. "Don't be frightened.... This tooth isn't
      any use."
    

      And his tobacco-stained fingers, covered with blood, held up the extracted
      tooth before her eyes. The maid came forward and put a bowl to her lips.
    

      "Rinse your mouth with cold water at home," said Finkel. "That will make
      the blood stop."
    

      He stood before her in the attitude of a man impatient to be left alone at
      last.
    

      "Good-bye ..." she said, turning to the door.
    

      "H'm! And who's to pay me for the work?" Finkel asked laughingly.
    

      "Ah ... yes!" Vanda recollected, blushed and gave the dentist the rouble
      she had got for the turquoise ring.
    

      When she came into the street she felt still more ashamed than before, but
      she was not ashamed of her poverty any more. Nor did she notice any more
      that she hadn't an elaborate hat or a modish jacket. She walked along the
      street spitting blood and each red spittle told her about her life, a bad,
      hard life; about the insults she had suffered and had still to
      suffer-to-morrow, a week, a year hence—her whole life, till
      death....
    

      "Oh, how terrible it is!" she whispered. "My God, how terrible!"
    

      But the next day she was at the Renaissance and she danced there.
      She wore a new, immense red hat, a new jacket Ã  la mode and a pair
      of brown shoes. She was treated to supper by a young merchant from Kazan.
