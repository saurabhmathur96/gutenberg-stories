THE KISS

  A

T eight o’clock
      on the evening of the twentieth of May all the six batteries of the N——
      Reserve Artillery Brigade halted for the night in the village of
      Myestetchki on their way to camp. When the general commotion was at its
      height, while some officers were busily occupied around the guns, while
      others, gathered together in the square near the church enclosure, were
      listening to the quartermasters, a man in civilian dress, riding a strange
      horse, came into sight round the church. The little dun-coloured horse
      with a good neck and a short tail came, moving not straight forward, but
      as it were sideways, with a sort of dance step, as though it were being
      lashed about the legs. When he reached the officers the man on the horse
      took off his hat and said:

 “His Excellency Lieutenant-General von Rabbek invites the gentlemen
      to drink tea with him this minute. . . .”

 The horse turned, danced, and retired sideways; the messenger raised his
      hat once more, and in an instant disappeared with his strange horse behind
      the church.

 “What the devil does it mean?” grumbled some of the officers,
      dispersing to their quarters. “One is sleepy, and here this Von
      Rabbek with his tea! We know what tea means.”

 The officers of all the six batteries remembered vividly an incident of
      the previous year, when during manoeuvres they, together with the officers
      of a Cossack regiment, were in the same way invited to tea by a count who
      had an estate in the neighbourhood and was a retired army officer: the
      hospitable and genial count made much of them, fed them, and gave them
      drink, refused to let them go to their quarters in the village and made
      them stay the night. All that, of course, was very nice—nothing
      better could be desired, but the worst of it was, the old army officer was
      so carried away by the pleasure of the young men’s company that till
      sunrise he was telling the officers anecdotes of his glorious past, taking
      them over the house, showing them expensive pictures, old engravings, rare
      guns, reading them autograph letters from great people, while the weary
      and exhausted officers looked and listened, longing for their beds and
      yawning in their sleeves; when at last their host let them go, it was too
      late for sleep.

 Might not this Von Rabbek be just such another? Whether he were or not,
      there was no help for it. The officers changed their uniforms, brushed
      themselves, and went all together in search of the gentleman’s
      house. In the square by the church they were told they could get to His
      Excellency’s by the lower path—going down behind the church to
      the river, going along the bank to the garden, and there an avenue would
      taken them to the house; or by the upper way— straight from the
      church by the road which, half a mile from the village, led right up to
      His Excellency’s granaries. The officers decided to go by the upper
      way.

 “What Von Rabbek is it?” they wondered on the way. “Surely
      not the one who was in command of the N—— cavalry division at
      Plevna?”

 “No, that was not Von Rabbek, but simply Rabbe and no ‘von.’”

 “What lovely weather!”

 At the first of the granaries the road divided in two: one branch went
      straight on and vanished in the evening darkness, the other led to the
      owner’s house on the right. The officers turned to the right and
      began to speak more softly. . . . On both sides of the road stretched
      stone granaries with red roofs, heavy and sullen-looking, very much like
      barracks of a district town. Ahead of them gleamed the windows of the
      manor-house.

 “A good omen, gentlemen,” said one of the officers. “Our
      setter is the foremost of all; no doubt he scents game ahead of us! . . .”

 Lieutenant Lobytko, who was walking in front, a tall and stalwart fellow,
      though entirely without moustache (he was over five-and-twenty, yet for
      some reason there was no sign of hair on his round, well-fed face),
      renowned in the brigade for his peculiar faculty for divining the presence
      of women at a distance, turned round and said:

 “Yes, there must be women here; I feel that by instinct.”

 On the threshold the officers were met by Von Rabbek himself, a
      comely-looking man of sixty in civilian dress. Shaking hands with his
      guests, he said that he was very glad and happy to see them, but begged
      them earnestly for God’s sake to excuse him for not asking them to
      stay the night; two sisters with their children, some brothers, and some
      neighbours, had come on a visit to him, so that he had not one spare room
      left.

 The General shook hands with every one, made his apologies, and smiled,
      but it was evident by his face that he was by no means so delighted as
      their last year’s count, and that he had invited the officers simply
      because, in his opinion, it was a social obligation to do so. And the
      officers themselves, as they walked up the softly carpeted stairs, as they
      listened to him, felt that they had been invited to this house simply
      because it would have been awkward not to invite them; and at the sight of
      the footmen, who hastened to light the lamps in the entrance below and in
      the anteroom above, they began to feel as though they had brought
      uneasiness and discomfort into the house with them. In a house in which
      two sisters and their children, brothers, and neighbours were gathered
      together, probably on account of some family festivity, or event, how
      could the presence of nineteen unknown officers possibly be welcome?

 At the entrance to the drawing-room the officers were met by a tall,
      graceful old lady with black eyebrows and a long face, very much like the
      Empress Eugénie. Smiling graciously and majestically, she said she was
      glad and happy to see her guests, and apologized that her husband and she
      were on this occasion unable to invite messieurs les officiers to
      stay the night. From her beautiful majestic smile, which instantly
      vanished from her face every time she turned away from her guests, it was
      evident that she had seen numbers of officers in her day, that she was in
      no humour for them now, and if she invited them to her house and
      apologized for not doing more, it was only because her breeding and
      position in society required it of her.

 When the officers went into the big dining-room, there were about a dozen
      people, men and ladies, young and old, sitting at tea at the end of a long
      table. A group of men was dimly visible behind their chairs, wrapped in a
      haze of cigar smoke; and in the midst of them stood a lanky young man with
      red whiskers, talking loudly, with a lisp, in English. Through a door
      beyond the group could be seen a light room with pale blue furniture.

 “Gentlemen, there are so many of you that it is impossible to
      introduce you all!” said the General in a loud voice, trying to
      sound very cheerful. “Make each other’s acquaintance,
      gentlemen, without any ceremony!”

 The officers—some with very serious and even stern faces, others
      with forced smiles, and all feeling extremely awkward—somehow made
      their bows and sat down to tea.

 The most ill at ease of them all was Ryabovitch—a little officer in
      spectacles, with sloping shoulders, and whiskers like a lynx’s.
      While some of his comrades assumed a serious expression, while others wore
      forced smiles, his face, his lynx-like whiskers, and spectacles seemed to
      say: “I am the shyest, most modest, and most undistinguished officer
      in the whole brigade!” At first, on going into the room and sitting
      down to the table, he could not fix his attention on any one face or
      object. The faces, the dresses, the cut-glass decanters of brandy, the
      steam from the glasses, the moulded cornices—all blended in one
      general impression that inspired in Ryabovitch alarm and a desire to hide
      his head. Like a lecturer making his first appearance before the public,
      he saw everything that was before his eyes, but apparently only had a dim
      understanding of it (among physiologists this condition, when the subject
      sees but does not understand, is called psychical blindness). After a
      little while, growing accustomed to his surroundings, Ryabovitch saw
      clearly and began to observe. As a shy man, unused to society, what struck
      him first was that in which he had always been deficient—namely, the
      extraordinary boldness of his new acquaintances. Von Rabbek, his wife, two
      elderly ladies, a young lady in a lilac dress, and the young man with the
      red whiskers, who was, it appeared, a younger son of Von Rabbek, very
      cleverly, as though they had rehearsed it beforehand, took seats between
      the officers, and at once got up a heated discussion in which the visitors
      could not help taking part. The lilac young lady hotly asserted that the
      artillery had a much better time than the cavalry and the infantry, while
      Von Rabbek and the elderly ladies maintained the opposite. A brisk
      interchange of talk followed. Ryabovitch watched the lilac young lady who
      argued so hotly about what was unfamiliar and utterly uninteresting to
      her, and watched artificial smiles come and go on her face.

 Von Rabbek and his family skilfully drew the officers into the discussion,
      and meanwhile kept a sharp lookout over their glasses and mouths, to see
      whether all of them were drinking, whether all had enough sugar, why some
      one was not eating cakes or not drinking brandy. And the longer Ryabovitch
      watched and listened, the more he was attracted by this insincere but
      splendidly disciplined family.

 After tea the officers went into the drawing-room. Lieutenant Lobytko’s
      instinct had not deceived him. There were a great number of girls and
      young married ladies. The “setter” lieutenant was soon
      standing by a very young, fair girl in a black dress, and, bending down to
      her jauntily, as though leaning on an unseen sword, smiled and shrugged
      his shoulders coquettishly. He probably talked very interesting nonsense,
      for the fair girl looked at his well-fed face condescendingly and asked
      indifferently, “Really?” And from that uninterested “Really?”
      the setter, had he been intelligent, might have concluded that she would
      never call him to heel.

 The piano struck up; the melancholy strains of a valse floated out of the
      wide open windows, and every one, for some reason, remembered that it was
      spring, a May evening. Every one was conscious of the fragrance of roses,
      of lilac, and of the young leaves of the poplar. Ryabovitch, in whom the
      brandy he had drunk made itself felt, under the influence of the music
      stole a glance towards the window, smiled, and began watching the
      movements of the women, and it seemed to him that the smell of roses, of
      poplars, and lilac came not from the garden, but from the ladies’
      faces and dresses.

 Von Rabbek’s son invited a scraggy-looking young lady to dance, and
      waltzed round the room twice with her. Lobytko, gliding over the parquet
      floor, flew up to the lilac young lady and whirled her away. Dancing
      began. . . . Ryabovitch stood near the door among those who were not
      dancing and looked on. He had never once danced in his whole life, and he
      had never once in his life put his arm round the waist of a respectable
      woman. He was highly delighted that a man should in the sight of all take
      a girl he did not know round the waist and offer her his shoulder to put
      her hand on, but he could not imagine himself in the position of such a
      man. There were times when he envied the boldness and swagger of his
      companions and was inwardly wretched; the consciousness that he was timid,
      that he was round-shouldered and uninteresting, that he had a long waist
      and lynx-like whiskers, had deeply mortified him, but with years he had
      grown used to this feeling, and now, looking at his comrades dancing or
      loudly talking, he no longer envied them, but only felt touched and
      mournful.

 When the quadrille began, young Von Rabbek came up to those who were not
      dancing and invited two officers to have a game at billiards. The officers
      accepted and went with him out of the drawing-room. Ryabovitch, having
      nothing to do and wishing to take part in the general movement, slouched
      after them. From the big drawing-room they went into the little
      drawing-room, then into a narrow corridor with a glass roof, and thence
      into a room in which on their entrance three sleepy-looking footmen jumped
      up quickly from the sofa. At last, after passing through a long succession
      of rooms, young Von Rabbek and the officers came into a small room where
      there was a billiard-table. They began to play.

 Ryabovitch, who had never played any game but cards, stood near the
      billiard-table and looked indifferently at the players, while they in
      unbuttoned coats, with cues in their hands, stepped about, made puns, and
      kept shouting out unintelligible words.

 The players took no notice of him, and only now and then one of them,
      shoving him with his elbow or accidentally touching him with the end of
      his cue, would turn round and say “Pardon!” Before the first
      game was over he was weary of it, and began to feel he was not wanted and
      in the way. . . . He felt disposed to return to the drawing-room, and he
      went out.

 On his way back he met with a little adventure. When he had gone half-way
      he noticed he had taken a wrong turning. He distinctly remembered that he
      ought to meet three sleepy footmen on his way, but he had passed five or
      six rooms, and those sleepy figures seemed to have vanished into the
      earth. Noticing his mistake, he walked back a little way and turned to the
      right; he found himself in a little dark room which he had not seen on his
      way to the billiard-room. After standing there a little while, he
      resolutely opened the first door that met his eyes and walked into an
      absolutely dark room. Straight in front could be seen the crack in the
      doorway through which there was a gleam of vivid light; from the other
      side of the door came the muffled sound of a melancholy mazurka. Here,
      too, as in the drawing-room, the windows were wide open and there was a
      smell of poplars, lilac and roses. . . .

 Ryabovitch stood still in hesitation. . . . At that moment, to his
      surprise, he heard hurried footsteps and the rustling of a dress, a
      breathless feminine voice whispered “At last!” And two soft,
      fragrant, unmistakably feminine arms were clasped about his neck; a warm
      cheek was pressed to his cheek, and simultaneously there was the sound of
      a kiss. But at once the bestower of the kiss uttered a faint shriek and
      skipped back from him, as it seemed to Ryabovitch, with aversion. He, too,
      almost shrieked and rushed towards the gleam of light at the door. . . .

 When he went back into the drawing-room his heart was beating and his
      hands were trembling so noticeably that he made haste to hide them behind
      his back. At first he was tormented by shame and dread that the whole
      drawing-room knew that he had just been kissed and embraced by a woman. He
      shrank into himself and looked uneasily about him, but as he became
      convinced that people were dancing and talking as calmly as ever, he gave
      himself up entirely to the new sensation which he had never experienced
      before in his life. Something strange was happening to him. . . . His
      neck, round which soft, fragrant arms had so lately been clasped, seemed
      to him to be anointed with oil; on his left cheek near his moustache where
      the unknown had kissed him there was a faint chilly tingling sensation as
      from peppermint drops, and the more he rubbed the place the more distinct
      was the chilly sensation; all over, from head to foot, he was full of a
      strange new feeling which grew stronger and stronger . . . . He wanted to
      dance, to talk, to run into the garden, to laugh aloud. . . . He quite
      forgot that he was round-shouldered and uninteresting, that he had
      lynx-like whiskers and an “undistinguished appearance” (that
      was how his appearance had been described by some ladies whose
      conversation he had accidentally overheard). When Von Rabbek’s wife
      happened to pass by him, he gave her such a broad and friendly smile that
      she stood still and looked at him inquiringly.

 “I like your house immensely!” he said, setting his spectacles
      straight.

 The General’s wife smiled and said that the house had belonged to
      her father; then she asked whether his parents were living, whether he had
      long been in the army, why he was so thin, and so on. . . . After
      receiving answers to her questions, she went on, and after his
      conversation with her his smiles were more friendly than ever, and he
      thought he was surrounded by splendid people. . . .

 At supper Ryabovitch ate mechanically everything offered him, drank, and
      without listening to anything, tried to understand what had just happened
      to him. . . . The adventure was of a mysterious and romantic character,
      but it was not difficult to explain it. No doubt some girl or young
      married lady had arranged a tryst with some one in the dark room; had
      waited a long time, and being nervous and excited had taken Ryabovitch for
      her hero; this was the more probable as Ryabovitch had stood still
      hesitating in the dark room, so that he, too, had seemed like a person
      expecting something. . . . This was how Ryabovitch explained to himself
      the kiss he had received.

 “And who is she?” he wondered, looking round at the women’s
      faces. “She must be young, for elderly ladies don’t give
      rendezvous. That she was a lady, one could tell by the rustle of her
      dress, her perfume, her voice. . . .”

 His eyes rested on the lilac young lady, and he thought her very
      attractive; she had beautiful shoulders and arms, a clever face, and a
      delightful voice. Ryabovitch, looking at her, hoped that she and no one
      else was his unknown. . . . But she laughed somehow artificially and
      wrinkled up her long nose, which seemed to him to make her look old. Then
      he turned his eyes upon the fair girl in a black dress. She was younger,
      simpler, and more genuine, had a charming brow, and drank very daintily
      out of her wineglass. Ryabovitch now hoped that it was she. But soon he
      began to think her face flat, and fixed his eyes upon the one next her.

 “It’s difficult to guess,” he thought, musing. “If
      one takes the shoulders and arms of the lilac one only, adds the brow of
      the fair one and the eyes of the one on the left of Lobytko, then . . .”

 He made a combination of these things in his mind and so formed the image
      of the girl who had kissed him, the image that he wanted her to have, but
      could not find at the table. . . .

 After supper, replete and exhilarated, the officers began to take leave
      and say thank you. Von Rabbek and his wife began again apologizing that
      they could not ask them to stay the night.

 “Very, very glad to have met you, gentlemen,” said Von Rabbek,
      and this time sincerely (probably because people are far more sincere and
      good-humoured at speeding their parting guests than on meeting them).
      “Delighted. I hope you will come on your way back! Don’t stand
      on ceremony! Where are you going? Do you want to go by the upper way? No,
      go across the garden; it’s nearer here by the lower way.”

 The officers went out into the garden. After the bright light and the
      noise the garden seemed very dark and quiet. They walked in silence all
      the way to the gate. They were a little drunk, pleased, and in good
      spirits, but the darkness and silence made them thoughtful for a minute.
      Probably the same idea occurred to each one of them as to Ryabovitch:
      would there ever come a time for them when, like Von Rabbek, they would
      have a large house, a family, a garden— when they, too, would be
      able to welcome people, even though insincerely, feed them, make them
      drunk and contented?

 Going out of the garden gate, they all began talking at once and laughing
      loudly about nothing. They were walking now along the little path that led
      down to the river, and then ran along the water’s edge, winding
      round the bushes on the bank, the pools, and the willows that overhung the
      water. The bank and the path were scarcely visible, and the other bank was
      entirely plunged in darkness. Stars were reflected here and there on the
      dark water; they quivered and were broken up on the surface—and from
      that alone it could be seen that the river was flowing rapidly. It was
      still. Drowsy curlews cried plaintively on the further bank, and in one of
      the bushes on the nearest side a nightingale was trilling loudly, taking
      no notice of the crowd of officers. The officers stood round the bush,
      touched it, but the nightingale went on singing.

 “What a fellow!” they exclaimed approvingly. “We stand
      beside him and he takes not a bit of notice! What a rascal!”

 At the end of the way the path went uphill, and, skirting the church
      enclosure, turned into the road. Here the officers, tired with walking
      uphill, sat down and lighted their cigarettes. On the other side of the
      river a murky red fire came into sight, and having nothing better to do,
      they spent a long time in discussing whether it was a camp fire or a light
      in a window, or something else. . . . Ryabovitch, too, looked at the
      light, and he fancied that the light looked and winked at him, as though
      it knew about the kiss.

 On reaching his quarters, Ryabovitch undressed as quickly as possible and
      got into bed. Lobytko and Lieutenant Merzlyakov—a peaceable, silent
      fellow, who was considered in his own circle a highly educated officer,
      and was always, whenever it was possible, reading the “Vyestnik
      Evropi,” which he carried about with him everywhere— were
      quartered in the same hut with Ryabovitch. Lobytko undressed, walked up
      and down the room for a long while with the air of a man who has not been
      satisfied, and sent his orderly for beer. Merzlyakov got into bed, put a
      candle by his pillow and plunged into reading the “Vyestnik Evropi.”

 “Who was she?” Ryabovitch wondered, looking at the smoky
      ceiling.

 His neck still felt as though he had been anointed with oil, and there was
      still the chilly sensation near his mouth as though from peppermint drops.
      The shoulders and arms of the young lady in lilac, the brow and the
      truthful eyes of the fair girl in black, waists, dresses, and brooches,
      floated through his imagination. He tried to fix his attention on these
      images, but they danced about, broke up and flickered. When these images
      vanished altogether from the broad dark background which every man sees
      when he closes his eyes, he began to hear hurried footsteps, the rustle of
      skirts, the sound of a kiss and—an intense groundless joy took
      possession of him . . . . Abandoning himself to this joy, he heard the
      orderly return and announce that there was no beer. Lobytko was terribly
      indignant, and began pacing up and down again.

 “Well, isn’t he an idiot?” he kept saying, stopping
      first before Ryabovitch and then before Merzlyakov. “What a fool and
      a dummy a man must be not to get hold of any beer! Eh? Isn’t he a
      scoundrel?”

 “Of course you can’t get beer here,” said Merzlyakov,
      not removing his eyes from the “Vyestnik Evropi.”

 “Oh! Is that your opinion?” Lobytko persisted. “Lord
      have mercy upon us, if you dropped me on the moon I’d find you beer
      and women directly! I’ll go and find some at once. . . . You may
      call me an impostor if I don’t!”

 He spent a long time in dressing and pulling on his high boots, then
      finished smoking his cigarette in silence and went out.

 “Rabbek, Grabbek, Labbek,” he muttered, stopping in the outer
      room. “I don’t care to go alone, damn it all! Ryabovitch,
      wouldn’t you like to go for a walk? Eh?”

 Receiving no answer, he returned, slowly undressed and got into bed.
      Merzlyakov sighed, put the “Vyestnik Evropi” away, and put out
      the light.

 “H’m! . . .” muttered Lobytko, lighting a cigarette in
      the dark.

 Ryabovitch pulled the bed-clothes over his head, curled himself up in bed,
      and tried to gather together the floating images in his mind and to
      combine them into one whole. But nothing came of it. He soon fell asleep,
      and his last thought was that some one had caressed him and made him happy—that
      something extraordinary, foolish, but joyful and delightful, had come into
      his life. The thought did not leave him even in his sleep.

 When he woke up the sensations of oil on his neck and the chill of
      peppermint about his lips had gone, but joy flooded his heart just as the
      day before. He looked enthusiastically at the window-frames, gilded by the
      light of the rising sun, and listened to the movement of the passers-by in
      the street. People were talking loudly close to the window. Lebedetsky,
      the commander of Ryabovitch’s battery, who had only just overtaken
      the brigade, was talking to his sergeant at the top of his voice, being
      always accustomed to shout.

 “What else?” shouted the commander.

 “When they were shoeing yesterday, your high nobility, they drove a
      nail into Pigeon’s hoof. The vet. put on clay and vinegar; they are
      leading him apart now. And also, your honour, Artemyev got drunk
      yesterday, and the lieutenant ordered him to be put in the limber of a
      spare gun-carriage.”

 The sergeant reported that Karpov had forgotten the new cords for the
      trumpets and the rings for the tents, and that their honours, the
      officers, had spent the previous evening visiting General Von Rabbek. In
      the middle of this conversation the red-bearded face of Lebedetsky
      appeared in the window. He screwed up his short-sighted eyes, looking at
      the sleepy faces of the officers, and said good-morning to them.

 “Is everything all right?” he asked.

 “One of the horses has a sore neck from the new collar,”
      answered Lobytko, yawning.

 The commander sighed, thought a moment, and said in a loud voice:

 “I am thinking of going to see Alexandra Yevgrafovna. I must call on
      her. Well, good-bye. I shall catch you up in the evening.”

 A quarter of an hour later the brigade set off on its way. When it was
      moving along the road by the granaries, Ryabovitch looked at the house on
      the right. The blinds were down in all the windows. Evidently the
      household was still asleep. The one who had kissed Ryabovitch the day
      before was asleep, too. He tried to imagine her asleep. The wide-open
      windows of the bedroom, the green branches peeping in, the morning
      freshness, the scent of the poplars, lilac, and roses, the bed, a chair,
      and on it the skirts that had rustled the day before, the little slippers,
      the little watch on the table —all this he pictured to himself
      clearly and distinctly, but the features of the face, the sweet sleepy
      smile, just what was characteristic and important, slipped through his
      imagination like quicksilver through the fingers. When he had ridden on
      half a mile, he looked back: the yellow church, the house, and the river,
      were all bathed in light; the river with its bright green banks, with the
      blue sky reflected in it and glints of silver in the sunshine here and
      there, was very beautiful. Ryabovitch gazed for the last time at
      Myestetchki, and he felt as sad as though he were parting with something
      very near and dear to him.

 And before him on the road lay nothing but long familiar, uninteresting
      pictures. . . . To right and to left, fields of young rye and buckwheat
      with rooks hopping about in them. If one looked ahead, one saw dust and
      the backs of men’s heads; if one looked back, one saw the same dust
      and faces. . . . Foremost of all marched four men with sabres—this
      was the vanguard. Next, behind, the crowd of singers, and behind them the
      trumpeters on horseback. The vanguard and the chorus of singers, like
      torch-bearers in a funeral procession, often forgot to keep the regulation
      distance and pushed a long way ahead. . . . Ryabovitch was with the first
      cannon of the fifth battery. He could see all the four batteries moving in
      front of him. For any one not a military man this long tedious procession
      of a moving brigade seems an intricate and unintelligible muddle; one
      cannot understand why there are so many people round one cannon, and why
      it is drawn by so many horses in such a strange network of harness, as
      though it really were so terrible and heavy. To Ryabovitch it was all
      perfectly comprehensible and therefore uninteresting. He had known for
      ever so long why at the head of each battery there rode a stalwart
      bombardier, and why he was called a bombardier; immediately behind this
      bombardier could be seen the horsemen of the first and then of the middle
      units. Ryabovitch knew that the horses on which they rode, those on the
      left, were called one name, while those on the right were called another—it
      was extremely uninteresting. Behind the horsemen came two shaft-horses. On
      one of them sat a rider with the dust of yesterday on his back and a
      clumsy and funny-looking piece of wood on his leg. Ryabovitch knew the
      object of this piece of wood, and did not think it funny. All the riders
      waved their whips mechanically and shouted from time to time. The cannon
      itself was ugly. On the fore part lay sacks of oats covered with canvas,
      and the cannon itself was hung all over with kettles, soldiers’
      knapsacks, bags, and looked like some small harmless animal surrounded for
      some unknown reason by men and horses. To the leeward of it marched six
      men, the gunners, swinging their arms. After the cannon there came again
      more bombardiers, riders, shaft-horses, and behind them another cannon, as
      ugly and unimpressive as the first. After the second followed a third, a
      fourth; near the fourth an officer, and so on. There were six batteries in
      all in the brigade, and four cannons in each battery. The procession
      covered half a mile; it ended in a string of wagons near which an
      extremely attractive creature—the ass, Magar, brought by a battery
      commander from Turkey—paced pensively with his long-eared head
      drooping.

 Ryabovitch looked indifferently before and behind, at the backs of heads
      and at faces; at any other time he would have been half asleep, but now he
      was entirely absorbed in his new agreeable thoughts. At first when the
      brigade was setting off on the march he tried to persuade himself that the
      incident of the kiss could only be interesting as a mysterious little
      adventure, that it was in reality trivial, and to think of it seriously,
      to say the least of it, was stupid; but now he bade farewell to logic and
      gave himself up to dreams. . . . At one moment he imagined himself in Von
      Rabbek’s drawing-room beside a girl who was like the young lady in
      lilac and the fair girl in black; then he would close his eyes and see
      himself with another, entirely unknown girl, whose features were very
      vague. In his imagination he talked, caressed her, leaned on her shoulder,
      pictured war, separation, then meeting again, supper with his wife,
      children. . . .

 “Brakes on!” the word of command rang out every time they went
      downhill.

 He, too, shouted “Brakes on!” and was afraid this shout would
      disturb his reverie and bring him back to reality. . . .

 As they passed by some landowner’s estate Ryabovitch looked over the
      fence into the garden. A long avenue, straight as a ruler, strewn with
      yellow sand and bordered with young birch-trees, met his eyes. . . . With
      the eagerness of a man given up to dreaming, he pictured to himself little
      feminine feet tripping along yellow sand, and quite unexpectedly had a
      clear vision in his imagination of the girl who had kissed him and whom he
      had succeeded in picturing to himself the evening before at supper. This
      image remained in his brain and did not desert him again.

 At midday there was a shout in the rear near the string of wagons:

 “Easy! Eyes to the left! Officers!”

 The general of the brigade drove by in a carriage with a pair of white
      horses. He stopped near the second battery, and shouted something which no
      one understood. Several officers, among them Ryabovitch, galloped up to
      them.

 “Well?” asked the general, bClinking his red eyes. “Are
      there any sick?”

 Receiving an answer, the general, a little skinny man, chewed, thought for
      a moment and said, addressing one of the officers:

 “One of your drivers of the third cannon has taken off his leg-guard
      and hung it on the fore part of the cannon, the rascal. Reprimand him.”

 He raised his eyes to Ryabovitch and went on:

 “It seems to me your front strap is too long.”

 Making a few other tedious remarks, the general looked at Lobytko and
      grinned.

 “You look very melancholy today, Lieutenant Lobytko,” he said.
      “Are you pining for Madame Lopuhov? Eh? Gentlemen, he is pining for
      Madame Lopuhov.”

 The lady in question was a very stout and tall person who had long passed
      her fortieth year. The general, who had a predilection for solid ladies,
      whatever their ages, suspected a similar taste in his officers. The
      officers smiled respectfully. The general, delighted at having said
      something very amusing and biting, laughed loudly, touched his coachman’s
      back, and saluted. The carriage rolled on. . . .

 “All I am dreaming about now which seems to me so impossible and
      unearthly is really quite an ordinary thing,” thought Ryabovitch,
      looking at the clouds of dust racing after the general’s carriage.
      “It’s all very ordinary, and every one goes through it. . . .
      That general, for instance, has once been in love; now he is married and
      has children. Captain Vahter, too, is married and beloved, though the nape
      of his neck is very red and ugly and he has no waist. . . . Salrnanov is
      coarse and very Tatar, but he has had a love affair that has ended in
      marriage. . . . I am the same as every one else, and I, too, shall have
      the same experience as every one else, sooner or later. . . .”

 And the thought that he was an ordinary person, and that his life was
      ordinary, delighted him and gave him courage. He pictured her and his
      happiness as he pleased, and put no rein on his imagination.

 When the brigade reached their halting-place in the evening, and the
      officers were resting in their tents, Ryabovitch, Merzlyakov, and Lobytko
      were sitting round a box having supper. Merzlyakov ate without haste, and,
      as he munched deliberately, read the “Vyestnik Evropi,” which
      he held on his knees. Lobytko talked incessantly and kept filling up his
      glass with beer, and Ryabovitch, whose head was confused from dreaming all
      day long, drank and said nothing. After three glasses he got a little
      drunk, felt weak, and had an irresistible desire to impart his new
      sensations to his comrades.

 “A strange thing happened to me at those Von Rabbeks’,”
      he began, trying to put an indifferent and ironical tone into his voice.
      “You know I went into the billiard-room. . . .”

 He began describing very minutely the incident of the kiss, and a moment
      later relapsed into silence. . . . In the course of that moment he had
      told everything, and it surprised him dreadfully to find how short a time
      it took him to tell it. He had imagined that he could have been telling
      the story of the kiss till next morning. Listening to him, Lobytko, who
      was a great liar and consequently believed no one, looked at him
      sceptically and laughed. Merzlyakov twitched his eyebrows and, without
      removing his eyes from the “Vyestnik Evropi,” said:

 “That’s an odd thing! How strange! . . . throws herself on a
      man’s neck, without addressing him by name. .. . She must be some
      sort of hysterical neurotic.”

 “Yes, she must,” Ryabovitch agreed.

 “A similar thing once happened to me,” said Lobytko, assuming
      a scared expression. “I was going last year to Kovno. . . . I took a
      second-class ticket. The train was crammed, and it was impossible to
      sleep. I gave the guard half a rouble; he took my luggage and led me to
      another compartment. . . . I lay down and covered myself with a rug. . . .
      It was dark, you understand. Suddenly I felt some one touch me on the
      shoulder and breathe in my face. I made a movement with my hand and felt
      somebody’s elbow. . . . I opened my eyes and only imagine—a
      woman. Black eyes, lips red as a prime salmon, nostrils breathing
      passionately—a bosom like a buffer. . . .”

 “Excuse me,” Merzlyakov interrupted calmly, “I
      understand about the bosom, but how could you see the lips if it was dark?”

 Lobytko began trying to put himself right and laughing at Merzlyakov’s
      unimaginativeness. It made Ryabovitch wince. He walked away from the box,
      got into bed, and vowed never to confide again.

 Camp life began. . . . The days flowed by, one very much like another. All
      those days Ryabovitch felt, thought, and behaved as though he were in
      love. Every morning when his orderly handed him water to wash with, and he
      sluiced his head with cold water, he thought there was something warm and
      delightful in his life.

 In the evenings when his comrades began talking of love and women, he
      would listen, and draw up closer; and he wore the expression of a soldier
      when he hears the description of a battle in which he has taken part. And
      on the evenings when the officers, out on the spree with the setter—Lobytko—at
      their head, made Don Juan excursions to the “suburb,” and
      Ryabovitch took part in such excursions, he always was sad, felt
      profoundly guilty, and inwardly begged her forgiveness. . . . In
      hours of leisure or on sleepless nights, when he felt moved to recall his
      childhood, his father and mother— everything near and dear, in fact,
      he invariably thought of Myestetchki, the strange horse, Von Rabbek, his
      wife who was like the Empress Eugénie, the dark room, the crack of light
      at the door. . . .

 On the thirty-first of August he went back from the camp, not with the
      whole brigade, but with only two batteries of it. He was dreaming and
      excited all the way, as though he were going back to his native place. He
      had an intense longing to see again the strange horse, the church, the
      insincere family of the Von Rabbeks, the dark room. The “inner
      voice,” which so often deceives lovers, whispered to him for some
      reason that he would be sure to see her . . . and he was tortured by the
      questions, How he should meet her? What he would talk to her about?
      Whether she had forgotten the kiss? If the worst came to the worst, he
      thought, even if he did not meet her, it would be a pleasure to him merely
      to go through the dark room and recall the past. . . .

 Towards evening there appeared on the horizon the familiar church and
      white granaries. Ryabovitch’s heart beat. . . . He did not hear the
      officer who was riding beside him and saying something to him, he forgot
      everything, and looked eagerly at the river shining in the distance, at
      the roof of the house, at the dovecote round which the pigeons were
      circling in the light of the setting sun.

 When they reached the church and were listening to the billeting orders,
      he expected every second that a man on horseback would come round the
      church enclosure and invite the officers to tea, but . . . the billeting
      orders were read, the officers were in haste to go on to the village, and
      the man on horseback did not appear.

 “Von Rabbek will hear at once from the peasants that we have come
      and will send for us,” thought Ryabovitch, as he went into the hut,
      unable to understand why a comrade was lighting a candle and why the
      orderlies were hurriedly setting samovars. . . .

 A painful uneasiness took possession of him. He lay down, then got up and
      looked out of the window to see whether the messenger were coming. But
      there was no sign of him.

 He lay down again, but half an hour later he got up, and, unable to
      restrain his uneasiness, went into the street and strode towards the
      church. It was dark and deserted in the square near the church . . . .
      Three soldiers were standing silent in a row where the road began to go
      downhill. Seeing Ryabovitch, they roused themselves and saluted. He
      returned the salute and began to go down the familiar path.

 On the further side of the river the whole sky was flooded with crimson:
      the moon was rising; two peasant women, talking loudly, were picking
      cabbage in the kitchen garden; behind the kitchen garden there were some
      dark huts. . . . And everything on the near side of the river was just as
      it had been in May: the path, the bushes, the willows overhanging the
      water . . . but there was no sound of the brave nightingale, and no scent
      of poplar and fresh grass.

 Reaching the garden, Ryabovitch looked in at the gate. The garden was dark
      and still. . . . He could see nothing but the white stems of the nearest
      birch-trees and a little bit of the avenue; all the rest melted together
      into a dark blur. Ryabovitch looked and listened eagerly, but after
      waiting for a quarter of an hour without hearing a sound or catching a
      glimpse of a light, he trudged back. . . .

 He went down to the river. The General’s bath-house and the
      bath-sheets on the rail of the little bridge showed white before him. . .
      . He went on to the bridge, stood a little, and, quite unnecessarily,
      touched the sheets. They felt rough and cold. He looked down at the water.
      . . . The river ran rapidly and with a faintly audible gurgle round the
      piles of the bath-house. The red moon was reflected near the left bank;
      little ripples ran over the reflection, stretching it out, breaking it
      into bits, and seemed trying to carry it away.

 “How stupid, how stupid!” thought Ryabovitch, looking at the
      running water. “How unintelligent it all is!”

 Now that he expected nothing, the incident of the kiss, his impatience,
      his vague hopes and disappointment, presented themselves in a clear light.
      It no longer seemed to him strange that he had not seen the General’s
      messenger, and that he would never see the girl who had accidentally
      kissed him instead of some one else; on the contrary, it would have been
      strange if he had seen her. . . .

 The water was running, he knew not where or why, just as it did in May. In
      May it had flowed into the great river, from the great river into the sea;
      then it had risen in vapour, turned into rain, and perhaps the very same
      water was running now before Ryabovitch’s eyes again. . . . What
      for? Why?

 And the whole world, the whole of life, seemed to Ryabovitch an
      unintelligible, aimless jest. . . . And turning his eyes from the water
      and looking at the sky, he remembered again how fate in the person of an
      unknown woman had by chance caressed him, he remembered his summer dreams
      and fancies, and his life struck him as extraordinarily meagre,
      poverty-stricken, and colourless. . . .

 When he went back to his hut he did not find one of his comrades. The
      orderly informed him that they had all gone to “General von Rabbek’s,
      who had sent a messenger on horseback to invite them. . . .”

 For an instant there was a flash of joy in Ryabovitch’s heart, but
      he quenched it at once, got into bed, and in his wrath with his fate, as
      though to spite it, did not go to the General’s.
