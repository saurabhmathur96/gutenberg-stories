KASHTANKA

  (A Story) 

 I

 | Misbehaviour 

 A YOUNG dog, a reddish mongrel, between a dachshund and a “yard-dog,”
      very like a fox in face, was running up and down the pavement looking
      uneasily from side to side. From time to time she stopped and, whining and
      lifting first one chilled paw and then another, tried to make up her mind
      how it could have happened that she was lost.

 She remembered very well how she had passed the day, and how, in the end,
      she had found herself on this unfamiliar pavement.

 The day had begun by her master Luka Alexandritch’s putting on his
      hat, taking something wooden under his arm wrapped up in a red
      handkerchief, and calling: “Kashtanka, come along!”

 Hearing her name the mongrel had come out from under the work-table, where
      she slept on the shavings, stretched herself voluptuously and run after
      her master. The people Luka Alexandritch worked for lived a very long way
      off, so that, before he could get to any one of them, the carpenter had
      several times to step into a tavern to fortify himself. Kashtanka
      remembered that on the way she had behaved extremely improperly. In her
      delight that she was being taken for a walk she jumped about, dashed
      barking after the trains, ran into yards, and chased other dogs. The
      carpenter was continually losing sight of her, stopping, and angrily
      shouting at her. Once he had even, with an expression of fury in his face,
      taken her fox-like ear in his fist, smacked her, and said emphatically:
      “Pla-a-ague take you, you pest!”

 After having left the work where it had been bespoken, Luka Alexandritch
      went into his sister’s and there had something to eat and drink;
      from his sister’s he had gone to see a bookbinder he knew; from the
      bookbinder’s to a tavern, from the tavern to another crony’s,
      and so on. In short, by the time Kashtanka found herself on the unfamiliar
      pavement, it was getting dusk, and the carpenter was as drunk as a
      cobbler. He was waving his arms and, breathing heavily, muttered:

 “In sin my mother bore me! Ah, sins, sins! Here now we are walking
      along the street and looking at the street lamps, but when we die, we
      shall burn in a fiery Gehenna. . . .”

 Or he fell into a good-natured tone, called Kashtanka to him, and said to
      her: “You, Kashtanka, are an insect of a creature, and nothing else.
      Beside a man, you are much the same as a joiner beside a cabinet-maker. .
      . .”

 While he talked to her in that way, there was suddenly a burst of music.
      Kashtanka looked round and saw that a regiment of soldiers was coming
      straight towards her. Unable to endure the music, which unhinged her
      nerves, she turned round and round and wailed. To her great surprise, the
      carpenter, instead of being frightened, whining and barking, gave a broad
      grin, drew himself up to attention, and saluted with all his five fingers.
      Seeing that her master did not protest, Kashtanka whined louder than ever,
      and dashed across the road to the opposite pavement.

 When she recovered herself, the band was not playing and the regiment was
      no longer there. She ran across the road to the spot where she had left
      her master, but alas, the carpenter was no longer there. She dashed
      forward, then back again and ran across the road once more, but the
      carpenter seemed to have vanished into the earth. Kashtanka began sniffing
      the pavement, hoping to find her master by the scent of his tracks, but
      some wretch had been that way just before in new rubber goloshes, and now
      all delicate scents were mixed with an acute stench of india-rubber, so
      that it was impossible to make out anything.

 Kashtanka ran up and down and did not find her master, and meanwhile it
      had got dark. The street lamps were lighted on both sides of the road, and
      lights appeared in the windows. Big, fluffy snowflakes were falling and
      painting white the pavement, the horses’ backs and the cabmen’s
      caps, and the darker the evening grew the whiter were all these objects.
      Unknown customers kept walking incessantly to and fro, obstructing her
      field of vision and shoving against her with their feet. (All mankind
      Kashtanka divided into two uneven parts: masters and customers; between
      them there was an essential difference: the first had the right to beat
      her, and the second she had the right to nip by the calves of their legs.)
      These customers were hurrying off somewhere and paid no attention to her.

 When it got quite dark, Kashtanka was overcome by despair and horror. She
      huddled up in an entrance and began whining piteously. The long day’s
      journeying with Luka Alexandritch had exhausted her, her ears and her paws
      were freezing, and, what was more, she was terribly hungry. Only twice in
      the whole day had she tasted a morsel: she had eaten a little paste at the
      bookbinder’s, and in one of the taverns she had found a sausage skin
      on the floor, near the counter —that was all. If she had been a
      human being she would have certainly thought: “No, it is impossible
      to live like this! I must shoot myself!”

 II

 | A Mysterious Stranger 

 But she thought of nothing, she simply whined. When her head and back were
      entirely plastered over with the soft feathery snow, and she had sunk into
      a painful doze of exhaustion, all at once the door of the entrance
      clicked, creaked, and struck her on the side. She jumped up. A man
      belonging to the class of customers came out. As Kashtanka whined and got
      under his feet, he could not help noticing her. He bent down to her and
      asked:

 “Doggy, where do you come from? Have I hurt you? O, poor thing, poor
      thing. . . . Come, don’t be cross, don’t be cross. . . . I am
      sorry.”

 Kashtanka looked at the stranger through the snow-flakes that hung on her
      eyelashes, and saw before her a short, fat little man, with a plump,
      shaven face wearing a top hat and a fur coat that swung open.

 “What are you whining for?” he went on, knocking the snow off
      her back with his fingers. “Where is your master? I suppose you are
      lost? Ah, poor doggy! What are we going to do now?”

 Catching in the stranger’s voice a warm, cordial note, Kashtanka
      licked his hand, and whined still more pitifully.

 “Oh, you nice funny thing!” said the stranger. “A
      regular fox! Well, there’s nothing for it, you must come along with
      me! Perhaps you will be of use for something. . . . Well!”

 He clicked with his lips, and made a sign to Kashtanka with his hand,
      which could only mean one thing: “Come along!” Kashtanka went.

 Not more than half an hour later she was sitting on the floor in a big,
      light room, and, leaning her head against her side, was looking with
      tenderness and curiosity at the stranger who was sitting at the table,
      dining. He ate and threw pieces to her. . . . At first he gave her bread
      and the green rind of cheese, then a piece of meat, half a pie and chicken
      bones, while through hunger she ate so quickly that she had not time to
      distinguish the taste, and the more she ate the more acute was the feeling
      of hunger.

 “Your masters don’t feed you properly,” said the
      stranger, seeing with what ferocious greediness she swallowed the morsels
      without munching them. “And how thin you are! Nothing but skin and
      bones. . . .”

 Kashtanka ate a great deal and yet did not satisfy her hunger, but was
      simply stupefied with eating. After dinner she lay down in the middle of
      the room, stretched her legs and, conscious of an agreeable weariness all
      over her body, wagged her tail. While her new master, lounging in an
      easy-chair, smoked a cigar, she wagged her tail and considered the
      question, whether it was better at the stranger’s or at the
      carpenter’s. The stranger’s surroundings were poor and ugly;
      besides the easy-chairs, the sofa, the lamps and the rugs, there was
      nothing, and the room seemed empty. At the carpenter’s the whole
      place was stuffed full of things: he had a table, a bench, a heap of
      shavings, planes, chisels, saws, a cage with a goldfinch, a basin. . . .
      The stranger’s room smelt of nothing, while there was always a thick
      fog in the carpenter’s room, and a glorious smell of glue, varnish,
      and shavings. On the other hand, the stranger had one great superiority—he
      gave her a great deal to eat and, to do him full justice, when Kashtanka
      sat facing the table and looking wistfully at him, he did not once hit or
      kick her, and did not once shout: “Go away, damned brute!”

 When he had finished his cigar her new master went out, and a minute later
      came back holding a little mattress in his hands.

 “Hey, you dog, come here!” he said, laying the mattress in the
      corner near the dog. “Lie down here, go to sleep!”

 Then he put out the lamp and went away. Kashtanka lay down on the mattress
      and shut her eyes; the sound of a bark rose from the street, and she would
      have liked to answer it, but all at once she was overcome with unexpected
      melancholy. She thought of Luka Alexandritch, of his son Fedyushka, and
      her snug little place under the bench. . . . She remembered on the long
      winter evenings, when the carpenter was planing or reading the paper
      aloud, Fedyushka usually played with her. . . . He used to pull her from
      under the bench by her hind legs, and play such tricks with her, that she
      saw green before her eyes, and ached in every joint. He would make her
      walk on her hind legs, use her as a bell, that is, shake her violently by
      the tail so that she squealed and barked, and give her tobacco to sniff .
      . . . The following trick was particularly agonising: Fedyushka would tie
      a piece of meat to a thread and give it to Kashtanka, and then, when she
      had swallowed it he would, with a loud laugh, pull it back again from her
      stomach, and the more lurid were her memories the more loudly and
      miserably Kashtanka whined.

 But soon exhaustion and warmth prevailed over melancholy. She began to
      fall asleep. Dogs ran by in her imagination: among them a shaggy old
      poodle, whom she had seen that day in the street with a white patch on his
      eye and tufts of wool by his nose. Fedyushka ran after the poodle with a
      chisel in his hand, then all at once he too was covered with shaggy wool,
      and began merrily barking beside Kashtanka. Kashtanka and he goodnaturedly
      sniffed each other’s noses and merrily ran down the street. . . .

 III

 | New and Very Agreeable Acquaintances 

 When Kashtanka woke up it was already light, and a sound rose from the
      street, such as only comes in the day-time. There was not a soul in the
      room. Kashtanka stretched, yawned and, cross and ill-humoured, walked
      about the room. She sniffed the corners and the furniture, looked into the
      passage and found nothing of interest there. Besides the door that led
      into the passage there was another door. After thinking a little Kashtanka
      scratched on it with both paws, opened it, and went into the adjoining
      room. Here on the bed, covered with a rug, a customer, in whom she
      recognised the stranger of yesterday, lay asleep.

 “Rrrrr . . .” she growled, but recollecting yesterday’s
      dinner, wagged her tail, and began sniffing.

 She sniffed the stranger’s clothes and boots and thought they smelt
      of horses. In the bedroom was another door, also closed. Kashtanka
      scratched at the door, leaned her chest against it, opened it, and was
      instantly aware of a strange and very suspicious smell. Foreseeing an
      unpleasant encounter, growling and looking about her, Kashtanka walked
      into a little room with a dirty wall-paper and drew back in alarm. She saw
      something surprising and terrible. A grey gander came straight towards
      her, hissing, with its neck bowed down to the floor and its wings
      outspread. Not far from him, on a little mattress, lay a white tom-cat;
      seeing Kashtanka, he jumped up, arched his back, wagged his tail with his
      hair standing on end and he, too, hissed at her. The dog was frightened in
      earnest, but not caring to betray her alarm, began barking loudly and
      dashed at the cat . . . . The cat arched his back more than ever, mewed
      and gave Kashtanka a smack on the head with his paw. Kashtanka jumped
      back, squatted on all four paws, and craning her nose towards the cat,
      went off into loud, shrill barks; meanwhile the gander came up behind and
      gave her a painful peck in the back. Kashtanka leapt up and dashed at the
      gander.

 “What’s this?” They heard a loud angry voice, and the
      stranger came into the room in his dressing-gown, with a cigar between his
      teeth. “What’s the meaning of this? To your places!”

 He went up to the cat, flicked him on his arched back, and said:

 “Fyodor Timofeyitch, what’s the meaning of this? Have you got
      up a fight? Ah, you old rascal! Lie down!”

 And turning to the gander he shouted: “Ivan Ivanitch, go home!”

 The cat obediently lay down on his mattress and closed his eyes. Judging
      from the expression of his face and whiskers, he was displeased with
      himself for having lost his temper and got into a fight.

 Kashtanka began whining resentfully, while the gander craned his neck and
      began saying something rapidly, excitedly, distinctly, but quite
      unintelligibly.

 “All right, all right,” said his master, yawning. “You
      must live in peace and friendship.” He stroked Kashtanka and went
      on: “And you, redhair, don’t be frightened. . . . They are
      capital company, they won’t annoy you. Stay, what are we to call
      you? You can’t go on without a name, my dear.”

 The stranger thought a moment and said: “I tell you what . . . you
      shall be Auntie. . . . Do you understand? Auntie!”

 And repeating the word “Auntie” several times he went out.
      Kashtanka sat down and began watching. The cat sat motionless on his
      little mattress, and pretended to be asleep. The gander, craning his neck
      and stamping, went on talking rapidly and excitedly about something.
      Apparently it was a very clever gander; after every long tirade, he always
      stepped back with an air of wonder and made a show of being highly
      delighted with his own speech. . . . Listening to him and answering
      “R-r-r-r,” Kashtanka fell to sniffing the corners. In one of
      the corners she found a little trough in which she saw some soaked peas
      and a sop of rye crusts. She tried the peas; they were not nice; she tried
      the sopped bread and began eating it. The gander was not at all offended
      that the strange dog was eating his food, but, on the contrary, talked
      even more excitedly, and to show his confidence went to the trough and ate
      a few peas himself.

 IV

 | Marvels on a Hurdle 

 A little while afterwards the stranger came in again, and brought a
      strange thing with him like a hurdle, or like the figure II. On the
      crosspiece on the top of this roughly made wooden frame hung a bell, and a
      pistol was also tied to it; there were strings from the tongue of the
      bell, and the trigger of the pistol. The stranger put the frame in the
      middle of the room, spent a long time tying and untying something, then
      looked at the gander and said: “Ivan Ivanitch, if you please!”

 The gander went up to him and stood in an expectant attitude.

 “Now then,” said the stranger, “let us begin at the very
      beginning. First of all, bow and make a curtsey! Look sharp!”

 Ivan Ivanitch craned his neck, nodded in all directions, and scraped with
      his foot.

 “Right. Bravo. . . . Now die!”

 The gander lay on his back and stuck his legs in the air. After performing
      a few more similar, unimportant tricks, the stranger suddenly clutched at
      his head, and assuming an expression of horror, shouted: “Help!
      Fire! We are burning!”

 Ivan Ivanitch ran to the frame, took the string in his beak, and set the
      bell ringing.

 The stranger was very much pleased. He stroked the gander’s neck and
      said:

 “Bravo, Ivan Ivanitch! Now pretend that you are a jeweller selling
      gold and diamonds. Imagine now that you go to your shop and find thieves
      there. What would you do in that case?”

 The gander took the other string in his beak and pulled it, and at once a
      deafening report was heard. Kashtanka was highly delighted with the bell
      ringing, and the shot threw her into so much ecstasy that she ran round
      the frame barking.

 “Auntie, lie down!” cried the stranger; “be quiet!”

 Ivan Ivanitch’s task was not ended with the shooting. For a whole
      hour afterwards the stranger drove the gander round him on a cord,
      cracking a whip, and the gander had to jump over barriers and through
      hoops; he had to rear, that is, sit on his tail and wave his legs in the
      air. Kashtanka could not take her eyes off Ivan Ivanitch, wriggled with
      delight, and several times fell to running after him with shrill barks.
      After exhausting the gander and himself, the stranger wiped the sweat from
      his brow and cried:

 “Marya, fetch Havronya Ivanovna here!”

 A minute later there was the sound of grunting. Kashtanka growled, assumed
      a very valiant air, and to be on the safe side, went nearer to the
      stranger. The door opened, an old woman looked in, and, saying something,
      led in a black and very ugly sow. Paying no attention to Kashtanka’s
      growls, the sow lifted up her little hoof and grunted good-humouredly.
      Apparently it was very agreeable to her to see her master, the cat, and
      Ivan Ivanitch. When she went up to the cat and gave him a light tap on the
      stomach with her hoof, and then made some remark to the gander, a great
      deal of good-nature was expressed in her movements, and the quivering of
      her tail. Kashtanka realised at once that to growl and bark at such a
      character was useless.

 The master took away the frame and cried. “Fyodor Timofeyitch, if
      you please!”

 The cat stretched lazily, and reluctantly, as though performing a duty,
      went up to the sow.

 “Come, let us begin with the Egyptian pyramid,” began the
      master.

 He spent a long time explaining something, then gave the word of command,
      “One . . . two . . . three!” At the word “three”
      Ivan Ivanitch flapped his wings and jumped on to the sow’s back. . .
      . When, balancing himself with his wings and his neck, he got a firm
      foothold on the bristly back, Fyodor Timofeyitch listlessly and lazily,
      with manifest disdain, and with an air of scorning his art and not caring
      a pin for it, climbed on to the sow’s back, then reluctantly mounted
      on to the gander, and stood on his hind legs. The result was what the
      stranger called the Egyptian pyramid. Kashtanka yapped with delight, but
      at that moment the old cat yawned and, losing his balance, rolled off the
      gander. Ivan Ivanitch lurched and fell off too. The stranger shouted,
      waved his hands, and began explaining something again. After spending an
      hour over the pyramid their indefatigable master proceeded to teach Ivan
      Ivanitch to ride on the cat, then began to teach the cat to smoke, and so
      on.

 The lesson ended in the stranger’s wiping the sweat off his brow and
      going away. Fyodor Timofeyitch gave a disdainful sniff, lay down on his
      mattress, and closed his eyes; Ivan Ivanitch went to the trough, and the
      pig was taken away by the old woman. Thanks to the number of her new
      impressions, Kashranka hardly noticed how the day passed, and in the
      evening she was installed with her mattress in the room with the dirty
      wall-paper, and spent the night in the society of Fyodor Timofeyitch and
      the gander.

 V

 | Talent! Talent! 

 A month passed.

 Kashtanka had grown used to having a nice dinner every evening, and being
      called Auntie. She had grown used to the stranger too, and to her new
      companions. Life was comfortable and easy.

 Every day began in the same way. As a rule, Ivan Ivanitch was the first to
      wake up, and at once went up to Auntie or to the cat, twisting his neck,
      and beginning to talk excitedly and persuasively, but, as before,
      unintelligibly. Sometimes he would crane up his head in the air and utter
      a long monologue. At first Kashtanka thought he talked so much because he
      was very clever, but after a little time had passed, she lost all her
      respect for him; when he went up to her with his long speeches she no
      longer wagged her tail, but treated him as a tiresome chatterbox, who
      would not let anyone sleep and, without the slightest ceremony, answered
      him with “R-r-r-r!”

 Fyodor Timofeyitch was a gentleman of a very different sort. When he woke
      he did not utter a sound, did not stir, and did not even open his eyes. He
      would have been glad not to wake, for, as was evident, he was not greatly
      in love with life. Nothing interested him, he showed an apathetic and
      nonchalant attitude to everything, he disdained everything and, even while
      eating his delicious dinner, sniffed contemptuously.

 When she woke Kashtanka began walking about the room and sniffing the
      corners. She and the cat were the only ones allowed to go all over the
      flat; the gander had not the right to cross the threshold of the room with
      the dirty wall-paper, and Hayronya Ivanovna lived somewhere in a little
      outhouse in the yard and made her appearance only during the lessons.
      Their master got up late, and immediately after drinking his tea began
      teaching them their tricks. Every day the frame, the whip, and the hoop
      were brought in, and every day almost the same performance took place. The
      lesson lasted three or four hours, so that sometimes Fyodor Timofeyitch
      was so tired that he staggered about like a drunken man, and Ivan Ivanitch
      opened his beak and breathed heavily, while their master became red in the
      face and could not mop the sweat from his brow fast enough.

 The lesson and the dinner made the day very interesting, but the evenings
      were tedious. As a rule, their master went off somewhere in the evening
      and took the cat and the gander with him. Left alone, Auntie lay down on
      her little mattress and began to feel sad.

 Melancholy crept on her imperceptibly and took possession of her by
      degrees, as darkness does of a room. It began with the dog’s losing
      every inclination to bark, to eat, to run about the rooms, and even to
      look at things; then vague figures, half dogs, half human beings, with
      countenances attractive, pleasant, but incomprehensible, would appear in
      her imagination; when they came Auntie wagged her tail, and it seemed to
      her that she had somewhere, at some time, seen them and loved them. And as
      she dropped asleep, she always felt that those figures smelt of glue,
      shavings, and varnish.

 When she had grown quite used to her new life, and from a thin, long
      mongrel, had changed into a sleek, well-groomed dog, her master looked at
      her one day before the lesson and said:

 “It’s high time, Auntie, to get to business. You have kicked
      up your heels in idleness long enough. I want to make an artiste of you. .
      . . Do you want to be an artiste?”

 And he began teaching her various accomplishments. At the first lesson he
      taught her to stand and walk on her hind legs, which she liked extremely.
      At the second lesson she had to jump on her hind legs and catch some
      sugar, which her teacher held high above her head. After that, in the
      following lessons she danced, ran tied to a cord, howled to music, rang
      the bell, and fired the pistol, and in a month could successfully replace
      Fyodor Timofeyitch in the “Egyptian Pyramid.” She learned very
      eagerly and was pleased with her own success; running with her tongue out
      on the cord, leaping through the hoop, and riding on old Fyodor
      Timofeyitch, gave her the greatest enjoyment. She accompanied every
      successful trick with a shrill, delighted bark, while her teacher
      wondered, was also delighted, and rubbed his hands.

 “It’s talent! It’s talent!” he said. “Unquestionable
      talent! You will certainly be successful!”

 And Auntie grew so used to the word talent, that every time her master
      pronounced it, she jumped up as if it had been her name.

 VI

 | An Uneasy Night 

 Auntie had a doggy dream that a porter ran after her with a broom, and she
      woke up in a fright.

 It was quite dark and very stuffy in the room. The fleas were biting.
      Auntie had never been afraid of darkness before, but now, for some reason,
      she felt frightened and inclined to bark.

 Her master heaved a loud sigh in the next room, then soon afterwards the
      sow grunted in her sty, and then all was still again. When one thinks
      about eating one’s heart grows lighter, and Auntie began thinking
      how that day she had stolen the leg of a chicken from Fyodor Timofeyitch,
      and had hidden it in the drawing-room, between the cupboard and the wall,
      where there were a great many spiders’ webs and a great deal of
      dust. Would it not be as well to go now and look whether the chicken leg
      were still there or not? It was very possible that her master had found it
      and eaten it. But she must not go out of the room before morning, that was
      the rule. Auntie shut her eyes to go to sleep as quickly as possible, for
      she knew by experience that the sooner you go to sleep the sooner the
      morning comes. But all at once there was a strange scream not far from her
      which made her start and jump up on all four legs. It was Ivan Ivanitch,
      and his cry was not babbling and persuasive as usual, but a wild, shrill,
      unnatural scream like the squeak of a door opening. Unable to distinguish
      anything in the darkness, and not understanding what was wrong, Auntie
      felt still more frightened and growled: “R-r-r-r. . . .”

 Some time passed, as long as it takes to eat a good bone; the scream was
      not repeated. Little by little Auntie’s uneasiness passed off and
      she began to doze. She dreamed of two big black dogs with tufts of last
      year’s coat left on their haunches and sides; they were eating out
      of a big basin some swill, from which there came a white steam and a most
      appetising smell; from time to time they looked round at Auntie, showed
      their teeth and growled: “We are not going to give you any!”
      But a peasant in a fur-coat ran out of the house and drove them away with
      a whip; then Auntie went up to the basin and began eating, but as soon as
      the peasant went out of the gate, the two black dogs rushed at her
      growling, and all at once there was again a shrill scream.

 “K-gee! K-gee-gee!” cried Ivan Ivanitch.

 Auntie woke, jumped up and, without leaving her mattress, went off into a
      yelping bark. It seemed to her that it was not Ivan Ivanitch that was
      screaming but someone else, and for some reason the sow again grunted in
      her sty.

 Then there was the sound of shuffling slippers, and the master came into
      the room in his dressing-gown with a candle in his hand. The flickering
      light danced over the dirty wall-paper and the ceiling, and chased away
      the darkness. Auntie saw that there was no stranger in the room. Ivan
      Ivanitch was sitting on the floor and was not asleep. His wings were
      spread out and his beak was open, and altogether he looked as though he
      were very tired and thirsty. Old Fyodor Timofeyitch was not asleep either.
      He, too, must have been awakened by the scream.

 “Ivan Ivanitch, what’s the matter with you?” the master
      asked the gander. “Why are you screaming? Are you ill?”

 The gander did not answer. The master touched him on the neck, stroked his
      back, and said: “You are a queer chap. You don’t sleep
      yourself, and you don’t let other people. . . .”

 When the master went out, carrying the candle with him, there was darkness
      again. Auntie felt frightened. The gander did not scream, but again she
      fancied that there was some stranger in the room. What was most dreadful
      was that this stranger could not be bitten, as he was unseen and had no
      shape. And for some reason she thought that something very bad would
      certainly happen that night. Fyodor Timofeyitch was uneasy too.

 Auntie could hear him shifting on his mattress, yawning and shaking his
      head.

 Somewhere in the street there was a knocking at a gate and the sow grunted
      in her sty. Auntie began to whine, stretched out her front-paws and laid
      her head down upon them. She fancied that in the knocking at the gate, in
      the grunting of the sow, who was for some reason awake, in the darkness
      and the stillness, there was something as miserable and dreadful as in
      Ivan Ivanitch’s scream. Everything was in agitation and anxiety, but
      why? Who was the stranger who could not be seen? Then two dim flashes of
      green gleamed for a minute near Auntie. It was Fyodor Timofeyitch, for the
      first time of their whole acquaintance coming up to her. What did he want?
      Auntie licked his paw, and not asking why he had come, howled softly and
      on various notes.

 “K-gee!” cried Ivan Ivanitch, “K-g-ee!”

 The door opened again and the master came in with a candle.

 The gander was sitting in the same attitude as before, with his beak open,
      and his wings spread out, his eyes were closed.

 “Ivan Ivanitch!” his master called him.

 The gander did not stir. His master sat down before him on the floor,
      looked at him in silence for a minute, and said:

 “Ivan Ivanitch, what is it? Are you dying? Oh, I remember now, I
      remember!” he cried out, and clutched at his head. “I know why
      it is! It’s because the horse stepped on you to-day! My God! My God!”

 Auntie did not understand what her master was saying, but she saw from his
      face that he, too, was expecting something dreadful. She stretched out her
      head towards the dark window, where it seemed to her some stranger was
      looking in, and howled.

 “He is dying, Auntie!” said her master, and wrung his hands.
      “Yes, yes, he is dying! Death has come into your room. What are we
      to do?”

 Pale and agitated, the master went back into his room, sighing and shaking
      his head. Auntie was afraid to remain in the darkness, and followed her
      master into his bedroom. He sat down on the bed and repeated several
      times: “My God, what’s to be done?”

 Auntie walked about round his feet, and not understanding why she was
      wretched and why they were all so uneasy, and trying to understand,
      watched every movement he made. Fyodor Timofeyitch, who rarely left his
      little mattress, came into the master’s bedroom too, and began
      rubbing himself against his feet. He shook his head as though he wanted to
      shake painful thoughts out of it, and kept peeping suspiciously under the
      bed.

 The master took a saucer, poured some water from his wash-stand into it,
      and went to the gander again.

 “Drink, Ivan Ivanitch!” he said tenderly, setting the saucer
      before him; “drink, darling.”

 But Ivan Ivanitch did not stir and did not open his eyes. His master bent
      his head down to the saucer and dipped his beak into the water, but the
      gander did not drink, he spread his wings wider than ever, and his head
      remained lying in the saucer.

 “No, there’s nothing to be done now,” sighed his master.
      “It’s all over. Ivan Ivanitch is gone!”

 And shining drops, such as one sees on the window-pane when it rains,
      trickled down his cheeks. Not understanding what was the matter, Auntie
      and Fyodor Timofeyitch snuggled up to him and looked with horror at the
      gander.

 “Poor Ivan Ivanitch!” said the master, sighing mournfully.
      “And I was dreaming I would take you in the spring into the country,
      and would walk with you on the green grass. Dear creature, my good
      comrade, you are no more! How shall I do without you now?”

 It seemed to Auntie that the same thing would happen to her, that is, that
      she too, there was no knowing why, would close her eyes, stretch out her
      paws, open her mouth, and everyone would look at her with horror.
      Apparently the same reflections were passing through the brain of Fyodor
      Timofeyitch. Never before had the old cat been so morose and gloomy.

 It began to get light, and the unseen stranger who had so frightened
      Auntie was no longer in the room. When it was quite daylight, the porter
      came in, took the gander, and carried him away. And soon afterwards the
      old woman came in and took away the trough.

 Auntie went into the drawing-room and looked behind the cupboard: her
      master had not eaten the chicken bone, it was lying in its place among the
      dust and spiders’ webs. But Auntie felt sad and dreary and wanted to
      cry. She did not even sniff at the bone, but went under the sofa, sat down
      there, and began softly whining in a thin voice.

 VII

 | An Unsuccessful Début 

 One fine evening the master came into the room with the dirty wall-paper,
      and, rubbing his hands, said:

 “Well. . . .”

 He meant to say something more, but went away without saying it. Auntie,
      who during her lessons had thoroughly studied his face and intonations,
      divined that he was agitated, anxious and, she fancied, angry. Soon
      afterwards he came back and said:

 “To-day I shall take with me Auntie and F’yodor Timofeyitch.
      To-day, Auntie, you will take the place of poor Ivan Ivanitch in the
      ‘Egyptian Pyramid.’ Goodness knows how it will be! Nothing is
      ready, nothing has been thoroughly studied, there have been few
      rehearsals! We shall be disgraced, we shall come to grief!”

 Then he went out again, and a minute later, came back in his fur-coat and
      top hat. Going up to the cat he took him by the fore-paws and put him
      inside the front of his coat, while Fyodor Timofeyitch appeared completely
      unconcerned, and did not even trouble to open his eyes. To him it was
      apparently a matter of absolute indifference whether he remained lying
      down, or were lifted up by his paws, whether he rested on his mattress or
      under his master’s fur-coat.

 “Come along, Auntie,” said her master.

 Wagging her tail, and understanding nothing, Auntie followed him. A minute
      later she was sitting in a sledge by her master’s feet and heard
      him, shrinking with cold and anxiety, mutter to himself:

 “We shall be disgraced! We shall come to grief!”

 The sledge stopped at a big strange-looking house, like a soup-ladle
      turned upside down. The long entrance to this house, with its three glass
      doors, was lighted up with a dozen brilliant lamps. The doors opened with
      a resounding noise and, like jaws, swallowed up the people who were moving
      to and fro at the entrance. There were a great many people, horses, too,
      often ran up to the entrance, but no dogs were to be seen.

 The master took Auntie in his arms and thrust her in his coat, where
      Fyodor Timofeyirch already was. It was dark and stuffy there, but warm.
      For an instant two green sparks flashed at her; it was the cat, who opened
      his eyes on being disturbed by his neighbour’s cold rough paws.
      Auntie licked his ear, and, trying to settle herself as comfortably as
      possible, moved uneasily, crushed him under her cold paws, and casually
      poked her head out from under the coat, but at once growled angrily, and
      tucked it in again. It seemed to her that she had seen a huge, badly
      lighted room, full of monsters; from behind screens and gratings, which
      stretched on both sides of the room, horrible faces looked out: faces of
      horses with horns, with long ears, and one fat, huge countenance with a
      tail instead of a nose, and two long gnawed bones sticking out of his
      mouth.

 The cat mewed huskily under Auntie’s paws, but at that moment the
      coat was flung open, the master said, “Hop!” and Fyodor
      Timofeyitch and Auntie jumped to the floor. They were now in a little room
      with grey plank walls; there was no other furniture in it but a little
      table with a looking-glass on it, a stool, and some rags hung about the
      corners, and instead of a lamp or candles, there was a bright fan-shaped
      light attached to a little pipe fixed in the wall. Fyodor Timofeyitch
      licked his coat which had been ruffled by Auntie, went under the stool,
      and lay down. Their master, still agitated and rubbing his hands, began
      undressing. . . . He undressed as he usually did at home when he was
      preparing to get under the rug, that is, took off everything but his
      underlinen, then he sat down on the stool, and, looking in the
      looking-glass, began playing the most surprising tricks with himself. . .
      . First of all he put on his head a wig, with a parting and with two tufts
      of hair standing up like horns, then he smeared his face thickly with
      something white, and over the white colour painted his eyebrows, his
      moustaches, and red on his cheeks. His antics did not end with that. After
      smearing his face and neck, he began putting himself into an extraordinary
      and incongruous costume, such as Auntie had never seen before, either in
      houses or in the street. Imagine very full trousers, made of chintz
      covered with big flowers, such as is used in working-class houses for
      curtains and covering furniture, trousers which buttoned up just under his
      armpits. One trouser leg was made of brown chintz, the other of bright
      yellow. Almost lost in these, he then put on a short chintz jacket, with a
      big scalloped collar, and a gold star on the back, stockings of different
      colours, and green slippers.

 Everything seemed going round before Auntie’s eyes and in her soul.
      The white-faced, sack-like figure smelt like her master, its voice, too,
      was the familiar master’s voice, but there were moments when Auntie
      was tortured by doubts, and then she was ready to run away from the
      parti-coloured figure and to bark. The new place, the fan-shaped light,
      the smell, the transformation that had taken place in her master—all
      this aroused in her a vague dread and a foreboding that she would
      certainly meet with some horror such as the big face with the tail instead
      of a nose. And then, somewhere through the wall, some hateful band was
      playing, and from time to time she heard an incomprehensible roar. Only
      one thing reassured her—that was the imperturbability of Fyodor
      Timofeyitch. He dozed with the utmost tranquillity under the stool, and
      did not open his eyes even when it was moved.

 A man in a dress coat and a white waistcoat peeped into the little room
      and said:

 “Miss Arabella has just gone on. After her—you.”

 Their master made no answer. He drew a small box from under the table, sat
      down, and waited. From his lips and his hands it could be seen that he was
      agitated, and Auntie could hear how his breathing came in gasps.

 “Monsieur George, come on!” someone shouted behind the door.
      Their master got up and crossed himself three times, then took the cat
      from under the stool and put him in the box.

 “Come, Auntie,” he said softly.

 Auntie, who could make nothing out of it, went up to his hands, he kissed
      her on the head, and put her beside Fyodor Timofeyitch. Then followed
      darkness. . . . Auntie trampled on the cat, scratched at the walls of the
      box, and was so frightened that she could not utter a sound, while the box
      swayed and quivered, as though it were on the waves. . . .

 “Here we are again!” her master shouted aloud: “here we
      are again!”

 Auntie felt that after that shout the box struck against something hard
      and left off swaying. There was a loud deep roar, someone was being
      slapped, and that someone, probably the monster with the tail instead of a
      nose, roared and laughed so loud that the locks of the box trembled. In
      response to the roar, there came a shrill, squeaky laugh from her master,
      such as he never laughed at home.

 “Ha!” he shouted, trying to shout above the roar. “Honoured
      friends! I have only just come from the station! My granny’s kicked
      the bucket and left me a fortune! There is something very heavy in the
      box, it must be gold, ha! ha! I bet there’s a million here! We’ll
      open it and look. . . .”

 The lock of the box clicked. The bright light dazzled Auntie’s eyes,
      she jumped out of the box, and, deafened by the roar, ran quickly round
      her master, and broke into a shrill bark.

 “Ha!” exclaimed her master. “Uncle Fyodor Timofeyitch!
      Beloved Aunt, dear relations! The devil take you!”

 He fell on his stomach on the sand, seized the cat and Auntie, and fell to
      embracing them. While he held Auntie tight in his arms, she glanced round
      into the world into which fate had brought her and, impressed by its
      immensity, was for a minute dumbfounded with amazement and delight, then
      jumped out of her master’s arms, and to express the intensity of her
      emotions, whirled round and round on one spot like a top. This new world
      was big and full of bright light; wherever she looked, on all sides, from
      floor to ceiling there were faces, faces, faces, and nothing else.

 “Auntie, I beg you to sit down!” shouted her master.
      Remembering what that meant, Auntie jumped on to a chair, and sat down.
      She looked at her master. His eyes looked at her gravely and kindly as
      always, but his face, especially his mouth and teeth, were made grotesque
      by a broad immovable grin. He laughed, skipped about, twitched his
      shoulders, and made a show of being very merry in the presence of the
      thousands of faces. Auntie believed in his merriment, all at once felt all
      over her that those thousands of faces were looking at her, lifted up her
      fox-like head, and howled joyously.

 “You sit there, Auntie,” her master said to her, “while
      Uncle and I will dance the Kamarinsky.”

 Fyodor Timofeyitch stood looking about him indifferently, waiting to be
      made to do something silly. He danced listlessly, carelessly, sullenly,
      and one could see from his movements, his tail and his ears, that he had a
      profound contempt for the crowd, the bright light, his master and himself.
      When he had performed his allotted task, he gave a yawn and sat down.

 “Now, Auntie!” said her master, “we’ll have first
      a song, and then a dance, shall we?”

 He took a pipe out of his pocket, and began playing. Auntie, who could not
      endure music, began moving uneasily in her chair and howled. A roar of
      applause rose from all sides. Her master bowed, and when all was still
      again, went on playing. . . . Just as he took one very high note, someone
      high up among the audience uttered a loud exclamation:

 “Auntie!” cried a child’s voice, “why it’s
      Kashtanka!”

 “Kashtanka it is!” declared a cracked drunken tenor. “Kashtanka!
      Strike me dead, Fedyushka, it is Kashtanka. Kashtanka! here!”

 Someone in the gallery gave a whistle, and two voices, one a boy’s
      and one a man’s, called loudly: “Kashtanka! Kashtanka!”

 Auntie started, and looked where the shouting came from. Two faces, one
      hairy, drunken and grinning, the other chubby, rosy-cheeked and
      frightened-looking, dazed her eyes as the bright light had dazed them
      before. . . . She remembered, fell off the chair, struggled on the sand,
      then jumped up, and with a delighted yap dashed towards those faces. There
      was a deafening roar, interspersed with whistles and a shrill childish
      shout: “Kashtanka! Kashtanka!”

 Auntie leaped over the barrier, then across someone’s shoulders. She
      found herself in a box: to get into the next tier she had to leap over a
      high wall. Auntie jumped, but did not jump high enough, and slipped back
      down the wall. Then she was passed from hand to hand, licked hands and
      faces, kept mounting higher and higher, and at last got into the gallery.
      . . .

 ——

 Half an hour afterwards, Kashtanka was in the street, following the people
      who smelt of glue and varnish. Luka Alexandritch staggered and
      instinctively, taught by experience, tried to keep as far from the gutter
      as possible.

 “In sin my mother bore me,” he muttered. “And you,
      Kashtanka, are a thing of little understanding. Beside a man, you are like
      a joiner beside a cabinetmaker.”

 Fedyushka walked beside him, wearing his father’s cap. Kashtanka
      looked at their backs, and it seemed to her that she had been following
      them for ages, and was glad that there had not been a break for a minute
      in her life.

 She remembered the little room with dirty wall-paper, the gander, Fyodor
      Timofeyitch, the delicious dinners, the lessons, the circus, but all that
      seemed to her now like a long, tangled, oppressive dream.
