THE SHOEMAKER AND THE DEVIL

  I

T was Christmas
      Eve. Marya had long been snoring on the stove; all the paraffin in the
      little lamp had burnt out, but Fyodor Nilov still sat at work. He would
      long ago have flung aside his work and gone out into the street, but a
      customer from Kolokolny Lane, who had a fortnight before ordered some
      boots, had been in the previous day, had abused him roundly, and had
      ordered him to finish the boots at once before the morning service.

 “It’s a convict’s life!” Fyodor grumbled as he
      worked. “Some people have been asleep long ago, others are enjoying
      themselves, while you sit here like some Cain and sew for the devil knows
      whom....”

 To save himself from accidentally falling asleep, he kept taking a bottle
      from under the table and drinking out of it, and after every pull at it he
      twisted his head and said aloud:

 “What is the reason, kindly tell me, that customers enjoy themselves
      while I am forced to sit and work for them? Because they have money and I
      am a beggar?”

 He hated all his customers, especially the one who lived in Kolokolny
      Lane. He was a gentleman of gloomy appearance, with long hair, a yellow
      face, blue spectacles, and a husky voice. He had a German name which one
      could not pronounce. It was impossible to tell what was his calling and
      what he did. When, a fortnight before, Fyodor had gone to take his
      measure, he, the customer, was sitting on the floor pounding something in
      a mortar. Before Fyodor had time to say good-morning the contents of the
      mortar suddenly flared up and burned with a bright red flame; there was a
      stink of sulphur and burnt feathers, and the room was filled with a thick
      pink smoke, so that Fyodor sneezed five times; and as he returned home
      afterwards, he thought: “Anyone who feared God would not have
      anything to do with things like that.”

 When there was nothing left in the bottle Fyodor put the boots on the
      table and sank into thought. He leaned his heavy head on his fist and
      began thinking of his poverty, of his hard life with no glimmer of light
      in it. Then he thought of the rich, of their big houses and their
      carriages, of their hundred-rouble notes.... How nice it would be if the
      houses of these rich men—the devil flay them!—were smashed, if
      their horses died, if their fur coats and sable caps got shabby! How
      splendid it would be if the rich, little by little, changed into beggars
      having nothing, and he, a poor shoemaker, were to become rich, and were to
      lord it over some other poor shoemaker on Christmas Eve.

 Dreaming like this, Fyodor suddenly thought of his work, and opened his
      eyes.

 “Here’s a go,” he thought, looking at the boots. “The
      job has been finished ever so long ago, and I go on sitting here. I must
      take the boots to the gentleman.”

 He wrapped up the work in a red handkerchief, put on his things, and went
      out into the street. A fine hard snow was falling, pricking the face as
      though with needles. It was cold, slippery, dark, the gas-lamps burned
      dimly, and for some reason there was a smell of paraffin in the street, so
      that Fyodor coughed and cleared his throat. Rich men were driving to and
      fro on the road, and every rich man had a ham and a bottle of vodka in his
      hands. Rich young ladies peeped at Fyodor out of the carriages and
      sledges, put out their tongues and shouted, laughing:

 “Beggar! Beggar!”

 Students, officers, and merchants walked behind Fyodor, jeering at him and
      crying:

 “Drunkard! Drunkard! Infidel cobbler! Soul of a boot-leg! Beggar!”

 All this was insulting, but Fyodor held his tongue and only spat in
      disgust. But when Kuzma Lebyodkin from Warsaw, a master-bootmaker, met him
      and said: “I’ve married a rich woman and I have men working
      under me, while you are a beggar and have nothing to eat,” Fyodor
      could not refrain from running after him. He pursued him till he found
      himself in Kolokolny Lane. His customer lived in the fourth house from the
      corner on the very top floor. To reach him one had to go through a long,
      dark courtyard, and then to climb up a very high slippery stair-case which
      tottered under one’s feet. When Fyodor went in to him he was sitting
      on the floor pounding something in a mortar, just as he had been the
      fortnight before.

 “Your honor, I have brought your boots,” said Fyodor sullenly.

 The customer got up and began trying on the boots in silence. Desiring to
      help him, Fyodor went down on one knee and pulled off his old, boot, but
      at once jumped up and staggered towards the door in horror. The customer
      had not a foot, but a hoof like a horse’s.

 “Aha!” thought Fyodor; “here’s a go!”

 The first thing should have been to cross himself, then to leave
      everything and run downstairs; but he immediately reflected that he was
      meeting a devil for the first and probably the last time, and not to take
      advantage of his services would be foolish. He controlled himself and
      determined to try his luck. Clasping his hands behind him to avoid making
      the sign of the cross, he coughed respectfully and began:

 “They say that there is nothing on earth more evil and impure than
      the devil, but I am of the opinion, your honor, that the devil is highly
      educated. He has—excuse my saying it—hoofs and a tail behind,
      but he has more brains than many a student.”

 “I like you for what you say,” said the devil, flattered.
      “Thank you, shoemaker! What do you want?”

 And without loss of time the shoemaker began complaining of his lot. He
      began by saying that from his childhood up he had envied the rich. He had
      always resented it that all people did not live alike in big houses and
      drive with good horses. Why, he asked, was he poor? How was he worse than
      Kuzma Lebyodkin from Warsaw, who had his own house, and whose wife wore a
      hat? He had the same sort of nose, the same hands, feet, head, and back,
      as the rich, and so why was he forced to work when others were enjoying
      themselves? Why was he married to Marya and not to a lady smelling of
      scent? He had often seen beautiful young ladies in the houses of rich
      customers, but they either took no notice of him whatever, or else
      sometimes laughed and whispered to each other: “What a red nose that
      shoemaker has!” It was true that Marya was a good, kind,
      hard-working woman, but she was not educated; her hand was heavy and hit
      hard, and if one had occasion to speak of politics or anything
      intellectual before her, she would put her spoke in and talk the most
      awful nonsense.

 “What do you want, then?” his customer interrupted him.

 “I beg you, your honor Satan Ivanitch, to be graciously pleased to
      make me a rich man.”

 “Certainly. Only for that you must give me up your soul! Before the
      cocks crow, go and sign on this paper here that you give me up your soul.”

 “Your honor,” said Fyodor politely, “when you ordered a
      pair of boots from me I did not ask for the money in advance. One has
      first to carry out the order and then ask for payment.”

 “Oh, very well!” the customer assented.

 A bright flame suddenly flared up in the mortar, a pink thick smoke came
      puffing out, and there was a smell of burnt feathers and sulphur. When the
      smoke had subsided, Fyodor rubbed his eyes and saw that he was no longer
      Fyodor, no longer a shoemaker, but quite a different man, wearing a
      waistcoat and a watch-chain, in a new pair of trousers, and that he was
      sitting in an armchair at a big table. Two foot men were handing him
      dishes, bowing low and saying:

 “Kindly eat, your honor, and may it do you good!”

 What wealth! The footmen handed him a big piece of roast mutton and a dish
      of cucumbers, and then brought in a frying-pan a roast goose, and a little
      afterwards boiled pork with horse-radish cream. And how dignified, how
      genteel it all was! Fyodor ate, and before each dish drank a big glass of
      excellent vodka, like some general or some count. After the pork he was
      handed some boiled grain moistened with goose fat, then an omelette with
      bacon fat, then fried liver, and he went on eating and was delighted. What
      more? They served, too, a pie with onion and steamed turnip with kvass.

 “How is it the gentry don’t burst with such meals?” he
      thought.

 In conclusion they handed him a big pot of honey. After dinner the devil
      appeared in blue spectacles and asked with a low bow:

 “Are you satisfied with your dinner, Fyodor Pantelyeitch?”

 But Fyodor could not answer one word, he was so stuffed after his dinner.
      The feeling of repletion was unpleasant, oppressive, and to distract his
      thoughts he looked at the boot on his left foot.

 “For a boot like that I used not to take less than seven and a half
      roubles. What shoemaker made it?” he asked.

 “Kuzma Lebyodkin,” answered the footman.

 “Send for him, the fool!”

 Kuzma Lebyodkin from Warsaw soon made his appearance. He stopped in a
      respectful attitude at the door and asked:

 “What are your orders, your honor?”

 “Hold your tongue!” cried Fyodor, and stamped his foot.
      “Don’t dare to argue; remember your place as a cobbler!
      Blockhead! You don’t know how to make boots! I’ll beat your
      ugly phiz to a jelly! Why have you come?”

 “For money.”

 “What money? Be off! Come on Saturday! Boy, give him a cuff!”

 But he at once recalled what a life the customers used to lead him, too,
      and he felt heavy at heart, and to distract his attention he took a fat
      pocketbook out of his pocket and began counting his money. There was a
      great deal of money, but Fyodor wanted more still. The devil in the blue
      spectacles brought him another notebook fatter still, but he wanted even
      more; and the more he counted it, the more discontented he became.

 In the evening the evil one brought him a full-bosomed lady in a red
      dress, and said that this was his new wife. He spent the whole evening
      kissing her and eating gingerbreads, and at night he went to bed on a
      soft, downy feather-bed, turned from side to side, and could not go to
      sleep. He felt uncanny.

 “We have a great deal of money,” he said to his wife; “we
      must look out or thieves will be breaking in. You had better go and look
      with a candle.”

 He did not sleep all night, and kept getting up to see if his box was all
      right. In the morning he had to go to church to matins. In church the same
      honor is done to rich and poor alike. When Fyodor was poor he used to pray
      in church like this: “God, forgive me, a sinner!” He said the
      same thing now though he had become rich. What difference was there? And
      after death Fyodor rich would not be buried in gold, not in diamonds, but
      in the same black earth as the poorest beggar. Fyodor would burn in the
      same fire as cobblers. Fyodor resented all this, and, too, he felt weighed
      down all over by his dinner, and instead of prayer he had all sorts of
      thoughts in his head about his box of money, about thieves, about his
      bartered, ruined soul.

 He came out of church in a bad temper. To drive away his unpleasant
      thoughts as he had often done before, he struck up a song at the top of
      his voice. But as soon as he began a policeman ran up and said, with his
      fingers to the peak of his cap:

 “Your honor, gentlefolk must not sing in the street! You are not a
      shoemaker!”

 Fyodor leaned his back against a fence and fell to thinking: what could he
      do to amuse himself?

 “Your honor,” a porter shouted to him, “don’t lean
      against the fence, you will spoil your fur coat!”

 Fyodor went into a shop and bought himself the very best concertina, then
      went out into the street playing it. Everybody pointed at him and laughed.

 “And a gentleman, too,” the cabmen jeered at him; “like
      some cobbler....”

 “Is it the proper thing for gentlefolk to be disorderly in the
      street?” a policeman said to him. “You had better go into a
      tavern!”

 “Your honor, give us a trifle, for Christ’s sake,” the
      beggars wailed, surrounding Fyodor on all sides.

 In earlier days when he was a shoemaker the beggars took no notice of him,
      now they wouldn’t let him pass.

 And at home his new wife, the lady, was waiting for him, dressed in a
      green blouse and a red skirt. He meant to be attentive to her, and had
      just lifted his arm to give her a good clout on the back, but she said
      angrily:

 “Peasant! Ignorant lout! You don’t know how to behave with
      ladies! If you love me you will kiss my hand; I don’t allow you to
      beat me.”

 “This is a blasted existence!” thought Fyodor. “People
      do lead a life! You mustn’t sing, you mustn’t play the
      concertina, you mustn’t have a lark with a lady.... Pfoo!”

 He had no sooner sat down to tea with the lady when the evil spirit in the
      blue spectacles appeared and said:

 “Come, Fyodor Pantelyeitch, I have performed my part of the bargain.
      Now sign your paper and come along with me!”

 And he dragged Fyodor to hell, straight to the furnace, and devils flew up
      from all directions and shouted:

 “Fool! Blockhead! Ass!”

 There was a fearful smell of paraffin in hell, enough to suffocate one.
      And suddenly it all vanished. Fyodor opened his eyes and saw his table,
      the boots, and the tin lamp. The lamp-glass was black, and from the faint
      light on the wick came clouds of stinking smoke as from a chimney. Near
      the table stood the customer in the blue spectacles, shouting angrily:

 “Fool! Blockhead! Ass! I’ll give you a lesson, you scoundrel!
      You took the order a fortnight ago and the boots aren’t ready yet!
      Do you suppose I want to come trapesing round here half a dozen times a
      day for my boots? You wretch! you brute!”

 Fyodor shook his head and set to work on the boots. The customer went on
      swearing and threatening him for a long time. At last when he subsided,
      Fyodor asked sullenly:

 “And what is your occupation, sir?”

 “I make Bengal lights and fireworks. I am a pyrotechnician.”

 They began ringing for matins. Fyodor gave the customer the boots, took
      the money for them, and went to church.

 Carriages and sledges with bearskin rugs were dashing to and fro in the
      street; merchants, ladies, officers were walking along the pavement
      together with the humbler folk.... But Fyodor did not envy them nor repine
      at his lot. It seemed to him now that rich and poor were equally badly
      off. Some were able to drive in a carriage, and others to sing songs at
      the top of their voice and to play the concertina, but one and the same
      thing, the same grave, was awaiting all alike, and there was nothing in
      life for which one would give the devil even a tiny scrap of one’s
      soul.
