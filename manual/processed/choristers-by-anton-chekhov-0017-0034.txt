CHORISTERS

  T

HE Justice of the
      Peace, who had received a letter from Petersburg, had set the news going
      that the owner of Yefremovo, Count Vladimir Ivanovitch, would soon be
      arriving. When he would arrive—there was no saying.

 “Like a thief in the night,” said Father Kuzma, a grey-headed
      little priest in a lilac cassock. “And when he does come the place
      will be crowded with the nobility and other high gentry. All the
      neighbours will flock here. Mind now, do your best, Alexey Alexeitch. . .
      . I beg you most earnestly.”

 “You need not trouble about me,” said Alexey Alexeitch,
      frowning. “I know my business. If only my enemy intones the litany
      in the right key. He may . . . out of sheer spite. . . .”

 “There, there. . . . I’ll persuade the deacon. . . I’ll
      persuade him.”

 Alexey Alexeitch was the sacristan of the Yefremovo church. He also taught
      the schoolboys church and secular singing, for which he received sixty
      roubles a year from the revenues of the Count’s estate. The
      schoolboys were bound to sing in church in return for their teaching.
      Alexey Alexeitch was a tall, thick-set man of dignified deportment, with a
      fat, clean-shaven face that reminded one of a cow’s udder. His
      imposing figure and double chin made him look like a man occupying an
      important position in the secular hierarchy rather than a sacristan. It
      was strange to see him, so dignified and imposing, flop to the ground
      before the bishop and, on one occasion, after too loud a squabble with the
      deacon Yevlampy Avdiessov, remain on his knees for two hours by order of
      the head priest of the district. Grandeur was more in keeping with his
      figure than humiliation.

 On account of the rumours of the Count’s approaching visit he had a
      choir practice every day, morning and evening. The choir practice was held
      at the school. It did not interfere much with the school work. During the
      practice the schoolmaster, Sergey Makaritch, set the children writing
      copies while he joined the tenors as an amateur.

 This is how the choir practice was conducted. Alexey Alexeitch would come
      into the school-room, slamming the door and blowing his nose. The trebles
      and altos extricated themselves noisily from the school-tables. The tenors
      and basses, who had been waiting for some time in the yard, came in,
      tramping like horses. They all took their places. Alexey Alexeitch drew
      himself up, made a sign to enforce silence, and struck a note with the
      tuning fork.

 “To-to-li-to-tom . . . Do-mi-sol-do!”

 “Adagio, adagio. . . . Once more.”

 After the “Amen” there followed “Lord have mercy upon us”
      from the Great Litany. All this had been learned long ago, sung a thousand
      times and thoroughly digested, and it was gone through simply as a
      formality. It was sung indolently, unconsciously. Alexey Alexeitch waved
      his arms calmly and chimed in now in a tenor, now in a bass voice. It was
      all slow, there was nothing interesting. . . . But before the “Cherubim”
      hymn the whole choir suddenly began blowing their noses, coughing and
      zealously turning the pages of their music. The sacristan turned his back
      on the choir and with a mysterious expression on his face began tuning his
      violin. The preparations lasted a couple of minutes.

 “Take your places. Look at your music carefully. . . . Basses, don’t
      overdo it . . . rather softly.”

 Bortnyansky’s “Cherubim” hymn, No. 7, was selected. At a
      given signal silence prevailed. All eyes were fastened on the music, the
      trebles opened their mouths. Alexey Alexeitch softly lowered his arm.

 “Piano . . . piano. . . . You see ‘piano’ is written
      there. . . . More lightly, more lightly.”

 When they had to sing “piano” an expression of benevolence and
      amiability overspread Alexey Alexeitch’s face, as though he was
      dreaming of a dainty morsel.

 “Forte . . . forte! Hold it!”

 And when they had to sing “forte” the sacristan’s fat
      face expressed alarm and even horror.

 The “Cherubim” hymn was sung well, so well that the
      school-children abandoned their copies and fell to watching the movements
      of Alexey Alexeitch. People stood under the windows. The school-watchman,
      Vassily, came in wearing an apron and carrying a dinner-knife in his hand
      and stood listening. Father Kuzma, with an anxious face appeared suddenly
      as though he had sprung from out of the earth. . . . After ‘Let us
      lay aside all earthly cares’ Alexey Alexeitch wiped the sweat off
      his brow and went up to Father Kuzma in excitement.

 “It puzzles me, Father Kuzma,” he said, shrugging his
      shoulders, “why is it that the Russian people have no understanding?
      It puzzles me, may the Lord chastise me! Such an uncultured people that
      you really cannot tell whether they have a windpipe in their throats or
      some other sort of internal arrangement. Were you choking, or what?”
      he asked, addressing the bass Gennady Semitchov, the innkeeper’s
      brother.

 “Why?”

 “What is your voice like? It rattles like a saucepan. I bet you were
      boozing yesterday! That’s what it is! Your breath smells like a
      tavern. . . . E-ech! You are a clodhopper, brother! You are a lout! How
      can you be a chorister if you keep company with peasants in the tavern?
      Ech, you are an ass, brother!”

 “It’s a sin, it’s a sin, brother,” muttered Father
      Kuzma. “God sees everything . . . through and through . . . .”

 “That’s why you have no idea of singing—because you care
      more for vodka than for godliness, you fool.”

 “Don’t work yourself up,” said Father Kuzma. “Don’t
      be cross. . . . I will persuade him.”

 Father Kuzma went up to Gennady Semitchov and began “persuading”
      him: “What do you do it for? Try and put your mind to it. A man who
      sings ought to restrain himself, because his throat is . . . er . .
      tender.”

 Gennady scratched his neck and looked sideways towards the window as
      though the words did not apply to him.

 After the “Cherubim” hymn they sang the Creed, then “It
      is meet and right”; they sang smoothly and with feeling, and so
      right on to “Our Father.”

 “To my mind, Father Kuzma,” said the sacristan, “the old
      ‘Our Father’ is better than the modern. That’s what we
      ought to sing before the Count.”

 “No, no. . . . Sing the modern one. For the Count hears nothing but
      modern music when he goes to Mass in Petersburg or Moscow. . . . In the
      churches there, I imagine . . . there’s very different sort of music
      there, brother!”

 After “Our Father” there was again a great blowing of noses,
      coughing and turning over of pages. The most difficult part of the
      performance came next: the “concert.” Alexey Alexeitch was
      practising two pieces, “Who is the God of glory” and “Universal
      Praise.” Whichever the choir learned best would be sung before the
      Count. During the “concert” the sacristan rose to a pitch of
      enthusiasm. The expression of benevolence was continually alternating with
      one of alarm.

 “Forte!” he muttered. “Andante! let yourselves go! Sing,
      you image! Tenors, you don’t bring it off! To-to-ti-to-tom. . . .
      Sol . . . si . . . sol, I tell you, you blockhead! Glory! Basses, glo . .
      . o . . . ry.”

 His bow travelled over the heads and shoulders of the erring trebles and
      altos. His left hand was continually pulling the ears of the young
      singers. On one occasion, carried away by his feelings he flipped the bass
      Gennady under the chin with his bent thumb. But the choristers were not
      moved to tears or to anger at his blows: they realised the full gravity of
      their task.

 After the “concert” came a minute of silence. Alexey
      Alexeitch, red, perspiring and exhausted, sat down on the window-sill, and
      turned upon the company lustreless, wearied, but triumphant eyes. In the
      listening crowd he observed to his immense annoyance the deacon Avdiessov.
      The deacon, a tall thick-set man with a red pock-marked face, and straw in
      his hair, stood leaning against the stove and grinning contemptuously.

 “That’s right, sing away! Perform your music!” he
      muttered in a deep bass. “Much the Count will care for your singing!
      He doesn’t care whether you sing with music or without. . . . For he
      is an atheist.”

 Father Kuzma looked round in a scared way and twiddled his fingers.

 “Come, come,” he muttered. “Hush, deacon, I beg.”

 After the “concert” they sang “May our lips be filled
      with praise,” and the choir practice was over. The choir broke up to
      reassemble in the evening for another practice. And so it went on every
      day.

 One month passed and then a second. . . . The steward, too, had by then
      received a notice that the Count would soon be coming. At last the dusty
      sun-blinds were taken off the windows of the big house, and Yefremovo
      heard the strains of the broken-down, out-of-tune piano. Father Kuzma was
      pining, though he could not himself have said why, or whether it was from
      delight or alarm. . . . The deacon went about grinning.

 The following Saturday evening Father Kuzma went to the sacristan’s
      lodgings. His face was pale, his shoulders drooped, the lilac of his
      cassock looked faded.

 “I have just been at his Excellency’s,” he said to the
      sacristan, stammering. “He is a cultivated gentleman with refined
      ideas. But . . . er . . . it’s mortifying, brother. . . . ‘At
      what o’clock, your Excellency, do you desire us to ring for Mass
      to-morrow?’ And he said: ‘As you think best. Only, couldn’t
      it be as short and quick as possible without a choir.’ Without a
      choir! Er . . . do you understand, without, without a choir. . . .”

 Alexey Alexeitch turned crimson. He would rather have spent two hours on
      his knees again than have heard those words! He did not sleep all night.
      He was not so much mortified at the waste of his labours as at the fact
      that the deacon would give him no peace now with his jeers. The deacon was
      delighted at his discomfiture. Next day all through the service he was
      casting disdainful glances towards the choir where Alexey Alexeitch was
      booming responses in solitude. When he passed by the choir with the censer
      he muttered:

 “Perform your music! Do your utmost! The Count will give a
      ten-rouble note to the choir!”

 After the service the sacristan went home, crushed and ill with
      mortification. At the gate he was overtaken by the red-faced deacon.

 “Stop a minute, Alyosha!” said the deacon. “Stop a
      minute, silly, don’t be cross! You are not the only one, I am in for
      it too! Immediately after the Mass Father Kuzma went up to the Count and
      asked: ‘And what did you think of the deacon’s voice, your
      Excellency. He has a deep bass, hasn’t he?’ And the Count—do
      you know what he answered by way of compliment? ‘Anyone can bawl,’
      he said. ‘A man’s voice is not as important as his brains.’
      A learned gentleman from Petersburg! An atheist is an atheist, and that’s
      all about it! Come, brother in misfortune, let us go and have a drop to
      drown our troubles!”

 And the enemies went out of the gate arm-in-arm.
