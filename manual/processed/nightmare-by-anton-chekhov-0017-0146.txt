A NIGHTMARE

  K

unin, a young man
      of thirty, who was a permanent member of the Rural Board, on returning
      from Petersburg to his district, Borisovo, immediately sent a mounted
      messenger to Sinkino, for the priest there, Father Yakov Smirnov.

 Five hours later Father Yakov appeared.

 “Very glad to make your acquaintance,” said Kunin, meeting him
      in the entry. “I’ve been living and serving here for a year;
      it seems as though we ought to have been acquainted before. You are very
      welcome! But . . . how young you are!” Kunin added in surprise.
      “What is your age?”

 “Twenty-eight, . . .” said Father Yakov, faintly pressing
      Kunin’s outstretched hand, and for some reason turning crimson.

 Kunin led his visitor into his study and began looking at him more
      attentively.

 “What an uncouth womanish face!” he thought.

 There certainly was a good deal that was womanish in Father Yakov’s
      face: the turned-up nose, the bright red cheeks, and the large grey-blue
      eyes with scanty, scarcely perceptible eyebrows. His long reddish hair,
      smooth and dry, hung down in straight tails on to his shoulders. The hair
      on his upper lip was only just beginning to form into a real masculine
      moustache, while his little beard belonged to that class of
      good-for-nothing beards which among divinity students are for some reason
      called “ticklers.” It was scanty and extremely transparent; it
      could not have been stroked or combed, it could only have been pinched. .
      . . All these scanty decorations were put on unevenly in tufts, as though
      Father Yakov, thinking to dress up as a priest and beginning to gum on the
      beard, had been interrupted halfway through. He had on a cassock, the
      colour of weak coffee with chicory in it, with big patches on both elbows.

 “A queer type,” thought Kunin, looking at his muddy skirts.
      “Comes to the house for the first time and can’t dress
      decently.

 “Sit down, Father,” he began more carelessly than cordially,
      as he moved an easy-chair to the table. “Sit down, I beg you.”

 Father Yakov coughed into his fist, sank awkwardly on to the edge of the
      chair, and laid his open hands on his knees. With his short figure, his
      narrow chest, his red and perspiring face, he made from the first moment a
      most unpleasant impression on Kunin. The latter could never have imagined
      that there were such undignified and pitiful-looking priests in Russia;
      and in Father Yakov’s attitude, in the way he held his hands on his
      knees and sat on the very edge of his chair, he saw a lack of dignity and
      even a shade of servility.

 “I have invited you on business, Father. . . .” Kunin began,
      sinking back in his low chair. “It has fallen to my lot to perform
      the agreeable duty of helping you in one of your useful undertakings. . .
      . On coming back from Petersburg, I found on my table a letter from the
      Marshal of Nobility. Yegor Dmitrevitch suggests that I should take under
      my supervision the church parish school which is being opened in Sinkino.
      I shall be very glad to, Father, with all my heart. . . . More than that,
      I accept the proposition with enthusiasm.”

 Kunin got up and walked about the study.

 “Of course, both Yegor Dmitrevitch and probably you, too, are aware
      that I have not great funds at my disposal. My estate is mortgaged, and I
      live exclusively on my salary as the permanent member. So that you cannot
      reckon on very much assistance, but I will do all that is in my power. . .
      . And when are you thinking of opening the school Father?”

 “When we have the money, . . .” answered Father Yakov.

 “You have some funds at your disposal already?”

 “Scarcely any. . . . The peasants settled at their meeting that they
      would pay, every man of them, thirty kopecks a year; but that’s only
      a promise, you know! And for the first beginning we should need at least
      two hundred roubles. . . .”

 “M’yes. . . . Unhappily, I have not that sum now,” said
      Kunin with a sigh. “I spent all I had on my tour and got into debt,
      too. Let us try and think of some plan together.”

 Kunin began planning aloud. He explained his views and watched Father
      Yakov’s face, seeking signs of agreement or approval in it. But the
      face was apathetic and immobile, and expressed nothing but constrained
      shyness and uneasiness. Looking at it, one might have supposed that Kunin
      was talking of matters so abstruse that Father Yakov did not understand
      and only listened from good manners, and was at the same time afraid of
      being detected in his failure to understand.

 “The fellow is not one of the brightest, that’s evident . . .”
      thought Kunin. “He’s rather shy and much too stupid.”

 Father Yakov revived somewhat and even smiled only when the footman came
      into the study bringing in two glasses of tea on a tray and a cake-basket
      full of biscuits. He took his glass and began drinking at once.

 “Shouldn’t we write at once to the bishop?” Kunin went
      on, meditating aloud. “To be precise, you know, it is not we, not
      the Zemstvo, but the higher ecclesiastical authorities, who have raised
      the question of the church parish schools. They ought really to apportion
      the funds. I remember I read that a sum of money had been set aside for
      the purpose. Do you know nothing about it?”

 Father Yakov was so absorbed in drinking tea that he did not answer this
      question at once. He lifted his grey-blue eyes to Kunin, thought a moment,
      and as though recalling his question, he shook his head in the negative.
      An expression of pleasure and of the most ordinary prosaic appetite
      overspread his face from ear to ear. He drank and smacked his lips over
      every gulp. When he had drunk it to the very last drop, he put his glass
      on the table, then took his glass back again, looked at the bottom of it,
      then put it back again. The expression of pleasure faded from his face. .
      . . Then Kunin saw his visitor take a biscuit from the cake-basket, nibble
      a little bit off it, then turn it over in his hand and hurriedly stick it
      in his pocket.

 “Well, that’s not at all clerical!” thought Kunin,
      shrugging his shoulders contemptuously. “What is it, priestly greed
      or childishness?”

 After giving his visitor another glass of tea and seeing him to the entry,
      Kunin lay down on the sofa and abandoned himself to the unpleasant feeling
      induced in him by the visit of Father Yakov.

 “What a strange wild creature!” he thought. “Dirty,
      untidy, coarse, stupid, and probably he drinks. . . . My God, and that’s
      a priest, a spiritual father! That’s a teacher of the people! I can
      fancy the irony there must be in the deacon’s face when before every
      mass he booms out: ‘Thy blessing, Reverend Father!’ A fine
      reverend Father! A reverend Father without a grain of dignity or breeding,
      hiding biscuits in his pocket like a schoolboy. . . . Fie! Good Lord,
      where were the bishop’s eyes when he ordained a man like that? What
      can he think of the people if he gives them a teacher like that? One wants
      people here who . . .”

 And Kunin thought what Russian priests ought to be like.

 “If I were a priest, for instance. . . . An educated priest fond of
      his work might do a great deal. . . . I should have had the school opened
      long ago. And the sermons? If the priest is sincere and is inspired by
      love for his work, what wonderful rousing sermons he might give!”

 Kunin shut his eyes and began mentally composing a sermon. A little later
      he sat down to the table and rapidly began writing.

 “I’ll give it to that red-haired fellow, let him read it in
      church, . . .” he thought.

 The following Sunday Kunin drove over to Sinkino in the morning to settle
      the question of the school, and while he was there to make acquaintance
      with the church of which he was a parishioner. In spite of the awful state
      of the roads, it was a glorious morning. The sun was shining brightly and
      cleaving with its rays the layers of white snow still lingering here and
      there. The snow as it took leave of the earth glittered with such diamonds
      that it hurt the eyes to look, while the young winter corn was hastily
      thrusting up its green beside it. The rooks floated with dignity over the
      fields. A rook would fly, drop to earth, and give several hops before
      standing firmly on its feet. . . .

 The wooden church up to which Kunin drove was old and grey; the columns of
      the porch had once been painted white, but the colour had now completely
      peeled off, and they looked like two ungainly shafts. The ikon over the
      door looked like a dark smudged blur. But its poverty touched and softened
      Kunin. Modestly dropping his eyes, he went into the church and stood by
      the door. The service had only just begun. An old sacristan, bent into a
      bow, was reading the “Hours” in a hollow indistinct tenor.
      Father Yakov, who conducted the service without a deacon, was walking
      about the church, burning incense. Had it not been for the softened mood
      in which Kunin found himself on entering the poverty-stricken church, he
      certainly would have smiled at the sight of Father Yakov. The short priest
      was wearing a crumpled and extremely long robe of some shabby yellow
      material; the hem of the robe trailed on the ground.

 The church was not full. Looking at the parishioners, Kunin was struck at
      the first glance by one strange circumstance: he saw nothing but old
      people and children. . . . Where were the men of working age? Where was
      the youth and manhood? But after he had stood there a little and looked
      more attentively at the aged-looking faces, Kunin saw that he had mistaken
      young people for old. He did not, however, attach any significance to this
      little optical illusion.

 The church was as cold and grey inside as outside. There was not one spot
      on the ikons nor on the dark brown walls which was not begrimed and
      defaced by time. There were many windows, but the general effect of colour
      was grey, and so it was twilight in the church.

 “Anyone pure in soul can pray here very well,” thought Kunin.
      “Just as in St. Peter’s in Rome one is impressed by grandeur,
      here one is touched by the lowliness and simplicity.”

 But his devout mood vanished like smoke as soon as Father Yakov went up to
      the altar and began mass. Being still young and having come straight from
      the seminary bench to the priesthood, Father Yakov had not yet formed a
      set manner of celebrating the service. As he read he seemed to be
      vacillating between a high tenor and a thin bass; he bowed clumsily,
      walked quickly, and opened and shut the gates abruptly. . . . The old
      sacristan, evidently deaf and ailing, did not hear the prayers very
      distinctly, and this very often led to slight misunderstandings. Before
      Father Yakov had time to finish what he had to say, the sacristan began
      chanting his response, or else long after Father Yakov had finished the
      old man would be straining his ears, listening in the direction of the
      altar and saying nothing till his skirt was pulled. The old man had a
      sickly hollow voice and an asthmatic quavering lisp. . . . The complete
      lack of dignity and decorum was emphasized by a very small boy who
      seconded the sacristan and whose head was hardly visible over the railing
      of the choir. The boy sang in a shrill falsetto and seemed to be trying to
      avoid singing in tune. Kunin stayed a little while, listened and went out
      for a smoke. He was disappointed, and looked at the grey church almost
      with dislike.

 “They complain of the decline of religious feeling among the people
      . . .” he sighed. “I should rather think so! They’d
      better foist a few more priests like this one on them!”

 Kunin went back into the church three times, and each time he felt a great
      temptation to get out into the open air again. Waiting till the end of the
      mass, he went to Father Yakov’s. The priest’s house did not
      differ outwardly from the peasants’ huts, but the thatch lay more
      smoothly on the roof and there were little white curtains in the windows.
      Father Yakov led Kunin into a light little room with a clay floor and
      walls covered with cheap paper; in spite of some painful efforts towards
      luxury in the way of photographs in frames and a clock with a pair of
      scissors hanging on the weight the furnishing of the room impressed him by
      its scantiness. Looking at the furniture, one might have supposed that
      Father Yakov had gone from house to house and collected it in bits; in one
      place they had given him a round three-legged table, in another a stool,
      in a third a chair with a back bent violently backwards; in a fourth a
      chair with an upright back, but the seat smashed in; while in a fifth they
      had been liberal and given him a semblance of a sofa with a flat back and
      a lattice-work seat. This semblance had been painted dark red and smelt
      strongly of paint. Kunin meant at first to sit down on one of the chairs,
      but on second thoughts he sat down on the stool.

 “This is the first time you have been to our church?” asked
      Father Yakov, hanging his hat on a huge misshapen nail.

 “Yes it is. I tell you what, Father, before we begin on business,
      will you give me some tea? My soul is parched.”

 Father Yakov bElinked, gasped, and went behind the partition wall. There
      was a sound of whispering.

 “With his wife, I suppose,” thought Kunin; “it would be
      interesting to see what the red-headed fellow’s wife is like.”

 A little later Father Yakov came back, red and perspiring and with an
      effort to smile, sat down on the edge of the sofa.

 “They will heat the samovar directly,” he said, without
      looking at his visitor.

 “My goodness, they have not heated the samovar yet!” Kunin
      thought with horror. “A nice time we shall have to wait.”

 “I have brought you,” he said, “the rough draft of the
      letter I have written to the bishop. I’ll read it after tea; perhaps
      you may find something to add. . . .”

 “Very well.”

 A silence followed. Father Yakov threw furtive glances at the partition
      wall, smoothed his hair, and blew his nose.

 “It’s wonderful weather, . . .” he said.

 “Yes. I read an interesting thing yesterday. . . . the Volsky
      Zemstvo have decided to give their schools to the clergy, that’s
      typical.”

 Kunin got up, and pacing up and down the clay floor, began to give
      expression to his reflections.

 “That would be all right,” he said, “if only the clergy
      were equal to their high calling and recognized their tasks. I am so
      unfortunate as to know priests whose standard of culture and whose moral
      qualities make them hardly fit to be army secretaries, much less priests.
      You will agree that a bad teacher does far less harm than a bad priest.”

 Kunin glanced at Father Yakov; he was sitting bent up, thinking intently
      about something and apparently not listening to his visitor.

 “Yasha, come here!” a woman’s voice called from behind
      the partition. Father Yakov started and went out. Again a whispering
      began.

 Kunin felt a pang of longing for tea.

 “No; it’s no use my waiting for tea here,” he thought,
      looking at his watch. “Besides I fancy I am not altogether a welcome
      visitor. My host has not deigned to say one word to me; he simply sits and
      bElinks.”

 Kunin took up his hat, waited for Father Yakov to return, and said
      good-bye to him.

 “I have simply wasted the morning,” he thought wrathfully on
      the way home. “The blockhead! The dummy! He cares no more about the
      school than I about last year’s snow. . . . No, I shall never get
      anything done with him! We are bound to fail! If the Marshal knew what the
      priest here was like, he wouldn’t be in such a hurry to talk about a
      school. We ought first to try and get a decent priest, and then think
      about the school.”

 By now Kunin almost hated Father Yakov. The man, his pitiful, grotesque
      figure in the long crumpled robe, his womanish face, his manner of
      officiating, his way of life and his formal restrained respectfulness,
      wounded the tiny relic of religious feeling which was stored away in a
      warm corner of Kunin’s heart together with his nurse’s other
      fairy tales. The coldness and lack of attention with which Father Yakov
      had met Kunin’s warm and sincere interest in what was the priest’s
      own work was hard for the former’s vanity to endure. . . .

 On the evening of the same day Kunin spent a long time walking about his
      rooms and thinking. Then he sat down to the table resolutely and wrote a
      letter to the bishop. After asking for money and a blessing for the
      school, he set forth genuinely, like a son, his opinion of the priest at
      Sinkino.

 “He is young,” he wrote, “insufficiently educated,
      leads, I fancy, an intemperate life, and altogether fails to satisfy the
      ideals which the Russian people have in the course of centuries formed of
      what a pastor should be.”

 After writing this letter Kunin heaved a deep sigh, and went to bed with
      the consciousness that he had done a good deed.

 On Monday morning, while he was still in bed, he was informed that Father
      Yakov had arrived. He did not want to get up, and instructed the servant
      to say he was not at home. On Tuesday he went away to a sitting of the
      Board, and when he returned on Saturday he was told by the servants that
      Father Yakov had called every day in his absence.

 “He liked my biscuits, it seems,” he thought.

 Towards evening on Sunday Father Yakov arrived. This time not only his
      skirts, but even his hat, was bespattered with mud. Just as on his first
      visit, he was hot and perspiring, and sat down on the edge of his chair as
      he had done then. Kunin determined not to talk about the school—not
      to cast pearls.

 “I have brought you a list of books for the school, Pavel
      Mihailovitch, . . .” Father Yakov began.

 “Thank you.”

 But everything showed that Father Yakov had come for something else
      besides the list. Has whole figure was expressive of extreme
      embarrassment, and at the same time there was a look of determination upon
      his face, as on the face of a man suddenly inspired by an idea. He
      struggled to say something important, absolutely necessary, and strove to
      overcome his timidity.

 “Why is he dumb?” Kunin thought wrathfully. “He’s
      settled himself comfortably! I haven’t time to be bothered with him.”

 To smoothe over the awkwardness of his silence and to conceal the struggle
      going on within him, the priest began to smile constrainedly, and this
      slow smile, wrung out on his red perspiring face, and out of keeping with
      the fixed look in his grey-blue eyes, made Kunin turn away. He felt moved
      to repulsion.

 “Excuse me, Father, I have to go out,” he said.

 Father Yakov started like a man asleep who has been struck a blow, and,
      still smiling, began in his confusion wrapping round him the skirts of his
      cassock. In spite of his repulsion for the man, Kunin felt suddenly sorry
      for him, and he wanted to soften his cruelty.

 “Please come another time, Father,” he said, “and before
      we part I want to ask you a favour. I was somehow inspired to write two
      sermons the other day. . . . I will give them to you to look at. If they
      are suitable, use them.”

 “Very good,” said Father Yakov, laying his open hand on Kunin’s
      sermons which were lying on the table. “I will take them.”

 After standing a little, hesitating and still wrapping his cassock round
      him, he suddenly gave up the effort to smile and lifted his head
      resolutely.

 “Pavel Mihailovitch,” he said, evidently trying to speak
      loudly and distinctly.

 “What can I do for you?”

 “I have heard that you . . . er . . . have dismissed your secretary,
      and . . . and are looking for a new one. . . .”

 “Yes, I am. . . . Why, have you someone to recommend?”

 “I. . . er . . . you see . . . I . . . Could you not give the post
      to me?”

 “Why, are you giving up the Church?” said Kunin in amazement.

 “No, no,” Father Yakov brought out quickly, for some reason
      turning pale and trembling all over. “God forbid! If you feel
      doubtful, then never mind, never mind. You see, I could do the work
      between whiles, . . so as to increase my income. . . . Never mind, don’t
      disturb yourself!”

 “H’m! . . . your income. . . . But you know, I only pay my
      secretary twenty roubles a month.”

 “Good heavens! I would take ten,” whispered Father Yakov,
      looking about him. “Ten would be enough! You . . . you are
      astonished, and everyone is astonished. The greedy priest, the grasping
      priest, what does he do with his money? I feel myself I am greedy, . . .
      and I blame myself, I condemn myself. . . . I am ashamed to look people in
      the face. . . . I tell you on my conscience, Pavel Mihailovitch. . . . I
      call the God of truth to witness. . . .”

 Father Yakov took breath and went on:

 “On the way here I prepared a regular confession to make you, but .
      . . I’ve forgotten it all; I cannot find a word now. I get a hundred
      and fifty roubles a year from my parish, and everyone wonders what I do
      with the money. . . . But I’ll explain it all truly. . . . I pay
      forty roubles a year to the clerical school for my brother Pyotr. He has
      everything found there, except that I have to provide pens and paper.”

 “Oh, I believe you; I believe you! But what’s the object of
      all this?” said Kunin, with a wave of the hand, feeling terribly
      oppressed by this outburst of confidence on the part of his visitor, and
      not knowing how to get away from the tearful gleam in his eyes.

 “Then I have not yet paid up all that I owe to the consistory for my
      place here. They charged me two hundred roubles for the living, and I was
      to pay ten roubles a month. . . . You can judge what is left! And,
      besides, I must allow Father Avraamy at least three roubles a month.”

 “What Father Avraamy?”

 “Father Avraamy who was priest at Sinkino before I came. He was
      deprived of the living on account of . . . his failing, but you know, he
      is still living at Sinkino! He has nowhere to go. There is no one to keep
      him. Though he is old, he must have a corner, and food and clothing—I
      can’t let him go begging on the roads in his position! It would be
      on my conscience if anything happened! It would be my fault! He is. . . in
      debt all round; but, you see, I am to blame for not paying for him.”

 Father Yakov started up from his seat and, looking frantically at the
      floor, strode up and down the room.

 “My God, my God!” he muttered, raising his hands and dropping
      them again. “Lord, save us and have mercy upon us! Why did you take
      such a calling on yourself if you have so little faith and no strength?
      There is no end to my despair! Save me, Queen of Heaven!”

 “Calm yourself, Father,” said Kunin.

 “I am worn out with hunger, Pavel Mihailovitch,” Father Yakov
      went on. “Generously forgive me, but I am at the end of my strength
      . . . . I know if I were to beg and to bow down, everyone would help, but
      . . . I cannot! I am ashamed. How can I beg of the peasants? You are on
      the Board here, so you know. . . . How can one beg of a beggar? And to beg
      of richer people, of landowners, I cannot! I have pride! I am ashamed!”

 Father Yakov waved his hand, and nervously scratched his head with both
      hands.

 “I am ashamed! My God, I am ashamed! I am proud and can’t bear
      people to see my poverty! When you visited me, Pavel Mihailovitch, I had
      no tea in the house! There wasn’t a pinch of it, and you know it was
      pride prevented me from telling you! I am ashamed of my clothes, of these
      patches here. . . . I am ashamed of my vestments, of being hungry. . . .
      And is it seemly for a priest to be proud?”

 Father Yakov stood still in the middle of the study, and, as though he did
      not notice Kunin’s presence, began reasoning with himself.

 “Well, supposing I endure hunger and disgrace—but, my God, I
      have a wife! I took her from a good home! She is not used to hard work;
      she is soft; she is used to tea and white bread and sheets on her bed. . .
      . At home she used to play the piano. . . . She is young, not twenty yet.
      . . . She would like, to be sure, to be smart, to have fun, go out to see
      people. . . . And she is worse off with me than any cook; she is ashamed
      to show herself in the street. My God, my God! Her only treat is when I
      bring an apple or some biscuit from a visit. . . .”

 Father Yakov scratched his head again with both hands.

 “And it makes us feel not love but pity for each other. . . . I
      cannot look at her without compassion! And the things that happen in this
      life, O Lord! Such things that people would not believe them if they saw
      them in the newspaper. . . . And when will there be an end to it all!”

 “Hush, Father!” Kunin almost shouted, frightened at his tone.
      “Why take such a gloomy view of life?”

 “Generously forgive me, Pavel Mihailovitch . . .” muttered
      Father Yakov as though he were drunk, “Forgive me, all this . . .
      doesn’t matter, and don’t take any notice of it. . . . Only I
      do blame myself, and always shall blame myself . . . always.”

 Father Yakov looked about him and began whispering:

 “One morning early I was going from Sinkino to Lutchkovo; I saw a
      woman standing on the river bank, doing something. . . . I went up close
      and could not believe my eyes. . . . It was horrible! The wife of the
      doctor, Ivan Sergeitch, was sitting there washing her linen. . . . A
      doctor’s wife, brought up at a select boarding-school! She had got
      up you see, early and gone half a mile from the village that people should
      not see her. . . . She couldn’t get over her pride! When she saw
      that I was near her and noticed her poverty, she turned red all over. . .
      . I was flustered—I was frightened, and ran up to help her, but she
      hid her linen from me; she was afraid I should see her ragged chemises. .
      . .”

 “All this is positively incredible,” said Kunin, sitting down
      and looking almost with horror at Father Yakov’s pale face.

 “Incredible it is! It’s a thing that has never been! Pavel
      Mihailovitch, that a doctor’s wife should be rinsing the linen in
      the river! Such a thing does not happen in any country! As her pastor and
      spiritual father, I ought not to allow it, but what can I do? What? Why, I
      am always trying to get treated by her husband for nothing myself! It is
      true that, as you say, it is all incredible! One can hardly believe one’s
      eyes. During Mass, you know, when I look out from the altar and see my
      congregation, Avraamy starving, and my wife, and think of the doctor’s
      wife—how blue her hands were from the cold water—would you
      believe it, I forget myself and stand senseless like a fool, until the
      sacristan calls to me. . . . It’s awful!”

 Father Yakov began walking about again.

 “Lord Jesus!” he said, waving his hands, “holy Saints! I
      can’t officiate properly. . . . Here you talk to me about the
      school, and I sit like a dummy and don’t understand a word, and
      think of nothing but food. . . . Even before the altar. . . . But . . .
      what am I doing?” Father Yakov pulled himself up suddenly. “You
      want to go out. Forgive me, I meant nothing. . . . Excuse . . .”

 Kunin shook hands with Father Yakov without speaking, saw him into the
      hall, and going back into his study, stood at the window. He saw Father
      Yakov go out of the house, pull his wide-brimmed rusty-looking hat over
      his eyes, and slowly, bowing his head, as though ashamed of his outburst,
      walk along the road.

 “I don’t see his horse,” thought Kunin.

 Kunin did not dare to think that the priest had come on foot every day to
      see him; it was five or six miles to Sinkino, and the mud on the road was
      impassable. Further on he saw the coachman Andrey and the boy Paramon,
      jumping over the puddles and splashing Father Yakov with mud, run up to
      him for his blessing. Father Yakov took off his hat and slowly blessed
      Andrey, then blessed the boy and stroked his head.

 Kunin passed his hand over his eyes, and it seemed to him that his hand
      was moist. He walked away from the window and with dim eyes looked round
      the room in which he still seemed to hear the timid droning voice. He
      glanced at the table. Luckily, Father Yakov, in his haste, had forgotten
      to take the sermons. Kunin rushed up to them, tore them into pieces, and
      with loathing thrust them under the table.

 “And I did not know!” he moaned, sinking on to the sofa.
      “After being here over a year as member of the Rural Board, Honorary
      Justice of the Peace, member of the School Committee! Blind puppet,
      egregious idiot! I must make haste and help them, I must make haste!”

 He turned from side to side uneasily, pressed his temples and racked his
      brains.

 “On the twentieth I shall get my salary, two hundred roubles. . . .
      On some good pretext I will give him some, and some to the doctor’s
      wife. . . . I will ask them to perform a special service here, and will
      get up an illness for the doctor. . . . In that way I shan’t wound
      their pride. And I’ll help Father Avraamy too. . . .”

 He reckoned his money on his fingers, and was afraid to own to himself
      that those two hundred roubles would hardly be enough for him to pay his
      steward, his servants, the peasant who brought the meat. . . . He could
      not help remembering the recent past when he was senselessly squandering
      his father’s fortune, when as a puppy of twenty he had given
      expensive fans to prostitutes, had paid ten roubles a day to Kuzma, his
      cab-driver, and in his vanity had made presents to actresses. Oh, how
      useful those wasted rouble, three-rouble, ten-rouble notes would have been
      now!

 “Father Avraamy lives on three roubles a month!” thought
      Kunin. “For a rouble the priest’s wife could get herself a
      chemise, and the doctor’s wife could hire a washerwoman. But I’ll
      help them, anyway! I must help them.”

 Here Kunin suddenly recalled the private information he had sent to the
      bishop, and he writhed as from a sudden draught of cold air. This
      remembrance filled him with overwhelming shame before his inner self and
      before the unseen truth.

 So had begun and had ended a sincere effort to be of public service on the
      part of a well-intentioned but unreflecting and over-comfortable person.
