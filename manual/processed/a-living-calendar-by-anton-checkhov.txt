State-Councillor Sharamykin's drawing-room is wrapped in a pleasant
      half-darkness. The big bronze lamp with the green shade, makes the walls,
      the furniture, the faces, all green, couleur "Nuit d'Ukraine"
      Occasionally a smouldering log flares up in the dying fire and for a
      moment casts a red glow over the faces; but this does not spoil the
      general harmony of light. The general tone, as the painters say, is well
      sustained.
    

      Sharamykin sits in a chair in front of the fireplace, in the attitude of a
      man who has just dined. He is an elderly man with a high official's grey
      side whiskers and meek blue eyes. Tenderness is shed over his face, and
      his lips are set in a melancholy smile. At his feet, stretched out lazily,
      with his legs towards the fire-place, Vice-Governor Lopniev sits on a
      little stool. He is a brave-looking man of about forty. Sharamykin's
      children are moving about round the piano; Nina, Kolya, Nadya, and Vanya.
      The door leading to Madame Sharamykin's room is slightly open and the
      light breaks through timidly. There behind the door sits Sharamykin's
      wife, Anna Pavlovna, in front of her writing-table. She is president of
      the local ladies' committee, a lively, piquant lady of thirty years and a
      little bit over. Through her pince-nez her vivacious black eyes are
      running over the pages of a French novel. Beneath the novel lies a
      tattered copy of the report of the committee for last year.
    

      "Formerly our town was much better off in these things," says Sharamykin,
      screwing up his meek eyes at the glowing coals. "Never a winter passed but
      some star would pay us a visit. Famous actors and singers used to come ...
      but now, besides acrobats and organ-grinders, the devil only knows what
      comes. There's no aesthetic pleasure at all.... We might be living in a
      forest. Yes.... And does your Excellency remember that Italian
      tragedian?... What's his name?... He was so dark, and tall.... Let me
      think.... Oh, yes! Luigi Ernesto di Ruggiero.... Remarkable talent.... And
      strength. He had only to say one word and the whole theatre was on the qui
      vive. My darling Anna used to take a great interest in his talent. She
      hired the theatre for him and sold tickets for the performances in
      advance.... In return he taught her elocution and gesture. A first-rate
      fellow! He came here ... to be quite exact ... twelve years ago.... No,
      that's not true.... Less, ten years.... Anna dear, how old is our Nina?"
    

      "She'll be ten next birthday," calls Anna Pavlovna from her room. "Why?"
    

      "Nothing in particular, my dear. I was just curious.... And good singers
      used to come. Do you remember Prilipchin, the tenore di grazia?
      What a charming fellow he was! How good looking! Fair ... a very
      expressive face, Parisian manners.... And what a voice, your Excellency!
      Only one weakness: he would sing some notes with his stomach and would
      take re falsetto—otherwise everything was good. Tamberlik, he
      said, had taught him.... My dear Anna and I hired a hall for him at the
      Social Club, and in gratitude for that he used to sing to us for whole
      days and nights.... He taught dear Anna to sing. He came—I remember
      it as though it were last night—in Lent, some twelve years ago. No,
      it's more.... How bad my memory is getting, Heaven help me! Anna dear, how
      old is our darling Nadya?
    

      "Twelve."
    

      "Twelve ... then we've got to add ten months.... That makes it exact ...
      thirteen. Somehow there used to be more life in our town then.... Take,
      for instance, the charity soirÃ©es. What enjoyable soirÃ©es we used to have
      before! How elegant! There were singing, playing, and recitation.... After
      the war, I remember, when the Turkish prisoners were here, dear Anna
      arranged a soiree on behalf of the wounded. We collected eleven hundred
      roubles. I remember the Turkish officers were passionately fond of dear
      Anna's voice, and kissed her hand incessantly. He-he! Asiatics, but a
      grateful nation. Would you believe me, the soiree was such a success that
      I wrote an account of it in my diary? It was,—I remember it as
      though it had only just happened,—in '76,... no, in '77.... No!
      Pray, when were the Turks here? Anna dear, how old is our little Kolya?"
    

      "I'm seven, Papa!" says Kolya, a brat with a swarthy face and coal black
      hair.
    

      "Yes, we're old, and we've lost the energy we used to have," Lopniev
      agreed with a sigh. "That's the real cause. Old age, my friend. No new
      moving spirits arrive, and the old ones grow old.... The old fire is dull
      now. When I was younger I did not like company to be bored.... I was your
      Anna Pavlovna's first assistant. Whether it was a charity soirÃ©e or a
      tombola to support a star who was going to arrive, whatever Anna Pavlovna
      was arranging, I used to throw over everything and begin to bustle about.
      One winter, I remember, I bustled and ran so much that I even got ill....
      I shan't forget that winter.... Do you remember what a performance we
      arranged with Anna Pavlovna in aid of the victims of the fire?"
    

      "What year was it?"
    

      "Not so very long ago.... In '79. No, in '80, I believe! Tell me how old
      is your Vanya?"
    

      "Five," Anna Pavlovna calls from the study.
    

      "Well, that means it was six years ago. Yes, my dear friend, that was a
      time. It's all over now. The old fire's quite gone."
    

      Lopniev and Sharamykin grew thoughtful. The smouldering log flares up for
      the last time, and then is covered in ash.
    





      State-Councillor Usielkov, architect, arrived in his native town, where he
      had been summoned to restore the cemetery church. He was born in the town,
      he had grown up and been married there, and yet when he got out of the
      train he hardly recognised it. Everything was changed. For instance,
      eighteen years ago, when he left the town to settle in Petersburg, where
      the railway station is now boys used to hunt for marmots: now as you come
      into the High Street there is a four storied "Hotel Vienna," with
      apartments, where there was of old an ugly grey fence. But not the fence
      or the houses, or anything had changed so much as the people. Questioning
      the hall-porter, Usielkov discovered that more than half of the people he
      remembered were dead or paupers or forgotten.
    

      "Do you remember Usielkov?" he asked the porter. "Usielkov, the architect,
      who divorced his wife.... He had a house in Sviribev Street.... Surely you
      remember."
    

      "No, I don't remember anyone of the name."
    

      "Why, it's impossible not to remember. It was an exciting case. All the
      cabmen knew, even. Try to remember. His divorce was managed by the
      attorney, Shapkin, the swindler ... the notorious sharper, the man who was
      thrashed at the dub...."
    

      "You mean Ivan Nicolaich?"
    

      "Yes.... Is he alive? dead?"
    

      "Thank heaven, his honour's alive. His honour's a notary now, with an
      office. Well-to-do. Two houses in Kirpichny Street. Just lately married
      his daughter off."
    

      Usielkov strode from one corner of the room to another. An idea flashed
      into his mind. From boredom, he decided to see Shapkin. It was afternoon
      when he left the hotel and quietly walked to Kirpichny Street. He found
      Shapkin in his office and hardly recognised him. From the well-built,
      alert attorney with a quick, impudent, perpetually tipsy expression,
      Shapkin had become a modest, grey-haired, shrunken old man.
    

      "You don't recognise me.... You have forgotten ...." Usielkov began. "I'm
      your old client, Usielkov."
    

      "Usielkov? Which Usielkov? Ah!" Remembrance came to Shapkin: he recognised
      him and was confused. Began exclamations, questions, recollections.
    

      "Never expected ... never thought...." chuckled Shapkin. "What will you
      have? Would you like champagne? Perhaps you'd like oysters. My dear man,
      what a lot of money I got out of you in the old days—so much that I
      can't think what I ought to stand you."
    

      "Please don't trouble," said Usielkov. "I haven't time. I must go to the
      cemetery and examine the church. I have a commission."
    

      "Splendid. We'll have something to eat and a drink and go together. I've
      got some splendid horses! I'll take you there and introduce you to the
      churchwarden.... I'll fix up everything.... But what's the matter, my
      dearest man? You're not avoiding me, not afraid? Please sit nearer.
      There's nothing to be afraid of now.... Long ago, I really was pretty
      sharp, a bit of a rogue ... but now I'm quieter than water, humbler than
      grass. I've grown old; got a family. There are children.... Time to die!"
    

      The friends had something to eat and drink, and went in a coach and pair
      to the cemetery.
    

      "Yes, it was a good time," Shapkin was reminiscent, sitting in the sledge.
      "I remember, but I simply can't believe it. Do you remember how you
      divorced your wife? It's almost twenty years ago, and you've probably
      forgotten everything, but I remember it as though I conducted the petition
      yesterday. My God, how rotten I was! Then I was a smart, casuistical
      devil, full of sharp practice and devilry.... and I used to run into some
      shady affairs, particularly when there was a good fee, as in your case,
      for instance. What was it you paid me then? Five—six hundred. Enough
      to upset anybody! By the time you left for Petersburg you'd left the whole
      affair completely in my hands. 'Do what you like!' And your former wife,
      Sophia Mikhailovna, though she did come from a merchant family, was proud
      and selfish. To bribe her to take the guilt on herself was difficult—extremely
      difficult. I used to come to her for a business talk, and when she saw me,
      she would say to her maid: 'Masha, surely I told you I wasn't at home to
      scoundrels.' I tried one way, then another ... wrote letters to her, tried
      to meet her accidentally—no good. I had to work through a third
      person. For a long time I had trouble with her, and she only yielded when
      you agreed to give her ten thousand. She could not stand out against ten
      thousand. She succumbed.... She began to weep, spat in my face, but she
      yielded and took the guilt on herself."
    

      "If I remember it was fifteen, not ten thousand she took from me," said
      Usielkov.
    

      "Yes, of course ... fifteen, my mistake." Shapkin was disconcerted.
      "Anyway it's all past and done with now. Why shouldn't I confess, frankly?
      Ten I gave to her, and the remaining five I bargained out of you for my
      own share. I deceived both of you.... It's all past, why be ashamed of it?
      And who else was there to take from, Boris Pietrovich, if not from you? I
      ask you.... You were rich and well-to-do. You married in caprice: you were
      divorced in caprice. You were making a fortune. I remember you got twenty
      thousand out of a single contract. Whom was I to tap, if not you? And I
      must confess, I was tortured by envy. If you got hold of a nice lot of
      money, people would take off their hats to you: but the same people would
      beat me for shillings and smack my face in the club. But why recall it?
      It's time to forget."
    

      "Tell me, please, how did Sophia Mikhailovna live afterwards?"
    

      "With her ten thousand? On ne peut plus badly.... God knows whether
      it was frenzy or pride and conscience that tortured her, because she had
      sold herself for money—or perhaps she loved you; but, she took to
      drink, you know. She received the money and began to gad about with
      officers in troikas.... Drunkenness, philandering, debauchery.... She
      would come into a tavern with an officer, and instead of port or a light
      wine, she would drink the strongest cognac to drive her into a frenzy."
    

      "Yes, she was eccentric. I suffered enough with her. She would take
      offence at some trifle and then get nervous.... And what happened
      afterwards?"
    

      "A week passed, a fortnight.... I was sitting at home writing. Suddenly,
      the door opened and she comes in. 'Take your cursed money,' she said, and
      threw the parcel in my face.... She could not resist it.... Five hundred
      were missing. She had only got rid of five hundred."
    

      "And what did you do with the money?"
    

      "It's all past and done with. What's the good of concealing it?... I
      certainly took it. What are you staring at me like that for? Wait for the
      sequel. It's a complete novel, the sickness of a soul! Two months passed
      by. One night I came home drunk, in a wicked mood.... I turned on the
      light and saw Sophia Mikhailovna sitting on my sofa, drunk too, wandering
      a bit, with something savage in her face as if she had just escaped from
      the mad-house. 'Give me my money back,' she said. 'I've changed my mind.
      If I'm going to the dogs, I want to go madly, passionately. Make haste,
      you scoundrel, give me the money.' How indecent it was!"
    

      "And you ... did you give it her?"
    

      "I remember I gave her ten roubles."
    

      "Oh ... is it possible?" Usielkov frowned. "If you couldn't do it
      yourself, or you didn't want to, you could have written to me.... And I
      didn't know ... I didn't know."
    

      "My dear man, why should I write, when she wrote herself afterwards when
      she was in hospital?"
    

      "I was so taken up with the new marriage that I paid no attention to
      letters.... But you were an outsider; you had no antagonism to Sophia
      Mikhailovna.... Why didn't you help her?"
    

      "We can't judge by our present standards, Boris Pietrovich. Now we think
      in this way; but then we thought quite differently.... Now I might perhaps
      give her a thousand roubles; but then even ten roubles ... she didn't get
      them for nothing. It's a terrible story. It's time to forget.... But here
      you are!"
    

      The sledge stopped at the churchyard gate. Usielkov and Shapkin got out of
      the sledge, went through the gate and walked along a long, broad avenue.
      The bare cherry trees, the acacias, the grey crosses and monuments
      sparkled with hoar-frost. In each flake of snow the bright sunny day was
      reflected. There was the smell you find in all cemeteries of incense and
      fresh-dug earth.
    

      "You have a beautiful cemetery," said Usielkov. "It's almost an orchard."
    

      "Yes, but it's a pity the thieves steal the monuments. Look, there, behind
      that cast-iron memorial, on the right, Sophia Mikhailovna is buried. Would
      you like to see?"
    

      The friends turned to the right, stepping in deep snow towards the
      cast-iron memorial.
    

      "Down here," said Shapkin, pointing to a little stone of white marble.
      "Some subaltern or other put up the monument on her grave." Usielkov
      slowly took off his hat and showed his bald pate to the snow. Eying him,
      Shapkin also took off his hat, and another baldness shone beneath the sun.
      The silence round about was like the tomb, as though the air were dead,
      too. The friends looked at the stone, silent, thinking.
    

      "She is asleep!" Shapkin broke the silence. "And she cares very little
      that she took the guilt upon herself and drank cognac. Confess, Boris
      Pietrovich!"
    

      "What?" asked Usielkov, sternly.
    

      "That, however loathsome the past may be, it's better than this." And
      Shapkin pointed to his grey hairs.
    

      "In the old days I did not even think of death.... If I'd met her, I would
      have circumvented her, but now ... well, now!"
    

      Sadness took hold of Usielkov. Suddenly he wanted to cry, passionately, as
      he once desired to love.... And he felt that these tears would be
      exquisite, refreshing. Moisture came out of his eyes and a lump rose in
      his throat, but.... Shapkin was standing by his side, and Usielkov felt
      ashamed of his weakness before a witness. He turned back quickly and
      walked towards the church.
    

      Two hours later, having arranged with the churchwarden and examined the
      church, he seized the opportunity while Shapkin was talking away to the
      priest, and ran to shed a tear. He walked to the stone surreptitiously,
      with stealthy steps, looking round all the time. The little white monument
      stared at him absently, so sadly and innocently, as though a girl and not
      a wanton divorcÃ©e were beneath.
    

      "If I could weep, could weep!" thought Usielkov.
    

      But the moment for weeping had been lost. Though the old man managed to
      make his eyes shine, and tried to bring himself to the right pitch, the
      tears did not flow and the lump did not rise in his throat.... After
      waiting for about ten minutes, Usielkov waved his arm and went to look for
+      Shapkin.
