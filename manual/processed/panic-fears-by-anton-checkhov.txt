PANIC FEARS
    

DURING all the
      years I have been living in this world I have only three times been
      terrified.
    

      The first real terror, which made my hair stand on end and made shivers
      run all over me, was caused by a trivial but strange phenomenon. It
      happened that, having nothing to do one July evening, I drove to the
      station for the newspapers. It was a still, warm, almost sultry evening,
      like all those monotonous evenings in July which, when once they have set
      in, go on for a week, a fortnight, or sometimes longer, in regular
      unbroken succession, and are suddenly cut short by a violent thunderstorm
      and a lavish downpour of rain that refreshes everything for a long time.
    

      The sun had set some time before, and an unbroken gray dusk lay all over
      the land. The mawkishly sweet scents of the grass and flowers were heavy
      in the motionless, stagnant air.
    

      I was driving in a rough trolley. Behind my back the gardener’s son
      Pashka, a boy of eight years old, whom I had taken with me to look after
      the horse in case of necessity, was gently snoring, with his head on a
      sack of oats. Our way lay along a narrow by-road, straight as a ruler,
      which lay hid like a great snake in the tall thick rye. There was a pale
      light from the afterglow of sunset; a streak of light cut its way through
      a narrow, uncouth-looking cloud, which seemed sometimes like a boat and
      sometimes like a man wrapped in a quilt....
    

      I had driven a mile and a half, or two miles, when against the pale
      background of the evening glow there came into sight one after another
      some graceful tall poplars; a river glimmered beyond them, and a gorgeous
      picture suddenly, as though by magic, lay stretched before me. I had to
      stop the horse, for our straight road broke off abruptly and ran down a
      steep incline overgrown with bushes. We were standing on the hillside and
      beneath us at the bottom lay a huge hole full of twilight, of fantastic
      shapes, and of space. At the bottom of this hole, in a wide plain guarded
      by the poplars and caressed by the gleaming river, nestled a village. It
      was now sleeping.... Its huts, its church with the belfry, its trees,
      stood out against the gray twilight and were reflected darkly in the
      smooth surface of the river.
    

      I waked Pashka for fear he should fall out and began cautiously going
      down.
    

      “Have we got to Lukovo?” asked Pashka, lifting his head
      lazily.
    

      “Yes. Hold the reins!...”
    

      I led the horse down the hill and looked at the village. At the first
      glance one strange circumstance caught my attention: at the very top of
      the belfry, in the tiny window between the cupola and the bells, a light
      was twinkling. This light was like that of a smoldering lamp, at one
      moment dying down, at another flickering up. What could it come from?
    

      Its source was beyond my comprehension. It could not be burning at the
      window, for there were neither ikons nor lamps in the top turret of the
      belfry; there was nothing there, as I knew, but beams, dust, and spiders’
      webs. It was hard to climb up into that turret, for the passage to it from
      the belfry was closely blocked up.
    

      It was more likely than anything else to be the reflection of some outside
      light, but though I strained my eyes to the utmost, I could not see one
      other speck of light in the vast expanse that lay before me. There was no
      moon. The pale and, by now, quite dim streak of the afterglow could not
      have been reflected, for the window looked not to the west, but to the
      east. These and other similar considerations were straying through my mind
      all the while that I was going down the slope with the horse. At the
      bottom I sat down by the roadside and looked again at the light. As before
      it was glimmering and flaring up.
    

      “Strange,” I thought, lost in conjecture. “Very strange.”
    

      And little by little I was overcome by an unpleasant feeling. At first I
      thought that this was vexation at not being able to explain a simple
      phenomenon; but afterwards, when I suddenly turned away from the light in
      horror and caught hold of Pashka with one hand, it became clear that I was
      overcome with terror....
    

      I was seized with a feeling of loneliness, misery, and horror, as though I
      had been flung down against my will into this great hole full of shadows,
      where I was standing all alone with the belfry looking at me with its red
      eye.
    

      “Pashka!” I cried, closing my eyes in horror.
    

      “Well?”
    

      “Pashka, what’s that gleaming on the belfry?”
    

      Pashka looked over my shoulder at the belfry and gave a yawn.
    

      “Who can tell?”
    

      This brief conversation with the boy reassured me for a little, but not
      for long. Pashka, seeing my uneasiness, fastened his big eyes upon the
      light, looked at me again, then again at the light....
    

      “I am frightened,” he whispered.
    

      At this point, beside myself with terror, I clutched the boy with one
      hand, huddled up to him, and gave the horse a violent lash.
    

      “It’s stupid!” I said to myself. “That phenomenon
      is only terrible because I don’t understand it; everything we don’t
      understand is mysterious.”
    

      I tried to persuade myself, but at the same time I did not leave off
      lashing the horse. When we reached the posting station I purposely stayed
      for a full hour chatting with the overseer, and read through two or three
      newspapers, but the feeling of uneasiness did not leave me. On the way
      back the light was not to be seen, but on the other hand the silhouettes
      of the huts, of the poplars, and of the hill up which I had to drive,
      seemed to me as though animated. And why the light was there I don’t
      know to this day.
    

      The second terror I experienced was excited by a circumstance no less
      trivial.... I was returning from a romantic interview. It was one o’clock
      at night, the time when nature is buried in the soundest, sweetest sleep
      before the dawn. That time nature was not sleeping, and one could not call
      the night a still one. Corncrakes, quails, nightingales, and woodcocks
      were calling, crickets and grasshoppers were chirruping. There was a light
      mist over the grass, and clouds were scurrying straight ahead across the
      sky near the moon. Nature was awake, as though afraid of missing the best
      moments of her life.
    

      I walked along a narrow path at the very edge of a railway embankment. The
      moonlight glided over the lines which were already covered with dew. Great
      shadows from the clouds kept flitting over the embankment. Far ahead, a
      dim green light was glimmering peacefully.
    

      “So everything is well,” I thought, looking at them.
    

      I had a quiet, peaceful, comfortable feeling in my heart. I was returning
      from a tryst, I had no need to hurry; I was not sleepy, and I was
      conscious of youth and health in every sigh, every step I took, rousing a
      dull echo in the monotonous hum of the night. I don’t know what I
      was feeling then, but I remember I was happy, very happy.
    

      I had gone not more than three-quarters of a mile when I suddenly heard
      behind me a monotonous sound, a rumbling, rather like the roar of a great
      stream. It grew louder and louder every second, and sounded nearer and
      nearer. I looked round; a hundred paces from me was the dark copse from
      which I had only just come; there the embankment turned to the right in a
      graceful curve and vanished among the trees. I stood still in perplexity
      and waited. A huge black body appeared at once at the turn, noisily darted
      towards me, and with the swiftness of a bird flew past me along the rails.
      Less than half a minute passed and the blur had vanished, the rumble
      melted away into the noise of the night.
    

      It was an ordinary goods truck. There was nothing peculiar about it in
      itself, but its appearance without an engine and in the night puzzled me.
      Where could it have come from and what force sent it flying so rapidly
      along the rails? Where did it come from and where was it flying to?
    

      If I had been superstitious I should have made up my mind it was a party
      of demons and witches journeying to a devils’ sabbath, and should
      have gone on my way; but as it was, the phenomenon was absolutely
      inexplicable to me. I did not believe my eyes, and was entangled in
      conjectures like a fly in a spider’s web....
    

      I suddenly realized that I was utterly alone on the whole vast plain; that
      the night, which by now seemed inhospitable, was peeping into my face and
      dogging my footsteps; all the sounds, the cries of the birds, the
      whisperings of the trees, seemed sinister, and existing simply to alarm my
      imagination. I dashed on like a madman, and without realizing what I was
      doing I ran, trying to run faster and faster. And at once I heard
      something to which I had paid no attention before: that is, the plaintive
      whining of the telegraph wires.
    

      “This is beyond everything,” I said, trying to shame myself.
      “It’s cowardice! it’s silly!”
    

      But cowardice was stronger than common sense. I only slackened my pace
      when I reached the green light, where I saw a dark signal-box, and near it
      on the embankment the figure of a man, probably the signalman.
    

      “Did you see it?” I asked breathlessly.
    

      “See whom? What?”
    

      “Why, a truck ran by.”
    

      “I saw it,...” the peasant said reluctantly. “It broke
      away from the goods train. There is an incline at the ninetieth mile...;
      the train is dragged uphill. The coupling on the last truck gave way, so
      it broke off and ran back.... There is no catching it now!...”
    

      The strange phenomenon was explained and its fantastic character vanished.
      My panic was over and I was able to go on my way.
    

      My third fright came upon me as I was going home from stand shooting in
      early spring. It was in the dusk of evening. The forest road was covered
      with pools from a recent shower of rain, and the earth squelched under one’s
      feet. The crimson glow of sunset flooded the whole forest, coloring the
      white stems of the birches and the young leaves. I was exhausted and could
      hardly move.
    

      Four or five miles from home, walking along the forest road, I suddenly
      met a big black dog of the water spaniel breed. As he ran by, the dog
      looked intently at me, straight in my face, and ran on.
    

      “A nice dog!” I thought. “Whose is it?”
    

      I looked round. The dog was standing ten paces off with his eyes fixed on
      me. For a minute we scanned each other in silence, then the dog, probably
      flattered by my attention, came slowly up to me and wagged his tail.
    

      I walked on, the dog following me.
    

      “Whose dog can it be?” I kept asking myself. “Where does
      he come from?”
    

      I knew all the country gentry for twenty or thirty miles round, and knew
      all their dogs. Not one of them had a spaniel like that. How did he come
      to be in the depths of the forest, on a track used for nothing but carting
      timber? He could hardly have dropped behind someone passing through, for
      there was nowhere for the gentry to drive to along that road.
    

      I sat down on a stump to rest, and began scrutinizing my companion. He,
      too, sat down, raised his head, and fastened upon me an intent stare. He
      gazed at me without bHlinking. I don’t know whether it was the
      influence of the stillness, the shadows and sounds of the forest, or
      perhaps a result of exhaustion, but I suddenly felt uneasy under the
      steady gaze of his ordinary doggy eyes. I thought of Faust and his
      bulldog, and of the fact that nervous people sometimes when exhausted have
      hallucinations. That was enough to make me get up hurriedly and hurriedly
      walk on. The dog followed me.
    

      “Go away!” I shouted.
    

      The dog probably liked my voice, for he gave a gleeful jump and ran about
      in front of me.
    

      “Go away!” I shouted again.
    

      The dog looked round, stared at me intently, and wagged his tail
      good-humoredly. Evidently my threatening tone amused him. I ought to have
      patted him, but I could not get Faust’s dog out of my head, and the
      feeling of panic grew more and more acute... Darkness was coming on, which
      completed my confusion, and every time the dog ran up to me and hit me
      with his tail, like a coward I shut my eyes. The same thing happened as
      with the light in the belfry and the truck on the railway: I could not
      stand it and rushed away.
    

      At home I found a visitor, an old friend, who, after greeting me, began to
      complain that as he was driving to me he had lost his way in the forest,
      and a splendid valuable dog of his had dropped behind.
