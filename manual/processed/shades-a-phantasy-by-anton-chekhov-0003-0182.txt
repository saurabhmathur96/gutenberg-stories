THE SHADES, A PHANTASY
    

      BY VLADIMIR G. KORLENKO
    

      I
    

A month and two
      days had elapsed since the judges, amid the loud acclaim of the Athenian
      people, had pronounced the death sentence against the philosopher Socrates
      because he had sought to destroy faith in the gods. What the gadfly is to
      the horse Socrates was to Athens. The gadfly stings the horse in order to
      prevent it from dozing off and to keep it moving briskly on its course.
      The philosopher said to the people of Athens:
    

      “I am your gadfly. My sting pricks your conscience and arouses you
      when you are caught napping. Sleep not, sleep not, people of Athens; awake
      and seek the truth!”
    

      The people arose in their exasperation and cruelly demanded to be rid of
      their gadfly.
    

      “Perchance both of his accusers, Meletus and Anytus, are wrong,”
      said the citizens, on leaving the court after sentence had been
      pronounced.
    

      “But after all whither do his doctrines tend? What would he do? He
      has wrought confusion, he overthrows beliefs that have existed since the
      beginning, he speaks of new virtues which must be recognised and sought
      for, he speaks of a Divinity hitherto unknown to us. The blasphemer, he
      deems himself wiser than the gods! No, ‘twere better we remain true
      to the old gods whom we know. They may not always be just, sometimes they
      may flare up in unjust wrath, and they may also be seized with a wanton
      lust for the wives of mortals; but did not our ancestors live with them in
      the peace of their souls, did not our forefathers accomplish their heroic
      deeds with the help of these very gods? And now the faces of the Olympians
      have paled and the old virtue is out of joint. What does it all lead to?
      Should not an end be put to this impious wisdom once for all?”
    

      Thus the citizens of Athens spoke to one another as they left the place,
      and the blue twilight was falling. They had determined to kill the
      restless gadfly in the hope that the countenances of the gods would shine
      again. And yet—before their souls arose the mild figure of the
      singular philosopher. There were some citizens who recalled how
      courageously he had shared their troubles and dangers at PotidÃ¦a; how he
      alone had prevented them from committing the sin of unjustly executing the
      generals after the victory over the ArginusÃ¦e; how he alone had dared to
      raise his voice against the tyrants who had had fifteen hundred people put
      to death, speaking to the people on the market-place concerning shepherds
      and their sheep.
    

      “Is not he a good shepherd,” he asked, “who guards his
      flock and watches over its increase? Or is it the work of the good
      shepherd to reduce the number of his sheep and disperse them, and of the
      good ruler to do the same with his people? Men of Athens, let us
      investigate this question!”
    

      And at this question of the solitary, undefended philosopher, the faces of
      the tyrants paled, while the eyes of the youths kindled with the fire of
      just wrath and indignation.
    

      Thus, when on dispersing after the sentence the Athenians recalled all
      these things of Socrates, their hearts were oppressed with heavy doubt.
    

      “Have we not done a cruel wrong to the son of Sophroniscus?”
    

      But then the good Athenians looked upon the harbour and the sea, and in
      the red glow of the dying day they saw the purple sails of the
      sharp-keeled ship, sent to the Delian festival, shimmering in the distance
      on the blue Pontus. The ship would not return until the expiration of a
      month, and the Athenians recollected that during this time no blood might
      be shed in Athens, whether the blood of the innocent or the guilty. A
      month, moreover, has many days and still more hours. Supposing the son of
      Sophroniscus had been unjustly condemned, who would hinder his escaping
      from the prison, especially since he had numerous friends to help him? Was
      it so difficult for the rich Plato, for Ãschines and others to bribe the
      guards? Then the restless gadfly would flee from Athens to the barbarians
      in Thessaly, or to the Peloponnesus, or, still farther, to Egypt; Athens
      would no longer hear his blasphemous speeches; his death would not weigh
      upon the conscience of the worthy citizens, and so everything would end
      for the best of all.
    

      Thus said many to themselves that evening, while aloud they praised the
      wisdom of the demos and the heliasts. In secret, however, they cherished
      the hope that the restless philosopher would leave Athens, fly from the
      hemlock to the barbarians, and so free the Athenians of his troublesome
      presence and of the pangs of consciences that smote them for inflicting
      death upon an innocent man.
    

      Two and thirty times since that evening had the sun risen from the ocean
      and dipped down into it again. The ship had returned from Delos and lay in
      the harbour with sadly drooping sails, as if ashamed of its native city.
      The moon did not shine in the heavens, the sea heaved under a heavy fog,
      and on the hills lights peered through the obscurity like the eyes of men
      gripped by a sense of guilt.
    

      The stubborn Socrates did not spare the conscience of the good Athenians.
    

      “We part! You go home and I go to death,” he said to the
      judges after the sentence had been pronounced. “I know not, my
      friends, which of us chooses the better lot!”
    

      As the time had approached for the return of the ship, many of the
      citizens had begun to feel uneasy. Must that obstinate fellow really die?
      And they began to appeal to the consciences of Ãschines, PhÃ¦do, and other
      pupils of Socrates, trying to urge them on to further efforts for their
      master.
    

      “Will you permit your teacher to die?” they asked
      reproachfully in biting tones. “Or do you grudge the few coins it
      would take to bribe the guard?”
    

      In vain Crito besought Socrates to take to flight, and complained that the
      public, was upbraiding his disciples with lack of friendship and with
      avarice. The self-willed philosopher refused to gratify his pupils or the
      good people of Athens.
    

      “Let us investigate.” he said. “If it turns out that I
      must flee, I will flee; but if I must die, I will die. Let us remember
      what we once said—the wise man need not fear death, he need fear
      nothing but falsehood. Is it right to abide by the laws we ourselves have
      made so long as they are agreeable to us, and refuse to obey those which
      are disagreeable? If my memory does not deceive me I believe we once spoke
      of these things, did we not?”
    

      “Yes, we did,” answered his pupil.
    

      “And I think all were agreed as to the answer?”
    

      “Yes.”
    

      “But perhaps what is true for others is not true for us?”
    

      “No, truth is alike for all, including ourselves.”
    

      “But perhaps when we must die and not some one else, truth
      becomes untruth?”
    

      “No, Socrates, truth remains the truth under all circumstances.”
    

      After his pupil had thus agreed to each premise of Socrates in turn, he
      smiled and drew his conclusion.
    

      “If that is so, my friend, mustn’t I die? Or has my head
      already become so weak that I am no longer in a condition to draw a
      logical conclusion? Then correct me, my friend and show my erring brain
      the right way.”
    

      His pupil covered his face with his mantle and turned aside.
    

      “Yes,” he said, “now I see you must die.”
    

      And on that evening when the sea tossed hither and thither and roared
      dully under the load of fog, and the whimsical wind in mournful
      astonishment gently stirred the sails of the ships; when the citizens
      meeting on the streets asked one another: “Is he dead?” and
      their voices timidly betrayed the hope that he was not dead; when the
      first breath of awakened conscience, touched the hearts of the Athenians
      like the first messenger of the storm; and when, it seemed the very faces
      of the gods were darkened with shame—on that evening at the sinking
      of the sun the self-willed man drank the cup of death!
    

      The wind increased in violence and shrouded the city more closely in the
      veil of mist, angrily tugging at the sails of the vessels delayed in the
      harbour. And the Erinyes sang their gloomy songs to the hearts of the
      citizens and whipped up in their breasts that tempest which was later, to
      overwhelm the denouncers of Socrates.
    

      But in that hour the first stirrings of regret were still uncertain and
      confused. The citizens found more fault with Socrates than ever because he
      had not given them the satisfaction of fleeing to Thessaly; they were
      annoyed with his pupils because in the last days they had walked about in
      sombre mourning attire, a living reproach to the Athenians; they were
      vexed with the judges because they had not had the sense and the courage
      to resist the blind rage of the excited people; they bore even the gods
      resentment.
    

      “To you, ye gods, have we brought this sacrifice,” spoke many.
      “Rejoice, ye unsatiable!”
    

      “I know not which of us chooses the better lot!”
    

      Those words of Socrates came back to their memory, those his last words to
      the judges and to the people gathered in the court. Now he lay in the
      prison quiet and motionless under his cloak, while over the city hovered
      mourning, horror, and shame.
    

      Again he became the tormentor of the city, he who was himself no longer
      accessible to torment. The gadfly had been killed, but it stung the people
      more sharply than ever—sleep not, sleep not this night, O men of
      Athens! Sleep not! You have committed an injustice, a cruel injustice,
      which can never be erased!
    

      II
    

During those sad
      days Xenophon, the general, a pupil of Socrates, was marching with his Ten
      Thousand in a distant land, amid dangers, seeking a way of return to his
      beloved fatherland.
    

      Ãschines, Crito, Critobulus, PhÃ¦do, and Apollodorus were now occupied with
      the preparations for the modest funeral.
    

      Plato was burning his lamp and bending over a parchment; the best disciple
      of the philosopher was busy inscribing the deeds, words, and teachings
      that marked the end of the sage’s life. A thought is never lost, and
      the truth discovered by a great intellect illumines the way for future
      generations like a torch in the dark.
    

      There was one other disciple of Socrates. Not long before, the impetuous
      Ctesippus had been one of the most frivolous and pleasure-seeking of the
      Athenian youths. He had set up beauty as his sole god, and had bowed
      before Clinias as its highest exemplar. But since he had become acquainted
      with Socrates, all desire for pleasure and all light-mindedness had gone
      from him. He looked on indifferently while others took his place with
      Clinias. The grace of thought and the harmony of spirit that he found in
      Socrates seemed a hundred times more attractive than the graceful form and
      the harmonious features of Clinias. With all the intensity of his stormy
      temperament he hung on the man who had disturbed the serenity of his
      virginal soul, which for the first time opened to doubts as the bud of a
      young oak opens to the fresh winds of spring.
    

      Now that the master was dead, he could find peace neither at his own
      hearth nor in the oppressive stillness of the streets nor among his
      friends and fellow-disciples. The gods of hearth and home and the gods of
      the people inspired him with repugnance.
    

      “I know not,” he said, “whether ye are the best of all
      the gods to whom numerous generations have burned incense and brought
      offerings; all I know is that for your sake the blind mob extinguished the
      clear torch of truth, and for your sake sacrificed the greatest and best
      of mortals!”
    

      It almost seemed to Ctesippus as though the streets and market-places
      still echoed with the shrieking of that unjust sentence. And he remembered
      how it was here that the people clamoured for the execution of the
      generals who had led them to victory against the ArgunisÃ¦, and how
      Socrates alone had opposed the savage sentence of the judges and the blind
      rage of the mob. But when Socrates himself needed a champion, no one had
      been found to defend him with equal strength. Ctesippus blamed himself and
      his friends, and for that reason he wanted to avoid everybody—even
      himself, if possible.
    

      That evening he went to the sea. But his grief grew only the more violent.
      It seemed to him that the mourning daughters of Nereus were tossing hither
      and thither on the shore bewailing the death of the best of the Athenians
      and the folly of the frenzied city. The waves broke on the rocky coast
      with a growl of lament. Their booming sounded like a funeral dirge.
    

      He turned away, left the shore, and went on further without looking before
      him. He forgot time and space and his own ego, filled only with the
      afflicting thought of Socrates!
    

      “Yesterday he still was, yesterday his mild words still could be
      heard. How is it possible that to-day he no longer is? O night, O giant
      mountain shrouded in mist, O heaving sea moved by your own life, O
      restless winds that carry the breath of an immeasurable world on your
      wings, O starry vault flecked with flying clouds—take me to you,
      disclose to me the mystery of this death, if it is revealed to you! And if
      ye know not, then grant my ignorant soul your own lofty indifference.
      Remove from me these torturing questions. I no longer have strength to
      carry them in my bosom without an answer, without even the hope of an
      answer. For who shall answer them, now that the lips of Socrates are
      sealed in eternal silence, and eternal darkness is laid upon his lids?”
    

      Thus Ctesippus cried out to the sea and the mountains, and to the dark
      night, which followed its invariable course, ceaselessly, invisibly, over
      the slumbering world. Many hours passed before Ctesippus glanced up and
      saw whither his steps had unconsciously led him. A dark horror seized his
      soul as he looked about him.
    

      III
    

It seemed as if the
      unknown gods of eternal night had heard his impious prayer. Ctesippus
      looked about, without being able to recognise the place where he was. The
      lights of the city had long been extinguished by the darkness. The roaring
      of the sea had died away in the distance; his anxious soul had even lost
      the recollection of having heard it. No single sound—no mournful cry
      of nocturnal bird, nor whirr of wings, nor rustling of trees, nor murmur
      of a merry stream—broke the deep silence. Only the blind will-o’-the-wisps
      flickered here and there over rocks, and sheet-lightning, unaccompanied by
      any sound, flared up and died down against crag-peaks. This brief
      illumination merely emphasised the darkness; and the dead light disclosed
      the outlines of dead deserts crossed by gorges like crawling serpents, and
      rising into rocky heights in a wild chaos.
    

      All the joyous gods that haunt green groves, purling brooks, and mountain
      valleys seemed to have fled forever from these deserts. Pan alone, the
      great and mysterious Pan, was hiding somewhere nearby in the chaos of
      nature, and with mocking glance seemed to be pursuing the tiny ant that a
      short time before had blasphemously asked to know the secret of the world
      and of death. Dark, senseless horror overwhelmed the soul of Ctesippus. It
      is thus that the sea in stormy floodtide overwhelms a rock on the shore.
    

      Was it a dream, was it reality, or was it the revelation of the unknown
      divinity? Ctesippus felt that in an instant he would step across the
      threshold of life, and that his soul would melt into an ocean of unending,
      inconceivable horror like a drop of rain in the waves of the grey sea on a
      dark and stormy night. But at this moment he suddenly heard voices that
      seemed familiar to him, and in the glare of the sheet-lightning his eyes
      recognised human figures.
    

      IV
    

On a rocky slope
      sat a man in deep despair. He had thrown a cloak over his head and was
      bowed to the ground. Another figure approached him softly, cautiously
      climbing upward and carefully feeling every step. The first man uncovered
      his face and exclaimed:
    

      “Is that you I just now saw, my good Socrates? Is that you passing
      by me in this cheerless place? I have already spent many hours here
      without knowing when day will relieve the night. I have been waiting in
      vain for the dawn.”
    

      “Yes, I am Socrates, my friend, and you, are you not Elpidias who
      died three days before me?”
    

      “Yes, I am Elpidias, formerly the richest tanner in Athens, now the
      most miserable of slaves. For the first time I understand the words of the
      poet: ‘Better to be a slave in this world than a ruler in gloomy
      Hades.’”
    

      “My friend, if it is disagreeable for you where you are, why don’t
      you move to another spot?”
    

      “O Socrates, I marvel at you—how dare you wander about in this
      cheerless gloom? I—I sit here overcome with grief and bemoan the
      joys of a fleeting life.”
    

      “Friend Elpidias, like you, I, too, was plunged in this gloom when
      the light of earthly life was removed from my eyes. But an inner voice
      told me: ‘Tread this new path without hesitation’, and I went.”
    

      “But whither do you go, O son of Sophroniscus? Here there is no way,
      no path, not even a ray of light; nothing but a chaos of rocks, mist, and
      gloom.”
    

      “True. But, my Elpidias, since you are aware of this sad truth, have
      you not asked yourself what is the most distressing thing in your present
      situation?”
    

      “Undoubtedly the dismal darkness.”
    

      “Then one should seek for light. Perchance you will find here the
      great law—that mortals must in darkness seek the source of life. Do
      you not think it is better so to seek than to remain sitting in one spot?
      I think it is, therefore I keep walking. Farewell!”
    

      “Oh, good Socrates, abandon me not! You go with sure steps through
      the pathless chaos in Hades. Hold out to me but a fold of your mantle—”
    

      “If you think it is better for you, too, then follow me, friend
      Elpidias.”
    

      And the two shades walked on, while the soul of Ctesippus, released by
      sleep from its mortal envelop, flew after them, greedily absorbing the
      tones of the clear Socratic speech.
    

      “Are you here, good Socrates?” the voice of the Athenian again
      was heard. “Why are you silent? Converse shortens the way, and I
      swear, by Hercules, never did I have to traverse such a horrid way.”
    

      “Put questions, friend Elpidias! The question of one who seeks
      knowledge brings forth answers and produces conversation.”
    

      Elpidias maintained silence for a moment, and then, after he had collected
      his thoughts, asked:
    

      “Yes, this is what I wanted to say—tell me, my poor Socrates,
      did they at least give you a good burial?”
    

      “I must confess, friend Elpidias, I cannot satisfy your curiosity.”
    

      “I understand, my poor Socrates, it doesn’t help you cut a
      figure. Now with me it was so different! Oh, how they buried me, how
      magnificently they buried me, my poor fellow-Wanderer! I still think with
      great pleasure of those lovely moments after my death. First they washed
      me and sprinkled me with well-smelling balsam. Then my faithful Larissa
      dressed me in garments of the finest weave. The best mourning-women of the
      city tore their hair from their heads because they had been promised good
      pay, and in the family vault they placed an amphora—a crater with
      beautiful, decorated handles of bronze, and, besides, a vial.—”
    

      “Stay, friend Elpidias. I am convinced that the faithful Larissa
      converted her love into several minas. Yet—”
    

      “Exactly ten minas and four drachmas, not counting the drinks for
      the guests. I hardly think that the richest tanner can come before the
      souls of his ancestors and boast of such respect on the part of the
      living.”
    

      “Friend Elpidias, don’t you think that money would have been
      of more use to the poor people who are still alive in Athens than to you
      at this moment?”
    

      “Admit, Socrates, you are speaking in envy,” responded
      Elpidias, pained. “I am sorry for you, unfortunate Socrates,
      although, between ourselves, you really deserved your fate. I myself in
      the family circle said more than once that an end ought to be put to your
      impious doings, because—”
    

      “Stay, friend, I thought you wanted to draw a conclusion, and I fear
      you are straying from the straight path. Tell me, my good friend, whither
      does your wavering thought tend?”
    

      “I wanted to say that in my goodness I am sorry for you. A month ago
      I myself spoke against you in the assembly, but truly none of us who
      shouted so loud wanted such a great ill to befall you. Believe me, now I
      am all the sorrier for you, unhappy philosopher!”
    

      “I thank you. But tell me, my friend, do you perceive a brightness
      before your eyes?”
    

      “No, on the contrary such darkness lies before me that I must ask
      myself whether this is not the misty region of Orcus.”
    

      “This way, therefore, is just as dark for you as for me?”
    

      “Quite right.”
    

      “If I am not mistaken, you are even holding on to the folds of my
      cloak?”
    

      “Also true.”
    

      “Then we are in the same position? You see your ancestors are not
      hastening to rejoice in the tale of your pompous burial. Where is the
      difference between us, my good friend?”
    

      “But, Socrates, have the gods enveloped your reason in such
      obscurity that the difference is not clear to you?”
    

      “Friend, if your situation is clearer to you, then give me your hand
      and lead me, for I swear, by the dog, you let me go ahead in this
      darkness.”
    

      “Cease your scoffing, Socrates! Do not make sport, and do not
      compare yourself, your godless self, with a man who died in his own bed——“.
    

      “Ah, I believe I am beginning to understand you. But tell me,
      Elpidias, do you hope ever again to rejoice in your bed?”
    

      “Oh, I think not.”
    

      “And was there ever a time when you did not sleep in it?”
    

      “Yes. That was before I bought goods from Agesilaus at half their
      value. You see, that Agesilaus is really a deep-dyed rogue——”
    

      “Ah, never mind about Agesilaus! Perhaps he is getting them back,
      from your widow at a quarter their value. Then wasn’t I right when I
      said that you were in possession of your bed only part of the time?”
    

      “Yes, you were right.”
    

      “Well, and I, too, was in possession of the bed in which I died part
      of the time. Proteus, the good guard of the prison, lent it to me for a
      period.”
    

      “Oh, if I had known what you were aiming at with your talk, I wouldn’t
      have answered your wily questions. By Hercules, such profanation is
      unheard of—he compares himself with me! Why, I could put an end to
      you with two words, if it came to it——”
    

      “Say them, Elpidias, without fear. Words can scarcely be more
      destructive to me than the hemlock.”
    

      “Well, then, that is just what I wanted to say. You unfortunate man,
      you died by the sentence of the court and had to drink hemlock!”
    

      “But I have known that since the day of my death, even long before.
      And you, unfortunate Elpidias, tell me what caused your death?”
    

      “Oh, with me, it was different, entirely different! You see I got
      the dropsy in my abdomen. An expensive physician from Corinth was called
      who promised to cure me for two minas, and he was given half that amount
      in advance. I am afraid that Larissa in her lack of experience in such
      things gave him the other half, too——”
    

      “Then the physician did not keep his promise?”
    

      “That’s it.”
    

      “And you died from dropsy?”
    

      “Ah, Socrates, believe me, three times it wanted to vanquish me, and
      finally it quenched the flame of my life!”
    

      “Then tell me—did death by dropsy give you great pleasure?”
    

      “Oh, wicked Socrates, don’t make sport of me. I told you it
      wanted to vanquish me three times. I bellowed like a steer under the knife
      of the slaughterer, and begged the ParcÃ¦ to cut the thread of my life as
      quickly as possible.”
    

      “That doesn’t surprise me. But from what do you conclude that
      the dropsy was pleasanter to you than the hemlock to me? The hemlock made
      an end of me in a moment.”
    

      “I see, I fell into your snare again, you crafty sinner! I won’t
      enrage the gods still more by speaking with you, you destroyer of sacred
      customs.”
    

      Both were silent, and quiet reigned. But in a short while Elpidias was
      again the first to begin a conversation.
    

      “Why are you silent, good Socrates?”
    

      “My friend; didn’t you yourself ask for silence?”
    

      “I am not proud, and I can treat men who are worse than I am
      considerately. Don’t let us quarrel.”
    

      “I did not quarrel with you, friend Elpidias, and did not wish to
      say anything to insult you. I am merely accustomed to get at the truth of
      things by comparisons. My situation is not clear to me. You consider your
      situation better, and I should be glad to learn why. On the other hand, it
      would not hurt you to learn the truth, whatever shape it may take.”
    

      “Well, no more of this.”
    

      “Tell me, are you afraid? I don’t think that the feeling I now
      have can be called fear.”
    

      “I am afraid, although I have less cause than you to be at odds with
      the gods. But don’t you think that the gods, in abandoning us to
      ourselves here in this chaos, have cheated us of our hopes?”
    

      “That depends upon what sort of hopes they were. What did you expect
      from the gods, Elpidias?”
    

      “Well, well, what did I expect from the gods! What curious questions
      you ask, Socrates! If a man throughout life brings offerings, and at his
      death passes away with a pious heart and with all that custom demands, the
      gods might at least send some one to meet him, at least one of the
      inferior gods, to show a man the way. ... But that reminds me. Many a time
      when I begged for good luck in traffic in hides, I promised Hermes calves——”
    

      “And you didn’t have luck?”
    

      “Oh, yes, I had luck, good Socrates, but——“.
    

      “I understand, you had no calf.”
    

      “Bah! Socrates, a rich tanner and not have calves?”
    

      “Now I understand. You had luck, had calves, but you kept them for
      yourself, and Hermes received nothing.”
    

      “You’re a clever man. I’ve often said so. I kept only
      three of my ten oaths, and I didn’t deal differently with the other
      gods. If the same is the case with you, isn’t that the reason,
      possibly, why we are now abandoned by the gods? To be sure, I ordered
      Larissa to sacrifice a whole hecatomb after my death.”
    

      “But that is Larissa’s affair, whereas it was you, friend
      Elpidias, who made the promises.”
    

      “That’s true, that’s true. But you, good Socrates, could
      you, godless as you are, deal better with the gods than I who was a
      god-fearing tanner?”
    

      “My friend, I know not whether I dealt better or worse. At first I
      brought offerings without having made vows. Later I offered neither calves
      nor vows.”
    

      “What, not a single calf, you unfortunate man?”
    

      “Yes, friend, if Hermes had had to live by my gifts, I am afraid he
      would have grown very thin.”
    

      “I understand. You did not traffic in cattle, so you offered
      articles of some other trade—probably a mina or so of what the
      pupils paid you.”
    

      “You know, my friend, I didn’t ask pay of my pupils, and my
      trade scarcely sufficed to support me. If the gods reckoned on the sorry
      remnants of my meals they miscalculated.”
    

      “Oh, blasphemer, in comparison with you I can be proud of my piety.
      Ye gods, look upon this man! I did deceive you at times, but now and then
      I shared with you the surplus of some fortunate deal. He who gives at all
      gives much in comparison with a blasphemer who gives nothing. Socrates, I
      think you had better go on alone! I fear that your company, godless one,
      damages me in the eyes of the gods.”
    

      “As you will, good Elpidias. I swear by the dog no one shall force
      his company on another. Unhand the fold of my mantle, and farewell. I will
      go on alone.”
    

      And Socrates walked forward with a sure tread, feeling the ground,
      however, at every step.
    

      But Elpidias behind him instantly cried out:
    

      “Wait, wait, my good fellow-citizen, do not leave an Athenian alone
      in this horrible place! I was only making fun. Take what I said as a joke,
      and don’t go so quickly. I marvel how you can see a thing in this
      hellish darkness.”
    

      “Friend, I have accustomed my eyes to it.”
    

      “That’s good. Still I, can’t approve of your not having
      brought sacrifices to the gods. No, I can’t, poor Socrates, I can’t.
      The honourable Sophroniscus certainly taught you better in your youth, and
      you yourself used to take part in the prayers. I saw you.”
    

      “Yes. But I am accustomed to examine all our motives and to accept
      only those that after investigation prove to be reasonable. And so a day
      came on which I said to myself: ‘Socrates, here you are praying to
      the Olympians. Why are you praying to them?’”
    

      Elpidias laughed.
    

      “Really you philosophers sometimes don’t know how to answer
      the simplest questions. I’m a plain tanner who never in my life
      studied sophistry, yet I know why I must honour the Olympians.”
    

      “Tell me quickly, so that I, too, may know why.”
    

      “Why? Ha! Ha! It’s too simple, you wise Socrates.”
    

      “So much the better if it’s simple. But don’t keep your
      wisdom from me. Tell me—why must one honour the gods?”
    

      “Why. Because everybody does it.”
    

      “Friend, you know very well that not every one honours the gods.
      Wouldn’t it be more correct to say ‘many’?”
    

      “Very well, many.”
    

      “But tell me, don’t more men deal wickedly than righteously?”
    

      “I think so. You find more wicked people than good people.”
    

      “Therefore, if you follow the majority, you ought to deal wickedly
      and not righteously?”
    

      “What are you saying?”
    

      “I’m not saying it, you are. But I think the
      reason that men reverence the Olympians is not because the majority
      worship them. We must find another, more rational ground. Perhaps you mean
      they deserve reverence?”
    

      “Yes, very right.”
    

      “Good. But then arises a new question: Why do they deserve
      reverence?”
    

      “Because of their greatness.”
    

      “Ah, that’s more like it. Perhaps I will soon be agreeing with
      you. It only remains for you to tell me wherein their greatness consists.
      That’s a difficult question, isn’t it? Let us seek the answer
      together. Homer says that the impetuous Ares, when stretched flat on the
      ground by a stone thrown by Pallas Athene, covered with his body the space
      that can be travelled in seven mornings. You see what an enormous space.”
    

      “Is that wherein greatness consists?”
    

      “There you have me, my friend. That raises another question. Do you
      remember the athlete Theophantes? He towered over the people a whole head’s
      length, whereas Pericles was no larger than you. But whom do we call
      great, Pericles or Theophantes?”
    

      “I see that greatness does not consist in size of body. In that you’re
      right. I am glad we agree. Perhaps greatness consists in virtue?”
    

      “Certainly.”
    

      “I think so, too.”
    

      “Well, then, who must bow to whom? The small before the large, or
      those who are great in virtues before the wicked?”
    

      “The answer is clear.”
    

      “I think so, too. Now we will look further into this matter. Tell me
      truly, did you ever kill other people’s children with arrows?”
    

      “It goes without saying, never! Do you think so ill of me?”
    

      “Nor have you, I trust, ever seduced the wives of other men?”
    

      “I was an upright tanner and a good husband. Don’t forget
      that, Socrates, I beg of you!”
    

      “You never became a brute, nor by your lustfulness gave your
      faithful Larissa occasion to revenge herself on women whom you had ruined
      and on their innocent children?”
    

      “You anger me, really, Socrates.”
    

      “But perhaps you snatched your inheritance from your father and
      threw him into prison?”
    

      “Never! Why these insulting questions?”
    

      “Wait, my friend. Perhaps we will both reach a conclusion. Tell me,
      would you have considered a man great who had done all these things of
      which I have spoken?”
    

      “No, no, no! I should have called such a man a scoundrel, and lodged
      public complaint against him with the judges in the market-place.”
    

      “Well, Elpidias, why did you not complain in the market-place
      against Zeus and the Olympians? The son of Cronos carried on war with his
      own father, and was seized with brutal lust for the daughters of men,
      while Hera took vengeance upon innocent virgins. Did not both of them
      convert the unhappy daughter of Inachos into a common cow? Did not Apollo
      kill all the children of Niobe with his arrows? Did not Callenius steal
      bulls? Well, then, Elpidias, if it is true that he who has less virtue
      must do honour to him who has more, then you should not build altars to
      the Olympians, but they to you.”
    

      “Blaspheme not, impious Socrates! Keep quiet! How dare you judge the
      acts of the gods?”
    

      “Friend, a higher power has judged them. Let us investigate the
      question. What is the mark of divinity? I think you said, Greatness, which
      consists in virtue. Now is not this greatness the one divine spark in man?
      But if we test the greatness of the gods by our small human virtues, and
      it turns out that that which measures is greater than that which is
      measured, then it follows that the divine principle itself condemns the
      Olympians. But, then—”
    

      “What, then?”
    

      “Then, friend Elpidias, they are no gods, but deceptive phantoms,
      creations of a dream. Is it not so?”
    

      “Ah, that’s whither your talk leads, you bare-footed
      philosopher! Now I see what they said of you is true. You are like that
      fish that takes men captive with its look. So you took me captive in order
      to confound my believing soul and awaken doubt in it. It was already
      beginning to waver in its reverence for Zeus. Speak alone. I won’t
      answer any more.”
    

      “Be not wrathful, Elpidias! I don’t wish to inflict any evil
      upon you. But if you are tired of following my arguments to their logical
      conclusions, permit me to relate to you an allegory of a Milesian youth.
      Allegories rest the mind, and the relaxation is not unprofitable.”
    

      “Speak, if your story is not too long and its purpose is good.”
    

      “Its purpose is truth, friend Elpidias, and I will be brief. Once,
      you know, in ancient times, Miletus was exposed to the attacks of the
      barbarians. Among the youth who were seized was a son of the wisest and
      best of all the citizens in the land. His precious child was overtaken by
      a severe illness and became unconscious. He was abandoned and allowed to
      lie like worthless booty. In the dead of night he came to his senses. High
      above him glimmered the stars. Round about stretched the desert; and in
      the distance he heard the howl of beasts of prey. He was alone.
    

      “He was entirely alone, and, besides that, the gods had taken from
      him the recollection of his former life. In vain he racked his brain—it
      was as dark and empty as the inhospitable desert in which he found
      himself. But somewhere, far away, behind the misty and obscure figures
      conjured up by his reason, loomed the thought of his lost home, and a
      vague realisation of the figure of the best of all men; and in his heart
      resounded the word ‘father.’ Doesn’t it seem to you that
      the fate of this youth resembles the fate of all humanity?”
    

      “How so?”
    

      “Do we not all awake to life on earth with a hazy recollection of
      another home? And does not the figure of the great unknown hover before
      our souls?”
    

      “Continue, Socrates, I am listening.”
    

      “The youth revived, arose, and walked cautiously, seeking to avoid
      all dangers. When after long wanderings his strength was nearly gone, he
      discerned a fire in the misty distance which illumined the darkness and
      banished the cold. A faint hope crept into his weary soul, and the
      recollections of his father’s house again awoke within him. The
      youth walked toward the light, and cried: ‘It is you, my father, it
      is you!’
    

      “And was it his father’s house?”
    

      “No, it was merely a night lodging of wild nomads. So for many years
      he led the miserable life of a captive slave, and only in his dreams saw
      the distant home and rested on his father’s bosom. Sometimes with
      weak hand he endeavoured to lure from dead clay or wood or stone the face
      and form that ever hovered before him. There even came moments when he
      grew weary and embraced his own handiwork and prayed to it and wet it with
      his tears. But the stone remained cold stone. And as he waxed in years the
      youth destroyed his creations, which already seemed to him a vile
      defamation of his ever-present dreams. At last fate brought him to a good
      barbarian, who asked him for the cause of his constant mourning. When the
      youth, confided to him the hopes and longings of his soul, the barbarian,
      a wise man, said:
    

      “‘The world would be better did such a man and such a country
      exist as that of which you speak. But by what mark would you recognise
      your father?’
    

      “‘In my country,’ answered the youth, ‘they
      reverenced wisdom and virtue and looked up to my father as to the master.’
    

      “‘Well and good,’ answered the barbarian. ‘I must
      assume that a kernel of your father’s teaching resides in you.
      Therefore take up the wanderer’s staff, and proceed on your way.
      Seek perfect wisdom and truth, and when you have found them, cast aside
      your staff—there will be your home and your father.’
    

      “And the youth went on his way at break of day—”
    

      “Did he find the one whom he sought?”
    

      “He is still seeking. Many countries, cities and men has he seen. He
      has come to know all the ways by land; he has traversed the stormy seas;
      he has searched the courses of the stars in heaven by which a pilgrim can
      direct his course in the limitless deserts. And each time that on his
      wearisome way an inviting fire lighted up the darkness before his eyes,
      his heart beat faster and hope crept into his soul. 'That is my father’s
      hospitable house,’ he thought.
    

      “And when a hospitable host would greet the tired traveller and
      offer him the peace and blessing of his hearth, the youth would fall at
      his feet and say with emotion: ‘I thank you, my father! Do you not
      recognise your son?’
    

      “And many were prepared to take him as their son, for at that time
      children were frequently kidnapped. But after the first glow of
      enthusiasm, the youth would detect traces of imperfection, sometimes even
      of wickedness. Then he would begin to investigate and to test his host
      with questions concerning justice and injustice. And soon he would be
      driven forth again upon the cold wearisome way. More than once he said to
      himself: ‘I will remain at this last hearth, I will preserve my last
      belief. It shall be the home of my father.’”
    

      “Do you know, Socrates, perhaps that would have been the most
      sensible thing to do.”
    

      “So he thought sometimes. But the habit of investigating, the
      confused dream of a father, gave him no peace. Again and again he shook
      the dust from his feet; again and again he grasped his staff. Not a few
      stormy nights found him shelterless. Doesn’t it seem to you that the
      fate of this youth resembles the fate of mankind?”
    

      “Why?”
    

      “Does not the race of man make trial of its childish belief and
      doubt it while seeking the unknown? Doesn’t it fashion the form of
      its father in wood, stone, custom, and tradition? And then man finds the
      form imperfect, destroys it, and again goes on his wanderings in the
      desert of doubt. Always for the purpose of seeking something better—”
    

      “Oh, you cunning sage, now I understand the purpose of your
      allegory! And I will tell you to your face that if only a ray of light
      were to penetrate this gloom, I would not put the Lord on trial with
      unnecessary questions—”
    

      “Friend, the light is already shining,” answered Socrates.
    

      V
    

It seemed as if the
      words of the philosopher had taken effect. High up in the distance a beam
      of light penetrated a vapoury envelop and disappeared in the mountains. It
      was followed by a second and a third. There beyond the darkness luminous
      genii seemed to be hovering, and a great mystery seemed about to be
      revealed, as if the breath of life were blowing, as if some great ceremony
      were in process. But it was still very remote. The shades descended
      thicker and thicker; foggy clouds rolled into masses, separated, and
      chased one another endlessly, ceaselessly.
    

      A blue light from a distant peak fell upon a deep ravine; the clouds rose
      and covered the heavens to the zenith.
    

      The rays disappeared and withdrew to a greater and greater distance, as if
      fleeing from this vale of shades and horrors. Socrates stood and looked
      after them sadly. Elpidias peered up at the peak full of dread.
    

      “Look, Socrates! What do you see there on the mountain?”
    

      “Friend,” answered; the philosopher, “let us investigate
      our situation. Since we are in motion, we must arrive somewhere, and since
      earthly existence must have a limit, I believe that this limit is to be
      found at the parting of two beginnings. In the struggle of light with
      darkness we attain the crown of our endeavours. Since the ability to think
      has not been taken from us, I believe that it is the will of the divine
      being who called our power of thinking into existence that we should
      investigate the goal of our endeavours ourselves. Therefore, Elpidias, let
      us in dignified manner go to meet the dawn that lies beyond those clouds.”
    

      “Oh, my friend! If that is the dawn, I would rather the long
      cheerless night had endured forever, for it was quiet and peaceful. Don’t
      you think our time passed tolerably well in instructive converse? And now
      my soul trembles before the tempest drawing nigh. Say what you will, but
      there before us are no ordinary shades of the dead night.”
    

      Zeus hurled a bolt into the bottomless gulf.
    

      Ctesippus looked up to the peak, and his soul was frozen with horror. Huge
      sombre figures of the Olympian gods crowded on the mountain in a circle. A
      last ray shot through the region of clouds and mists, and died away like a
      faint memory. A storm was approaching now, and the powers of night were
      once more in the ascendant. Dark figures covered the heavens. In the
      centre Ctesippus could discern the all-powerful son of Cronos surrounded
      by a halo. The sombre figures of the older gods encircled him in wrathful
      excitement. Like flocks of birds winging their way in the twilight, like
      eddies of dust driven by a hurricane, like autumn leaves lashed by Boreas,
      numerous minor gods hovered in long clouds and occupied the spaces.
    

      When the clouds gradually lifted from the peak and sent down dismal horror
      to embrace the earth, Ctesippus fell upon his knees. Later, he admitted
      that in this dreadful moment he forgot all his master’s deductions
      and conclusions. His courage failed him; and terror took possession of his
      soul.
    

      He merely listened.
    

      Two voices resounded there where before had been silence, the one the
      mighty and threatening voice of the Godhead, the other the weak voice of a
      mortal which the wind carried from the mountain slope to the spot where
      Ctesippus had left Socrates.
    

      “Are you,” thus spake the voice from the clouds, “are
      you the blasphemous Socrates who strives with the gods of heaven and
      earth? Once there were none so joyous, so immortal, as we. Now, for long
      we have passed our days in darkness because of the unbelief and doubt that
      have come upon earth. Never has the mist closed in on us so heavily as
      since the time your voice resounded in Athens, the city we once so dearly
      loved. Why did you not follow the commands of your father, Sophroniscus?
      The good man permitted himself a few little sins, especially in his youth,
      yet by way of recompense, we frequently enjoyed the smell of his offerings—”
    

      “Stay, son of Cronos, and solve my doubts! Do I understand that you
      prefer cowardly hypocrisy to searchings for the truth?”
    

      At this question the crags trembled with the shock of a thundering peal.
      The first breath of the tempest scattered in the distant gorges. But the
      mountains still trembled, for he who was enthroned upon them still
      trembled. And in the anxious quiet of the night only distant sighs could
      be heard.
    

      In the very bowels of the earth the chained Titans seemed to be groaning
      under the blow of the son of Cronos.
    

      “Where are you now, you impious questioner?” suddenly came the
      mocking voice of the Olympian.
    

      “I am here, son of Cronos, on the same spot. Nothing but your answer
      can move me from it. I am waiting.”
    

      Thunder bellowed in the clouds like a wild animal amazed at the daring of
      a Lybian tamer’s fearless approach. At the end of a few moments the
      Voice again rolled over the spaces:
    

      “Son of Sophroniscus! Is it not enough that you bred so much
      scepticism on earth that the clouds of your doubt reached even to Olympus?
      Indeed, many a time when you were carrying on your discourse in the
      market-places or in the academies or on the promenades, it seemed to me as
      if you had already destroyed all the altars on earth, and the dust were
      rising from them up to us here on the mountain. Even that is not enough!
      Here before my very face you will not recognise the power of the immortals—”
    

      “Zeus, thou art wrathful. Tell me, who gave me the ‘Daemon’
      which spoke to my soul throughout my life and forced me to seek the truth
      without resting?”
    

      Mysterious silence reigned in the clouds.
    

      “Was it not you? You are silent? Then I will investigate the matter.
      Either this divine beginning emanates from you or from some one else. If
      from you, I bring it to you as an offering. I offer you the ripe fruit of
      my life, the flame of the spark of your own kindling! See, son of Cronos,
      I preserved my gift; in my deepest heart grew the seed that you sowed. It
      is the very fire of my soul. It burned in those crises when with my own
      hand I tore the thread of life. Why will you not accept it? Would you have
      me regard you as a poor master whose age prevents him from seeing that his
      own pupil obediently follows out his commands? Who are you that would
      command me to stifle the flame that has illuminated my whole life, ever
      since it was penetrated by the first ray of sacred thought? The sun says
      not to the stars: ‘Be extinguished that I may rise.’ The sun
      rises and the weak glimmer of the stars is quenched by its far, far
      stronger light. The day says not to the torch: ‘Be extinguished; you
      interfere with me.’ The day breaks, and the torch smokes, but no
      longer shines. The divinity that I am questing is not you who are afraid
      of doubt. That divinity is like the day, like the sun, and shines without
      extinguishing other lights. The god I seek is the god who would say to me:
      ‘Wanderer, give me your torch, you no longer need it, for I am the
      source of all light. Searcher for truth, set upon my altar the little gift
      of your doubt, because in me is its solution.’ If you are that god,
      harken to my questions. No one kills his own child, and my doubts are a
      branch of the eternal spirit whose name is truth.”
    

      Round about, the fires of heaven tore the dark clouds, and out of the
      howling storm again resounded the powerful voice:
    

      “Whither did your doubts tend, you arrogant sage, who renounce
      humility, the most beautiful adornment of earthly virtues? You abandoned
      the friendly shelter of credulous simplicity to wander in the desert of
      doubt. You have seen this dead space from which the living gods have
      departed. Will you traverse it, you insignificant worm, who crawl in the
      dust of your pitiful profanation of the gods? Will you vivify the world?
      Will you conceive the unknown divinity to whom you do not dare to pray?
      You miserable digger of dung, soiled by the smut of ruined altars, are you
      perchance the architect who shall build the new temple? Upon what do you
      base your hopes, you who disavow the old gods and have no new gods to take
      their place? The eternal night of doubts unsolved, the dead desert,
      deprived of the living spirit—this is your world, you pitiful
      worm, who gnawed at the living belief which was a refuge for simple
      hearts, who converted the world into a dead chaos. Now, then, where are
      you, you insignificant, blasphemous sage?”
    

      Nothing was heard but the mighty storm roaring through the spaces. Then
      the thunder died away, the wind folded its pinions, and torrents of rain
      streamed through the darkness, like incessant floods of tears which
      threatened to devour the earth and drown it in a deluge of unquenchable
      grief.
    

      It seemed to Ctesippus that the master was overcome, and that the
      fearless, restless, questioning voice had been silenced forever. But a few
      moments later it issued again from the same spot.
    

      “Your words, son of Cronos, hit the mark better than your
      thunderbolts. The thoughts you have cast into my terrified soul have
      haunted me often, and it has sometimes seemed as if my heart would break
      under the burden of their unendurable anguish. Yes, I abandoned the
      friendly shelter of credulous simplicity. Yes, I have seen the spaces from
      which the living gods have departed enveloped in the night of eternal
      doubt. But I walked without fear, for my ‘Daemon’ lighted the
      way, the divine beginning of all life. Let us investigate the question.
      Are not offerings of incense burnt on your altars in the name of Him who
      gives life? You are stealing what belongs to another! Not you, but that
      other, is served by credulous simplicity. Yes, you are right, I am no
      architect. I am not the builder of a new temple. Not to me was it given to
      raise from the earth to the heavens the glorious structure of the coming
      faith. I am one who digs dung, soiled by the smut of destruction. But my
      conscience tells me, son of Cronos, that the work of one who digs dung is
      also necessary for the future temple. When the time comes for the proud
      and stately edifice to stand on the purified place, and for the living
      divinity of the new belief to erect his throne upon it, I, the modest
      digger of dung, will go to him and say: ‘Here am I who restlessly
      crawled in the dust of disavowal. When surrounded by fog and soot, I had
      no time to raise my eyes from the ground; my head had only a vague
      conception of the future building. Will you reject me, you just one, Just,
      and True, and Great?’”
    

      Silence and astonishment reigned in the spaces. Then Socrates raised his
      voice, and continued:
    

      “The sunbeam falls upon the filthy puddle, and light vapour, leaving
      heavy mud behind, rises to the sun, melts, and dissolves in the ether.
      With your sunbeam you touched my dust-laden soul and it aspired to you,
      Unknown One, whose name is mystery! I sought for you, because you are
      Truth; I strove to attain to you, because you are Justice; I loved you,
      because you are Love; I died for you, because you are the Source of Life.
      Will you reject me, O Unknown? My torturing doubts, my passionate search
      for truth, my difficult life, my voluntary death—accept them as a
      bloodless offering, as a prayer, as a sigh! Absorb them as the
      immeasurable ether absorbs the evaporating mists! Take them, you whose
      name I do not know, let not the ghosts of the night I have traversed bar
      the way to you, to eternal light! Give way, you shades who dim the light
      of the dawn! I tell you, gods of my people, you are unjust, and where
      there is no justice there can be no truth, but only phantoms, creations of
      a dream. To this conclusion have I come, I, Socrates, who sought to fathom
      all things. Rise, dead mists, I go my way to Him whom I have sought all my
      life long!”
    

      The thunder burst again—a short, abrupt peal, as if the egis had
      fallen from the weakened hand of the thunderer. Storm-voices trembled from
      the mountains, sounding dully in the gorges, and died away in the clefts.
      In their place resounded other, marvellous tones.
    

      When Ctesippus looked up in astonishment, a spectacle presented itself
      such as no mortal eyes had ever seen.
    

      The night vanished. The clouds lifted, and godly figures floated in the
      azure like golden ornaments on the hem of a festive robe. Heroic forms
      glimmered over the remote crags and ravines, and Elpidias, whose little
      figure was seen standing at the edge of a cleft in the rocks, stretched
      his hands toward them, as if beseeching the vanishing gods for a solution
      of his fate.
    

      A mountain-peak now stood out clearly above the mysterious mist, gleaming
      like a torch over dark blue valleys. The son of Cronos, the thunderer, was
      no longer enthroned upon it, and the other Olympians too were gone.
    

      Socrates stood alone in the light of the sun under the high heavens.
    

      Ctesippus was distinctly conscious of the pulse-beat of a mysterious life
      quivering throughout nature, stirring even the tiniest blade of grass.
    

      A breath seemed to be stirring the balmy air, a voice to be sounding in
      wonderful harmony, an invisible tread to be heard—the tread of the
      radiant Dawn!
    

      And on the illumined peak a man still stood, stretching out his arms in
      mute ecstasy, moved by a mighty impulse.
    

      A moment, and all disappeared, and the light of an ordinary day shone upon
      the awakened soul of Ctesippus. It was like dismal twilight after the
      revelation of nature that had blown upon him the breath of an unknown
      life.
    








      In deep silence the pupils of the philosopher listened to the marvellous
      recital of Ctesippus. Plato broke the silence.
    

      “Let us investigate the dream and its significance,” he said.
    

      “Let us investigate it,” responded the others.
