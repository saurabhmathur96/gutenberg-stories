THE DUEL

t was eight o’clock
      in the morning—the time when the officers, the local officials, and
      the visitors usually took their morning dip in the sea after the hot,
      stifling night, and then went into the pavilion to drink tea or coffee.
      Ivan Andreitch Laevsky, a thin, fair young man of twenty-eight, wearing
      the cap of a clerk in the Ministry of Finance and with slippers on his
      feet, coming down to bathe, found a number of acquaintances on the beach,
      and among them his friend Samoylenko, the army doctor.

 With his big cropped head, short neck, his red face, his big nose, his
      shaggy black eyebrows and grey whiskers, his stout puffy figure and his
      hoarse military bass, this Samoylenko made on every newcomer the
      unpleasant impression of a gruff bully; but two or three days after making
      his acquaintance, one began to think his face extraordinarily
      good-natured, kind, and even handsome. In spite of his clumsiness and
      rough manner, he was a peaceable man, of infinite kindliness and goodness
      of heart, always ready to be of use. He was on familiar terms with every
      one in the town, lent every one money, doctored every one, made matches,
      patched up quarrels, arranged picnics at which he cooked shashlik and an awfully good soup of grey mullets. He was always looking after
      other people’s affairs and trying to interest some one on their
      behalf, and was always delighted about something. The general opinion
      about him was that he was without faults of character. He had only two
      weaknesses: he was ashamed of his own good nature, and tried to disguise
      it by a surly expression and an assumed gruffness; and he liked his
      assistants and his soldiers to call him “Your Excellency,”
      although he was only a civil councillor.

 “Answer one question for me, Alexandr Daviditch,” Laevsky
      began, when both he and Samoylenko were in the water up to their
      shoulders. “Suppose you had loved a woman and had been living with
      her for two or three years, and then left off caring for her, as one does,
      and began to feel that you had nothing in common with her. How would you
      behave in that case?”

 “It’s very simple. ‘You go where you please, madam’—and
      that would be the end of it.”

 “It’s easy to say that! But if she has nowhere to go? A woman
      with no friends or relations, without a farthing, who can’t work . .
      .”

 “Well? Five hundred roubles down or an allowance of twenty-five
      roubles a month—and nothing more. It’s very simple.”

 “Even supposing you have five hundred roubles and can pay
      twenty-five roubles a month, the woman I am speaking of is an educated
      woman and proud. Could you really bring yourself to offer her money? And
      how would you do it?”

 Samoylenko was going to answer, but at that moment a big wave covered them
      both, then broke on the beach and rolled back noisily over the shingle.
      The friends got out and began dressing.

 “Of course, it is difficult to live with a woman if you don’t
      love her,” said Samoylenko, shaking the sand out of his boots.
      “But one must look at the thing humanely, Vanya. If it were my case,
      I should never show a sign that I did not love her, and I should go on
      living with her till I died.”

 He was at once ashamed of his own words; he pulled himself up and said:

 “But for aught I care, there might be no females at all. Let them
      all go to the devil!”

 The friends dressed and went into the pavilion. There Samoylenko was quite
      at home, and even had a special cup and saucer. Every morning they brought
      him on a tray a cup of coffee, a tall cut glass of iced water, and a tiny
      glass of brandy. He would first drink the brandy, then the hot coffee,
      then the iced water, and this must have been very nice, for after drinking
      it his eyes looked moist with pleasure, he would stroke his whiskers with
      both hands, and say, looking at the sea:

 “A wonderfully magnificent view!”

 After a long night spent in cheerless, unprofitable thoughts which
      prevented him from sleeping, and seemed to intensify the darkness and
      sultriness of the night, Laevsky felt listless and shattered. He felt no
      better for the bathe and the coffee.

 “Let us go on with our talk, Alexandr Daviditch,” he said.
      “I won’t make a secret of it; I’ll speak to you openly
      as to a friend. Things are in a bad way with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and me .
      . . a very bad way! Forgive me for forcing my private affairs upon you,
      but I must speak out.”

 Samoylenko, who had a misgiving of what he was going to speak about,
      dropped his eyes and drummed with his fingers on the table.

 “I’ve lived with her for two years and have ceased to love
      her,” Laevsky went on; “or, rather, I realised that I never
      had felt any love for her. . . . These two years have been a mistake.”

 It was Laevsky’s habit as he talked to gaze attentively at the pink
      palms of his hands, to bite his nails, or to pinch his cuffs. And he did
      so now.

 “I know very well you can’t help me,” he said. “But
      I tell you, because unsuccessful and superfluous people like me find their
      salvation in talking. I have to generalise about everything I do. I’m
      bound to look for an explanation and justification of my absurd existence
      in somebody else’s theories, in literary types—in the idea
      that we, upper-class Russians, are degenerating, for instance, and so on.
      Last night, for example, I comforted myself by thinking all the time:
      ‘Ah, how true Tolstoy is, how mercilessly true!’ And that did
      me good. Yes, really, brother, he is a great writer, say what you like!”

 Samoylenko, who had never read Tolstoy and was intending to do so every
      day of his life, was a little embarrassed, and said:

 “Yes, all other authors write from imagination, but he writes
      straight from nature.”

 “My God!” sighed Laevsky; “how distorted we all are by
      civilisation! I fell in love with a married woman and she with me. . . .
      To begin with, we had kisses, and calm evenings, and vows, and Spencer,
      and ideals, and interests in common. . . . What a deception! We really ran
      away from her husband, but we lied to ourselves and made out that we ran
      away from the emptiness of the life of the educated class. We pictured our
      future like this: to begin with, in the Caucasus, while we were getting to
      know the people and the place, I would put on the Government uniform and
      enter the service; then at our leisure we would pick out a plot of ground,
      would toil in the sweat of our brow, would have a vineyard and a field,
      and so on. If you were in my place, or that zoologist of yours, Von Koren,
      you might live with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna for thirty years, perhaps, and
      might leave your heirs a rich vineyard and three thousand acres of maize;
      but I felt like a bankrupt from the first day. In the town you have
      insufferable heat, boredom, and no society; if you go out into the
      country, you fancy poisonous spiders, scorpions, or snakes lurking under
      every stone and behind every bush, and beyond the fields—mountains
      and the desert. Alien people, an alien country, a wretched form of
      civilisation—all that is not so easy, brother, as walking on the
      Nevsky Prospect in one’s fur coat, arm-in-arm with Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna, dreaming of the sunny South. What is needed here is a life and
      death struggle, and I’m not a fighting man. A wretched neurasthenic,
      an idle gentleman . . . . From the first day I knew that my dreams of a
      life of labour and of a vineyard were worthless. As for love, I ought to
      tell you that living with a woman who has read Spencer and has followed
      you to the ends of the earth is no more interesting than living with any
      Anfissa or Akulina. There’s the same smell of ironing, of powder,
      and of medicines, the same curl-papers every morning, the same
      self-deception.”

 “You can’t get on in the house without an iron,” said
      Samoylenko, blushing at Laevsky’s speaking to him so openly of a
      lady he knew. “You are out of humour to-day, Vanya, I notice.
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna is a splendid woman, highly educated, and you are a
      man of the highest intellect. Of course, you are not married,”
      Samoylenko went on, glancing round at the adjacent tables, “but that’s
      not your fault; and besides . . . one ought to be above conventional
      prejudices and rise to the level of modern ideas. I believe in free love
      myself, yes. . . . But to my thinking, once you have settled together, you
      ought to go on living together all your life.”

 “Without love?”

 “I will tell you directly,” said Samoylenko. “Eight
      years ago there was an old fellow, an agent, here—a man of very
      great intelligence. Well, he used to say that the great thing in married
      life was patience. Do you hear, Vanya? Not love, but patience. Love cannot
      last long. You have lived two years in love, and now evidently your
      married life has reached the period when, in order to preserve
      equilibrium, so to speak, you ought to exercise all your patience. . . .”

 “You believe in your old agent; to me his words are meaningless.
      Your old man could be a hypocrite; he could exercise himself in the virtue
      of patience, and, as he did so, look upon a person he did not love as an
      object indispensable for his moral exercises; but I have not yet fallen so
      low. If I want to exercise myself in patience, I will buy dumb-bells or a
      frisky horse, but I’ll leave human beings alone.”

 Samoylenko asked for some white wine with ice. When they had drunk a glass
      each, Laevsky suddenly asked:

 “Tell me, please, what is the meaning of softening of the brain?”

 “How can I explain it to you? . . . It’s a disease in which
      the brain becomes softer . . . as it were, dissolves.”

 “Is it curable?”

 “Yes, if the disease is not neglected. Cold douches, blisters. . . .
      Something internal, too.”

 “Oh! . . . Well, you see my position; I can’t live with her:
      it is more than I can do. While I’m with you I can be philosophical
      about it and smile, but at home I lose heart completely; I am so utterly
      miserable, that if I were told, for instance, that I should have to live
      another month with her, I should blow out my brains. At the same time,
      parting with her is out of the question. She has no friends or relations;
      she cannot work, and neither she nor I have any money. . . . What could
      become of her? To whom could she go? There is nothing one can think of. .
      . . Come, tell me, what am I to do?”

 “H’m! . . .” growled Samoylenko, not knowing what to
      answer. “Does she love you?”

 “Yes, she loves me in so far as at her age and with her temperament
      she wants a man. It would be as difficult for her to do without me as to
      do without her powder or her curl-papers. I am for her an indispensable,
      integral part of her boudoir.”

 Samoylenko was embarrassed.

 “You are out of humour to-day, Vanya,” he said. “You
      must have had a bad night.”

 “Yes, I slept badly. . . . Altogether, I feel horribly out of sorts,
      brother. My head feels empty; there’s a sinking at my heart, a
      weakness. . . . I must run away.”

 “Run where?”

 “There, to the North. To the pines and the mushrooms, to people and
      ideas. . . . I’d give half my life to bathe now in some little
      stream in the province of Moscow or Tula; to feel chilly, you know, and
      then to stroll for three hours even with the feeblest student, and to talk
      and talk endlessly. . . . And the scent of the hay! Do you remember it?
      And in the evening, when one walks in the garden, sounds of the piano
      float from the house; one hears the train passing. . . .”

 Laevsky laughed with pleasure; tears came into his eyes, and to cover
      them, without getting up, he stretched across the next table for the
      matches.

 “I have not been in Russia for eighteen years,” said
      Samoylenko. “I’ve forgotten what it is like. To my mind, there
      is not a country more splendid than the Caucasus.”

 “Vereshtchagin has a picture in which some men condemned to death
      are languishing at the bottom of a very deep well. Your magnificent
      Caucasus strikes me as just like that well. If I were offered the choice
      of a chimney-sweep in Petersburg or a prince in the Caucasus, I should
      choose the job of chimney-sweep.”

 Laevsky grew pensive. Looking at his stooping figure, at his eyes fixed
      dreamily at one spot, at his pale, perspiring face and sunken temples, at
      his bitten nails, at the slipper which had dropped off his heel,
      displaying a badly darned sock, Samoylenko was moved to pity, and probably
      because Laevsky reminded him of a helpless child, he asked:

 “Is your mother living?”

 “Yes, but we are on bad terms. She could not forgive me for this
      affair.”

 Samoylenko was fond of his friend. He looked upon Laevsky as a
      good-natured fellow, a student, a man with no nonsense about him, with
      whom one could drink, and laugh, and talk without reserve. What he
      understood in him he disliked extremely. Laevsky drank a great deal and at
      unsuitable times; he played cards, despised his work, lived beyond his
      means, frequently made use of unseemly expressions in conversation, walked
      about the streets in his slippers, and quarrelled with Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna before other people—and Samoylenko did not like this. But
      the fact that Laevsky had once been a student in the Faculty of Arts,
      subscribed to two fat reviews, often talked so cleverly that only a few
      people understood him, was living with a well-educated woman—all
      this Samoylenko did not understand, and he liked this and respected
      Laevsky, thinking him superior to himself.

 “There is another point,” said Laevsky, shaking his head.
      “Only it is between ourselves. I’m concealing it from
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna for the time. . . . Don’t let it out before
      her. . . . I got a letter the day before yesterday, telling me that her
      husband has died from softening of the brain.”

 “The Kingdom of Heaven be his!” sighed Samoylenko. “Why
      are you concealing it from her?”

 “To show her that letter would be equivalent to ‘Come to
      church to be married.’ And we should first have to make our
      relations clear. When she understands that we can’t go on living
      together, I will show her the letter. Then there will be no danger in it.”

 “Do you know what, Vanya,” said Samoylenko, and a sad and
      imploring expression came into his face, as though he were going to ask
      him about something very touching and were afraid of being refused.
      “Marry her, my dear boy!”

 “Why?”

 “Do your duty to that splendid woman! Her husband is dead, and so
      Providence itself shows you what to do!”

 “But do understand, you queer fellow, that it is impossible. To
      marry without love is as base and unworthy of a man as to perform mass
      without believing in it.”

 “But it’s your duty to.”

 “Why is it my duty?” Laevsky asked irritably.

 “Because you took her away from her husband and made yourself
      responsible for her.”

 “But now I tell you in plain Russian, I don’t love her!”

 “Well, if you’ve no love, show her proper respect, consider
      her wishes. . . .”

 “‘Show her respect, consider her wishes,’” Laevsky
      mimicked him. “As though she were some Mother Superior! . . . You
      are a poor psychologist and physiologist if you think that living with a
      woman one can get off with nothing but respect and consideration. What a
      woman thinks most of is her bedroom.”

 “Vanya, Vanya!” said Samoylenko, overcome with confusion.

 “You are an elderly child, a theorist, while I am an old man in
      spite of my years, and practical, and we shall never understand one
      another. We had better drop this conversation. Mustapha!” Laevsky
      shouted to the waiter. “What’s our bill?”

 “No, no . . .” the doctor cried in dismay, clutching Laevsky’s
      arm. “It is for me to pay. I ordered it. Make it out to me,”
      he cried to Mustapha.

 The friends got up and walked in silence along the sea-front. When they
      reached the boulevard, they stopped and shook hands at parting.

 “You are awfully spoilt, my friend!” Samoylenko sighed.
      “Fate has sent you a young, beautiful, cultured woman, and you
      refuse the gift, while if God were to give me a crooked old woman, how
      pleased I should be if only she were kind and affectionate! I would live
      with her in my vineyard and . . .”

 Samoylenko caught himself up and said:

 “And she might get the samovar ready for me there, the old hag.”

 After parting with Laevsky he walked along the boulevard. When, bulky and
      majestic, with a stern expression on his face, he walked along the
      boulevard in his snow-white tunic and superbly polished boots, squaring
      his chest, decorated with the Vladimir cross on a ribbon, he was very much
      pleased with himself, and it seemed as though the whole world were looking
      at him with pleasure. Without turning his head, he looked to each side and
      thought that the boulevard was extremely well laid out; that the young
      cypress-trees, the eucalyptuses, and the ugly, anemic palm-trees were very
      handsome and would in time give abundant shade; that the Circassians were
      an honest and hospitable people.

 “It’s strange that Laevsky does not like the Caucasus,”
      he thought, “very strange.”

 Five soldiers, carrying rifles, met him and saluted him. On the right side
      of the boulevard the wife of a local official was walking along the
      pavement with her son, a schoolboy.

 “Good-morning, Marya Konstantinovna,” Samoylenko shouted to
      her with a pleasant smile. “Have you been to bathe? Ha, ha, ha! . .
      . My respects to Nikodim Alexandritch!”

 And he went on, still smiling pleasantly, but seeing an assistant of the
      military hospital coming towards him, he suddenly frowned, stopped him,
      and asked:

 “Is there any one in the hospital?”

 “No one, Your Excellency.”

 “Eh?”

 “No one, Your Excellency.”

 “Very well, run along. . . .”

 Swaying majestically, he made for the lemonade stall, where sat a
      full-bosomed old Jewess, who gave herself out to be a Georgian, and said
      to her as loudly as though he were giving the word of command to a
      regiment:

 “Be so good as to give me some soda-water!”

 II

 Laevsky’s not loving Nadyezhda Fyodorovna showed itself chiefly in
      the fact that everything she said or did seemed to him a lie, or
      equivalent to a lie, and everything he read against women and love seemed
      to him to apply perfectly to himself, to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and her
      husband. When he returned home, she was sitting at the window, dressed and
      with her hair done, and with a preoccupied face was drinking coffee and
      turning over the leaves of a fat magazine; and he thought the drinking of
      coffee was not such a remarkable event that she need put on a preoccupied
      expression over it, and that she had been wasting her time doing her hair
      in a fashionable style, as there was no one here to attract and no need to
      be attractive. And in the magazine he saw nothing but falsity. He thought
      she had dressed and done her hair so as to look handsomer, and was reading
      in order to seem clever.

 “Will it be all right for me to go to bathe to-day?” she said.

 “Why? There won’t be an earthquake whether you go or not, I
      suppose . . . .”

 “No, I only ask in case the doctor should be vexed.”

 “Well, ask the doctor, then; I’m not a doctor.”

 On this occasion what displeased Laevsky most in Nadyezhda Fyodorovna was
      her white open neck and the little curls at the back of her head. And he
      remembered that when Anna Karenin got tired of her husband, what she
      disliked most of all was his ears, and thought: “How true it is, how
      true!”

 Feeling weak and as though his head were perfectly empty, he went into his
      study, lay down on his sofa, and covered his face with a handkerchief that
      he might not be bothered by the flies. Despondent and oppressive thoughts
      always about the same thing trailed slowly across his brain like a long
      string of waggons on a gloomy autumn evening, and he sank into a state of
      drowsy oppression. It seemed to him that he had wronged Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna and her husband, and that it was through his fault that her
      husband had died. It seemed to him that he had sinned against his own
      life, which he had ruined, against the world of lofty ideas, of learning,
      and of work, and he conceived that wonderful world as real and possible,
      not on this sea-front with hungry Turks and lazy mountaineers sauntering
      upon it, but there in the North, where there were operas, theatres,
      newspapers, and all kinds of intellectual activity. One could only there—not
      here—be honest, intelligent, lofty, and pure. He accused himself of
      having no ideal, no guiding principle in life, though he had a dim
      understanding now what it meant. Two years before, when he fell in love
      with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, it seemed to him that he had only to go with
      her as his wife to the Caucasus, and he would be saved from vulgarity and
      emptiness; in the same way now, he was convinced that he had only to part
      from Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and to go to Petersburg, and he would get
      everything he wanted.

 “Run away,” he muttered to himself, sitting up and biting his
      nails. “Run away!”

 He pictured in his imagination how he would go aboard the steamer and then
      would have some lunch, would drink some cold beer, would talk on deck with
      ladies, then would get into the train at Sevastopol and set off. Hurrah
      for freedom! One station after another would flash by, the air would keep
      growing colder and keener, then the birches and the fir-trees, then Kursk,
      Moscow. . . . In the restaurants cabbage soup, mutton with kasha,
      sturgeon, beer, no more Asiaticism, but Russia, real Russia. The
      passengers in the train would talk about trade, new singers, the
      Franco-Russian entente ; on all sides there would be the feeling of
      keen, cultured, intellectual, eager life. . . . Hasten on, on! At last
      Nevsky Prospect, and Great Morskaya Street, and then Kovensky Place, where
      he used to live at one time when he was a student, the dear grey sky, the
      drizzling rain, the drenched cabmen. . . .

 “Ivan Andreitch!” some one called from the next room. “Are
      you at home?”

 “I’m here,” Laevsky responded. “What do you want?”

 “Papers.”

 Laevsky got up languidly, feeling giddy, walked into the other room,
      yawning and shuffling with his slippers. There, at the open window that
      looked into the street, stood one of his young fellow-clerks, laying out
      some government documents on the window-sill.

 “One minute, my dear fellow,” Laevsky said softly, and he went
      to look for the ink; returning to the window, he signed the papers without
      looking at them, and said: “It’s hot!”

 “Yes. Are you coming to-day?”

 “I don’t think so. . . . I’m not quite well. Tell
      Sheshkovsky that I will come and see him after dinner.”

 The clerk went away. Laevsky lay down on his sofa again and began
      thinking:

 “And so I must weigh all the circumstances and reflect on them.
      Before I go away from here I ought to pay up my debts. I owe about two
      thousand roubles. I have no money. . . . Of course, that’s not
      important; I shall pay part now, somehow, and I shall send the rest,
      later, from Petersburg. The chief point is Nadyezhda Fyodorovna. . . .
      First of all we must define our relations. . . . Yes.”

 A little later he was considering whether it would not be better to go to
      Samoylenko for advice.

 “I might go,” he thought, “but what use would there be
      in it? I shall only say something inappropriate about boudoirs, about
      women, about what is honest or dishonest. What’s the use of talking
      about what is honest or dishonest, if I must make haste to save my life,
      if I am suffocating in this cursed slavery and am killing myself? . . .
      One must realise at last that to go on leading the life I do is something
      so base and so cruel that everything else seems petty and trivial beside
      it. To run away,” he muttered, sitting down, “to run away.”

 The deserted seashore, the insatiable heat, and the monotony of the smoky
      lilac mountains, ever the same and silent, everlastingly solitary,
      overwhelmed him with depression, and, as it were, made him drowsy and
      sapped his energy. He was perhaps very clever, talented, remarkably
      honest; perhaps if the sea and the mountains had not closed him in on all
      sides, he might have become an excellent Zemstvo leader, a statesman, an
      orator, a political writer, a saint. Who knows? If so, was it not stupid
      to argue whether it were honest or dishonest when a gifted and useful man—an
      artist or musician, for instance—to escape from prison, breaks a
      wall and deceives his jailers? Anything is honest when a man is in such a
      position.

 At two o’clock Laevsky and Nadyezhda Fyodorovna sat down to dinner.
      When the cook gave them rice and tomato soup, Laevsky said:

 “The same thing every day. Why not have cabbage soup?”

 “There are no cabbages.”

 “It’s strange. Samoylenko has cabbage soup and Marya
      Konstantinovna has cabbage soup, and only I am obliged to eat this mawkish
      mess. We can’t go on like this, darling.”

 As is common with the vast majority of husbands and wives, not a single
      dinner had in earlier days passed without scenes and fault-finding between
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and Laevsky; but ever since Laevsky had made up his
      mind that he did not love her, he had tried to give way to Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna in everything, spoke to her gently and politely, smiled, and
      called her “darling.”

 “This soup tastes like liquorice,” he said, smiling; he made
      an effort to control himself and seem amiable, but could not refrain from
      saying: “Nobody looks after the housekeeping. . . . If you are too
      ill or busy with reading, let me look after the cooking.”

 In earlier days she would have said to him, “Do by all means,”
      or, “I see you want to turn me into a cook”; but now she only
      looked at him timidly and flushed crimson.

 “Well, how do you feel to-day?” he asked kindly.

 “I am all right to-day. There is nothing but a little weakness.”

 “You must take care of yourself, darling. I am awfully anxious about
      you.”

 Nadyezhda Fyodorovna was ill in some way. Samoylenko said she had
      intermittent fever, and gave her quinine; the other doctor, Ustimovitch, a
      tall, lean, unsociable man, who used to sit at home in the daytime, and in
      the evenings walk slowly up and down on the sea-front coughing, with his
      hands folded behind him and a cane stretched along his back, was of
      opinion that she had a female complaint, and prescribed warm compresses.
      In old days, when Laevsky loved her, Nadyezhda Fyodorovna’s illness
      had excited his pity and terror; now he saw falsity even in her illness.
      Her yellow, sleepy face, her lustreless eyes, her apathetic expression,
      and the yawning that always followed her attacks of fever, and the fact
      that during them she lay under a shawl and looked more like a boy than a
      woman, and that it was close and stuffy in her room—all this, in his
      opinion, destroyed the illusion and was an argument against love and
      marriage.

 The next dish given him was spinach with hard-boiled eggs, while Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna, as an invalid, had jelly and milk. When with a preoccupied
      face she touched the jelly with a spoon and then began languidly eating
      it, sipping milk, and he heard her swallowing, he was possessed by such an
      overwhelming aversion that it made his head tingle. He recognised that
      such a feeling would be an insult even to a dog, but he was angry, not
      with himself but with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, for arousing such a feeling,
      and he understood why lovers sometimes murder their mistresses. He would
      not murder her, of course, but if he had been on a jury now, he would have
      acquitted the murderer.

 “Merci, darling,” he said after dinner, and kissed Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna on the forehead.

 Going back into his study, he spent five minutes in walking to and fro,
      looking at his boots; then he sat down on his sofa and muttered:

 “Run away, run away! We must define the position and run away!”

 He lay down on the sofa and recalled again that Nadyezhda Fyodorovna’s
      husband had died, perhaps, by his fault.

 “To blame a man for loving a woman, or ceasing to love a woman, is
      stupid,” he persuaded himself, lying down and raising his legs in
      order to put on his high boots. “Love and hatred are not under our
      control. As for her husband, maybe I was in an indirect way one of the
      causes of his death; but again, is it my fault that I fell in love with
      his wife and she with me?”

 Then he got up, and finding his cap, set off to the lodgings of his
      colleague, Sheshkovsky, where the Government clerks met every day to play vint and drink beer.

 “My indecision reminds me of Hamlet,” thought Laevsky on the
      way. “How truly Shakespeare describes it! Ah, how truly!”

 III

 For the sake of sociability and from sympathy for the hard plight of
      newcomers without families, who, as there was not an hotel in the town,
      had nowhere to dine, Dr. Samoylenko kept a sort of table d’hôte. At
      this time there were only two men who habitually dined with him: a young
      zoologist called Von Koren, who had come for the summer to the Black Sea
      to study the embryology of the medusa, and a deacon called Pobyedov, who
      had only just left the seminary and been sent to the town to take the duty
      of the old deacon who had gone away for a cure. Each of them paid twelve
      roubles a month for their dinner and supper, and Samoylenko made them
      promise to turn up at two o’clock punctually.

 Von Koren was usually the first to appear. He sat down in the drawing-room
      in silence, and taking an album from the table, began attentively
      scrutinising the faded photographs of unknown men in full trousers and
      top-hats, and ladies in crinolines and caps. Samoylenko only remembered a
      few of them by name, and of those whom he had forgotten he said with a
      sigh: “A very fine fellow, remarkably intelligent!” When he
      had finished with the album, Von Koren took a pistol from the whatnot, and
      screwing up his left eye, took deliberate aim at the portrait of Prince
      Vorontsov, or stood still at the looking-glass and gazed a long time at
      his swarthy face, his big forehead, and his black hair, which curled like
      a negro’s, and his shirt of dull-coloured cotton with big flowers on
      it like a Persian rug, and the broad leather belt he wore instead of a
      waistcoat. The contemplation of his own image seemed to afford him almost
      more satisfaction than looking at photographs or playing with the pistols.
      He was very well satisfied with his face, and his becomingly clipped
      beard, and the broad shoulders, which were unmistakable evidence of his
      excellent health and physical strength. He was satisfied, too, with his
      stylish get-up, from the cravat, which matched the colour of his shirt,
      down to his brown boots.

 While he was looking at the album and standing before the glass, at that
      moment, in the kitchen and in the passage near, Samoylenko, without his
      coat and waistcoat, with his neck bare, excited and bathed in
      perspiration, was bustling about the tables, mixing the salad, or making
      some sauce, or preparing meat, cucumbers, and onion for the cold soup,
      while he glared fiercely at the orderly who was helping him, and
      brandished first a knife and then a spoon at him.

 “Give me the vinegar!” he said. “That’s not the
      vinegar—it’s the salad oil!” he shouted, stamping.
      “Where are you off to, you brute?”

 “To get the butter, Your Excellency,” answered the flustered
      orderly in a cracked voice.

 “Make haste; it’s in the cupboard! And tell Daria to put some
      fennel in the jar with the cucumbers! Fennel! Cover the cream up, gaping
      laggard, or the flies will get into it!”

 And the whole house seemed resounding with his shouts. When it was ten or
      fifteen minutes to two the deacon would come in; he was a lanky young man
      of twenty-two, with long hair, with no beard and a hardly perceptible
      moustache. Going into the drawing-room, he crossed himself before the
      ikon, smiled, and held out his hand to Von Koren.

 “Good-morning,” the zoologist said coldly. “Where have
      you been?”

 “I’ve been catching sea-gudgeon in the harbour.”

 “Oh, of course. . . . Evidently, deacon, you will never be busy with
      work.”

 “Why not? Work is not like a bear; it doesn’t run off into the
      woods,” said the deacon, smiling and thrusting his hands into the
      very deep pockets of his white cassock.

 “There’s no one to whip you!” sighed the zoologist.

 Another fifteen or twenty minutes passed and they were not called to
      dinner, and they could still hear the orderly running into the kitchen and
      back again, noisily treading with his boots, and Samoylenko shouting:

 “Put it on the table! Where are your wits? Wash it first.”

 The famished deacon and Von Koren began tapping on the floor with their
      heels, expressing in this way their impatience like the audience at a
      theatre. At last the door opened and the harassed orderly announced that
      dinner was ready! In the dining-room they were met by Samoylenko, crimson
      in the face, wrathful, perspiring from the heat of the kitchen; he looked
      at them furiously, and with an expression of horror, took the lid off the
      soup tureen and helped each of them to a plateful; and only when he was
      convinced that they were eating it with relish and liked it, he gave a
      sigh of relief and settled himself in his deep arm-chair. His face looked
      blissful and his eyes grew moist. . . . He deliberately poured himself out
      a glass of vodka and said:

 “To the health of the younger generation.”

 After his conversation with Laevsky, from early morning till dinner
      Samoylenko had been conscious of a load at his heart, although he was in
      the best of humours; he felt sorry for Laevsky and wanted to help him.
      After drinking a glass of vodka before the soup, he heaved a sigh and
      said:

 “I saw Vanya Laevsky to-day. He is having a hard time of it, poor
      fellow! The material side of life is not encouraging for him, and the
      worst of it is all this psychology is too much for him. I’m sorry
      for the lad.”

 “Well, that is a person I am not sorry for,” said Von Koren.
      “If that charming individual were drowning, I would push him under
      with a stick and say, ‘Drown, brother, drown away.’ . . .”

 “That’s untrue. You wouldn’t do it.”

 “Why do you think that?” The zoologist shrugged his shoulders.
      “I’m just as capable of a good action as you are.”

 “Is drowning a man a good action?” asked the deacon, and he
      laughed.

 “Laevsky? Yes.”

 “I think there is something amiss with the soup . . .” said
      Samoylenko, anxious to change the conversation.

 “Laevsky is absolutely pernicious and is as dangerous to society as
      the cholera microbe,” Von Koren went on. “To drown him would
      be a service.”

 “It does not do you credit to talk like that about your neighbour.
      Tell us: what do you hate him for?”

 “Don’t talk nonsense, doctor. To hate and despise a microbe is
      stupid, but to look upon everybody one meets without distinction as one’s
      neighbour, whatever happens—thanks very much, that is equivalent to
      giving up criticism, renouncing a straightforward attitude to people,
      washing one’s hands of responsibility, in fact! I consider your
      Laevsky a blackguard; I do not conceal it, and I am perfectly
      conscientious in treating him as such. Well, you look upon him as your
      neighbour—and you may kiss him if you like: you look upon him as
      your neighbour, and that means that your attitude to him is the same as to
      me and to the deacon; that is no attitude at all. You are equally
      indifferent to all.”

 “To call a man a blackguard!” muttered Samoylenko, frowning
      with distaste—“that is so wrong that I can’t find words
      for it!”

 “People are judged by their actions,” Von Koren continued.
      “Now you decide, deacon. . . . I am going to talk to you, deacon.
      Mr. Laevsky’s career lies open before you, like a long Chinese
      puzzle, and you can read it from beginning to end. What has he been doing
      these two years that he has been living here? We will reckon his doings on
      our fingers. First, he has taught the inhabitants of the town to play vint :
      two years ago that game was unknown here; now they all play it from
      morning till late at night, even the women and the boys. Secondly, he has
      taught the residents to drink beer, which was not known here either; the
      inhabitants are indebted to him for the knowledge of various sorts of
      spirits, so that now they can distinguish Kospelov’s vodka from
      Smirnov’s No. 21, blindfold. Thirdly, in former days, people here
      made love to other men’s wives in secret, from the same motives as
      thieves steal in secret and not openly; adultery was considered something
      they were ashamed to make a public display of. Laevsky has come as a
      pioneer in that line; he lives with another man’s wife openly. . . .
      Fourthly . . .”

 Von Koren hurriedly ate up his soup and gave his plate to the orderly.

 “I understood Laevsky from the first month of our acquaintance,”
      he went on, addressing the deacon. “We arrived here at the same
      time. Men like him are very fond of friendship, intimacy, solidarity, and
      all the rest of it, because they always want company for vint ,
      drinking, and eating; besides, they are talkative and must have listeners.
      We made friends—that is, he turned up every day, hindered me
      working, and indulged in confidences in regard to his mistress. From the
      first he struck me by his exceptional falsity, which simply made me sick.
      As a friend I pitched into him, asking him why he drank too much, why he
      lived beyond his means and got into debt, why he did nothing and read
      nothing, why he had so little culture and so little knowledge; and in
      answer to all my questions he used to smile bitterly, sigh, and say:
      ‘I am a failure, a superfluous man’; or: ‘What do you
      expect, my dear fellow, from us, the debris of the serf-owning class?’
      or: ‘We are degenerate. . . .’ Or he would begin a long
      rigmarole about Onyegin, Petchorin, Byron’s Cain, and Bazarov, of
      whom he would say: ‘They are our fathers in flesh and in spirit.’
      So we are to understand that it was not his fault that Government
      envelopes lay unopened in his office for weeks together, and that he drank
      and taught others to drink, but Onyegin, Petchorin, and Turgenev, who had
      invented the failure and the superfluous man, were responsible for it. The
      cause of his extreme dissoluteness and unseemliness lies, do you see, not
      in himself, but somewhere outside in space. And so—an ingenious
      idea!—it is not only he who is dissolute, false, and disgusting, but
      we . . . ‘we men of the eighties,’ ‘we the spiritless,
      nervous offspring of the serf-owning class’; ‘civilisation has
      crippled us’ . . . in fact, we are to understand that such a great
      man as Laevsky is great even in his fall: that his dissoluteness, his lack
      of culture and of moral purity, is a phenomenon of natural history,
      sanctified by inevitability; that the causes of it are world-wide,
      elemental; and that we ought to hang up a lamp before Laevsky, since he is
      the fated victim of the age, of influences, of heredity, and so on. All
      the officials and their ladies were in ecstasies when they listened to
      him, and I could not make out for a long time what sort of man I had to
      deal with, a cynic or a clever rogue. Such types as he, on the surface
      intellectual with a smattering of education and a great deal of talk about
      their own nobility, are very clever in posing as exceptionally complex
      natures.”

 “Hold your tongue!” Samoylenko flared up. “I will not
      allow a splendid fellow to be spoken ill of in my presence!”

 “Don’t interrupt, Alexandr Daviditch,” said Von Koren
      coldly; “I am just finishing. Laevsky is by no means a complex
      organism. Here is his moral skeleton: in the morning, slippers, a bathe,
      and coffee; then till dinner-time, slippers, a constitutional, and
      conversation; at two o’clock slippers, dinner, and wine; at five o’clock
      a bathe, tea and wine, then vint and lying; at ten o’clock
      supper and wine; and after midnight sleep and la femme . His
      existence is confined within this narrow programme like an egg within its
      shell. Whether he walks or sits, is angry, writes, rejoices, it may all be
      reduced to wine, cards, slippers, and women. Woman plays a fatal,
      overwhelming part in his life. He tells us himself that at thirteen he was
      in love; that when he was a student in his first year he was living with a
      lady who had a good influence over him, and to whom he was indebted for
      his musical education. In his second year he bought a prostitute from a
      brothel and raised her to his level—that is, took her as his kept
      mistress, and she lived with him for six months and then ran away back to
      the brothel-keeper, and her flight caused him much spiritual suffering.
      Alas! his sufferings were so great that he had to leave the university and
      spend two years at home doing nothing. But this was all for the best. At
      home he made friends with a widow who advised him to leave the Faculty of
      Jurisprudence and go into the Faculty of Arts. And so he did. When he had
      taken his degree, he fell passionately in love with his present . . . what’s
      her name? . . . married lady, and was obliged to flee with her here to the
      Caucasus for the sake of his ideals, he would have us believe, seeing that
      . . . to-morrow, if not to-day, he will be tired of her and flee back
      again to Petersburg, and that, too, will be for the sake of his ideals.”

 “How do you know?” growled Samoylenko, looking angrily at the
      zoologist. “You had better eat your dinner.”

 The next course consisted of boiled mullet with Polish sauce. Samoylenko
      helped each of his companions to a whole mullet and poured out the sauce
      with his own hand. Two minutes passed in silence.

 “Woman plays an essential part in the life of every man,” said
      the deacon. “You can’t help that.”

 “Yes, but to what degree? For each of us woman means mother, sister,
      wife, friend. To Laevsky she is everything, and at the same time nothing
      but a mistress. She—that is, cohabitation with her— is the
      happiness and object of his life; he is gay, sad, bored, disenchanted—on
      account of woman; his life grows disagreeable —woman is to blame;
      the dawn of a new life begins to glow, ideals turn up—and again look
      for the woman. . . . He only derives enjoyment from books and pictures in
      which there is woman. Our age is, to his thinking, poor and inferior to
      the forties and the sixties only because we do not know how to abandon
      ourselves obviously to the passion and ecstasy of love. These voluptuaries
      must have in their brains a special growth of the nature of sarcoma, which
      stifles the brain and directs their whole psychology. Watch Laevsky when
      he is sitting anywhere in company. You notice: when one raises any general
      question in his presence, for instance, about the cell or instinct, he
      sits apart, and neither speaks nor listens; he looks languid and
      disillusioned; nothing has any interest for him, everything is vulgar and
      trivial. But as soon as you speak of male and female—for instance,
      of the fact that the female spider, after fertilisation, devours the male—his
      eyes glow with curiosity, his face brightens, and the man revives, in
      fact. All his thoughts, however noble, lofty, or neutral they may be, they
      all have one point of resemblance. You walk along the street with him and
      meet a donkey, for instance. . . . ‘Tell me, please,’ he asks,
      ‘what would happen if you mated a donkey with a camel?’ And
      his dreams! Has he told you of his dreams? It is magnificent! First, he
      dreams that he is married to the moon, then that he is summoned before the
      police and ordered to live with a guitar . . .”

 The deacon burst into resounding laughter; Samoylenko frowned and wrinkled
      up his face angrily so as not to laugh, but could not restrain himself,
      and laughed.

 “And it’s all nonsense!” he said, wiping his tears.
      “Yes, by Jove, it’s nonsense!”

 IV

 The deacon was very easily amused, and laughed at every trifle till he got
      a stitch in his side, till he was helpless. It seemed as though he only
      liked to be in people’s company because there was a ridiculous side
      to them, and because they might be given ridiculous nicknames. He had
      nicknamed Samoylenko “the tarantula,” his orderly “the
      drake,” and was in ecstasies when on one occasion Von Koren spoke of
      Laevsky and Nadyezhda Fyodorovna as “Japanese monkeys.” He
      watched people’s faces greedily, listened without bGlinking, and it
      could be seen that his eyes filled with laughter and his face was tense
      with expectation of the moment when he could let himself go and burst into
      laughter.

 “He is a corrupt and depraved type,” the zoologist continued,
      while the deacon kept his eyes riveted on his face, expecting he would say
      something funny. “It is not often one can meet with such a
      nonentity. In body he is inert, feeble, prematurely old, while in
      intellect he differs in no respect from a fat shopkeeper’s wife who
      does nothing but eat, drink, and sleep on a feather-bed, and who keeps her
      coachman as a lover.”

 The deacon began guffawing again.

 “Don’t laugh, deacon,” said Von Koren. “It grows
      stupid, at last. I should not have paid attention to his insignificance,”
      he went on, after waiting till the deacon had left off laughing; “I
      should have passed him by if he were not so noxious and dangerous. His
      noxiousness lies first of all in the fact that he has great success with
      women, and so threatens to leave descendants—that is, to present the
      world with a dozen Laevskys as feeble and as depraved as himself.
      Secondly, he is in the highest degree contaminating. I have spoken to you
      already of vint and beer. In another year or two he will dominate
      the whole Caucasian coast. You know how the mass, especially its middle
      stratum, believe in intellectuality, in a university education, in
      gentlemanly manners, and in literary language. Whatever filthy thing he
      did, they would all believe that it was as it should be, since he is an
      intellectual man, of liberal ideas and university education. What is more,
      he is a failure, a superfluous man, a neurasthenic, a victim of the age,
      and that means he can do anything. He is a charming fellow, a regular good
      sort, he is so genuinely indulgent to human weaknesses; he is compliant,
      accommodating, easy and not proud; one can drink with him and gossip and
      talk evil of people. . . . The masses, always inclined to anthropomorphism
      in religion and morals, like best of all the little gods who have the same
      weaknesses as themselves. Only think what a wide field he has for
      contamination! Besides, he is not a bad actor and is a clever hypocrite,
      and knows very well how to twist things round. Only take his little shifts
      and dodges, his attitude to civilisation, for instance. He has scarcely
      sniffed at civilisation, yet: ‘Ah, how we have been crippled by
      civilisation! Ah, how I envy those savages, those children of nature, who
      know nothing of civilisation!’ We are to understand, you see, that
      at one time, in ancient days, he has been devoted to civilisation with his
      whole soul, has served it, has sounded it to its depths, but it has
      exhausted him, disillusioned him, deceived him; he is a Faust, do you see?—a
      second Tolstoy. . . . As for Schopenhauer and Spencer, he treats them like
      small boys and slaps them on the shoulder in a fatherly way: ‘Well,
      what do you say, old Spencer?’ He has not read Spencer, of course,
      but how charming he is when with light, careless irony he says of his lady
      friend: ‘She has read Spencer!’ And they all listen to him,
      and no one cares to understand that this charlatan has not the right to
      kiss the sole of Spencer’s foot, let alone speaking about him in
      that tone! Sapping the foundations of civilisation, of authority, of other
      people’s altars, spattering them with filth, winking jocosely at
      them only to justify and conceal one’s own rottenness and moral
      poverty is only possible for a very vain, base, and nasty creature.”

 “I don’t know what it is you expect of him, Kolya,” said
      Samoylenko, looking at the zoologist, not with anger now, but with a
      guilty air. “He is a man the same as every one else. Of course, he
      has his weaknesses, but he is abreast of modern ideas, is in the service,
      is of use to his country. Ten years ago there was an old fellow serving as
      agent here, a man of the greatest intelligence . . . and he used to say .
      . .”

 “Nonsense, nonsense!” the zoologist interrupted. “You
      say he is in the service; but how does he serve? Do you mean to tell me
      that things have been done better because he is here, and the officials
      are more punctual, honest, and civil? On the contrary, he has only
      sanctioned their slackness by his prestige as an intellectual university
      man. He is only punctual on the 20th of the month, when he gets his
      salary; on the other days he lounges about at home in slippers and tries
      to look as if he were doing the Government a great service by living in
      the Caucasus. No, Alexandr Daviditch, don’t stick up for him. You
      are insincere from beginning to end. If you really loved him and
      considered him your neighbour, you would above all not be indifferent to
      his weaknesses, you would not be indulgent to them, but for his own sake
      would try to make him innocuous.”

 “That is?”

 “Innocuous. Since he is incorrigible, he can only be made innocuous
      in one way. . . .” Von Koren passed his finger round his throat.
      “Or he might be drowned . . .”, he added. “In the
      interests of humanity and in their own interests, such people ought to be
      destroyed. They certainly ought.”

 “What are you saying?” muttered Samoylenko, getting up and
      looking with amazement at the zoologist’s calm, cold face. “Deacon,
      what is he saying? Why—are you in your senses?”

 “I don’t insist on the death penalty,” said Von Koren.
      “If it is proved that it is pernicious, devise something else. If we
      can’t destroy Laevsky, why then, isolate him, make him harmless,
      send him to hard labour.”

 “What are you saying!” said Samoylenko in horror. “With
      pepper, with pepper,” he cried in a voice of despair, seeing that
      the deacon was eating stuffed aubergines without pepper. “You with
      your great intellect, what are you saying! Send our friend, a proud
      intellectual man, to penal servitude!”

 “Well, if he is proud and tries to resist, put him in fetters!”

 Samoylenko could not utter a word, and only twiddled his fingers; the
      deacon looked at his flabbergasted and really absurd face, and laughed.

 “Let us leave off talking of that,” said the zoologist.
      “Only remember one thing, Alexandr Daviditch: primitive man was
      preserved from such as Laevsky by the struggle for existence and by
      natural selection; now our civilisation has considerably weakened the
      struggle and the selection, and we ought to look after the destruction of
      the rotten and worthless for ourselves; otherwise, when the Laevskys
      multiply, civilisation will perish and mankind will degenerate utterly. It
      will be our fault.”

 “If it depends on drowning and hanging,” said Samoylenko,
      “damnation take your civilisation, damnation take your humanity!
      Damnation take it! I tell you what: you are a very learned and intelligent
      man and the pride of your country, but the Germans have ruined you. Yes,
      the Germans! The Germans!”

 Since Samoylenko had left Dorpat, where he had studied medicine, he had
      rarely seen a German and had not read a single German book, but, in his
      opinion, every harmful idea in politics or science was due to the Germans.
      Where he had got this notion he could not have said himself, but he held
      it firmly.

 “Yes, the Germans!” he repeated once more. “Come and
      have some tea.”

 All three stood up, and putting on their hats, went out into the little
      garden, and sat there under the shade of the light green maples, the
      pear-trees, and a chestnut-tree. The zoologist and the deacon sat on a
      bench by the table, while Samoylenko sank into a deep wicker chair with a
      sloping back. The orderly handed them tea, jam, and a bottle of syrup.

 It was very hot, thirty degrees Réaumur in the shade. The sultry air was
      stagnant and motionless, and a long spider-web, stretching from the
      chestnut-tree to the ground, hung limply and did not stir.

 The deacon took up the guitar, which was constantly lying on the ground
      near the table, tuned it, and began singing softly in a thin voice:

 “‘Gathered round the tavern were the seminary lads,’”

 but instantly subsided, overcome by the heat, mopped his brow and glanced
      upwards at the blazing blue sky. Samoylenko grew drowsy; the sultry heat,
      the stillness and the delicious after-dinner languor, which quickly
      pervaded all his limbs, made him feel heavy and sleepy; his arms dropped
      at his sides, his eyes grew small, his head sank on his breast. He looked
      with almost tearful tenderness at Von Koren and the deacon, and muttered:

 “The younger generation. . . A scientific star and a luminary of the
      Church. . . . I shouldn’t wonder if the long-skirted alleluia will
      be shooting up into a bishop; I dare say I may come to kissing his hand. .
      . . Well . . . please God. . . .”

 Soon a snore was heard. Von Koren and the deacon finished their tea and
      went out into the street.

 “Are you going to the harbour again to catch sea-gudgeon?”
      asked the zoologist.

 “No, it’s too hot.”

 “Come and see me. You can pack up a parcel and copy something for
      me. By the way, we must have a talk about what you are to do. You must
      work, deacon. You can’t go on like this.”

 “Your words are just and logical,” said the deacon. “But
      my laziness finds an excuse in the circumstances of my present life. You
      know yourself that an uncertain position has a great tendency to make
      people apathetic. God only knows whether I have been sent here for a time
      or permanently. I am living here in uncertainty, while my wife is
      vegetating at her father’s and is missing me. And I must confess my
      brain is melting with the heat.”

 “That’s all nonsense,” said the zoologist. “You
      can get used to the heat, and you can get used to being without the
      deaconess. You mustn’t be slack; you must pull yourself together.”

 V

 Nadyezhda Fyodorovna went to bathe in the morning, and her cook, Olga,
      followed her with a jug, a copper basin, towels, and a sponge. In the bay
      stood two unknown steamers with dirty white funnels, obviously foreign
      cargo vessels. Some men dressed in white and wearing white shoes were
      walking along the harbour, shouting loudly in French, and were answered
      from the steamers. The bells were ringing briskly in the little church of
      the town.

 “To-day is Sunday!” Nadyezhda Fyodorovna remembered with
      pleasure.

 She felt perfectly well, and was in a gay holiday humour. In a new
      loose-fitting dress of coarse thick tussore silk, and a big wide-brimmed
      straw hat which was bent down over her ears, so that her face looked out
      as though from a basket, she fancied she looked very charming. She thought
      that in the whole town there was only one young, pretty, intellectual
      woman, and that was herself, and that she was the only one who knew how to
      dress herself cheaply, elegantly, and with taste. That dress, for example,
      cost only twenty-two roubles, and yet how charming it was! In the whole
      town she was the only one who could be attractive, while there were
      numbers of men, so they must all, whether they would or not, be envious of
      Laevsky.

 She was glad that of late Laevsky had been cold to her, reserved and
      polite, and at times even harsh and rude; in the past she had met all his
      outbursts, all his contemptuous, cold or strange incomprehensible glances,
      with tears, reproaches, and threats to leave him or to starve herself to
      death; now she only blushed, looked guiltily at him, and was glad he was
      not affectionate to her. If he had abused her, threatened her, it would
      have been better and pleasanter, since she felt hopelessly guilty towards
      him. She felt she was to blame, in the first place, for not sympathising
      with the dreams of a life of hard work, for the sake of which he had given
      up Petersburg and had come here to the Caucasus, and she was convinced
      that he had been angry with her of late for precisely that. When she was
      travelling to the Caucasus, it seemed that she would find here on the
      first day a cosy nook by the sea, a snug little garden with shade, with
      birds, with little brooks, where she could grow flowers and vegetables,
      rear ducks and hens, entertain her neighbours, doctor poor peasants and
      distribute little books amongst them. It had turned out that the Caucasus
      was nothing but bare mountains, forests, and huge valleys, where it took a
      long time and a great deal of effort to find anything and settle down;
      that there were no neighbours of any sort; that it was very hot and one
      might be robbed. Laevsky had been in no hurry to obtain a piece of land;
      she was glad of it, and they seemed to be in a tacit compact never to
      allude to a life of hard work. He was silent about it, she thought,
      because he was angry with her for being silent about it.

 In the second place, she had without his knowledge during those two years
      bought various trifles to the value of three hundred roubles at Atchmianov’s
      shop. She had bought the things by degrees, at one time materials, at
      another time silk or a parasol, and the debt had grown imperceptibly.

 “I will tell him about it to-day . . .”, she used to decide,
      but at once reflected that in Laevsky’s present mood it would hardly
      be convenient to talk to him of debts.

 Thirdly, she had on two occasions in Laevsky’s absence received a
      visit from Kirilin, the police captain: once in the morning when Laevsky
      had gone to bathe, and another time at midnight when he was playing cards.
      Remembering this, Nadyezhda Fyodorovna flushed crimson, and looked round
      at the cook as though she might overhear her thoughts. The long,
      insufferably hot, wearisome days, beautiful languorous evenings and
      stifling nights, and the whole manner of living, when from morning to
      night one is at a loss to fill up the useless hours, and the persistent
      thought that she was the prettiest young woman in the town, and that her
      youth was passing and being wasted, and Laevsky himself, though honest and
      idealistic, always the same, always lounging about in his slippers, biting
      his nails, and wearying her with his caprices, led by degrees to her
      becoming possessed by desire, and as though she were mad, she thought of
      nothing else day and night. Breathing, looking, walking, she felt nothing
      but desire. The sound of the sea told her she must love; the darkness of
      evening—the same; the mountains—the same. . . . And when
      Kirilin began paying her attentions, she had neither the power nor the
      wish to resist, and surrendered to him. . . .

 Now the foreign steamers and the men in white reminded her for some reason
      of a huge hall; together with the shouts of French she heard the strains
      of a waltz, and her bosom heaved with unaccountable delight. She longed to
      dance and talk French.

 She reflected joyfully that there was nothing terrible about her
      infidelity. Her soul had no part in her infidelity; she still loved
      Laevsky, and that was proved by the fact that she was jealous of him, was
      sorry for him, and missed him when he was away. Kirilin had turned out to
      be very mediocre, rather coarse though handsome; everything was broken off
      with him already and there would never be anything more. What had happened
      was over; it had nothing to do with any one, and if Laevsky found it out
      he would not believe in it.

 There was only one bathing-house for ladies on the sea-front; men bathed
      under the open sky. Going into the bathing-house, Nadyezhda Fyodorovna
      found there an elderly lady, Marya Konstantinovna Bityugov, and her
      daughter Katya, a schoolgirl of fifteen; both of them were sitting on a
      bench undressing. Marya Konstantinovna was a good-natured, enthusiastic,
      and genteel person, who talked in a drawling and pathetic voice. She had
      been a governess until she was thirty-two, and then had married Bityugov,
      a Government official—a bald little man with his hair combed on to
      his temples and with a very meek disposition. She was still in love with
      him, was jealous, blushed at the word “love,” and told every
      one she was very happy.

 “My dear,” she cried enthusiastically, on seeing Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna, assuming an expression which all her acquaintances called
      “almond-oily.” “My dear, how delightful that you have
      come! We’ll bathe together —that’s enchanting!”

 Olga quickly flung off her dress and chemise, and began undressing her
      mistress.

 “It’s not quite so hot to-day as yesterday?” said
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, shrinking at the coarse touch of the naked cook.
      “Yesterday I almost died of the heat.”

 “Oh, yes, my dear; I could hardly breathe myself. Would you believe
      it? I bathed yesterday three times! Just imagine, my dear, three times!
      Nikodim Alexandritch was quite uneasy.”

 “Is it possible to be so ugly?” thought Nadyezhda Fyodorovna,
      looking at Olga and the official’s wife; she glanced at Katya and
      thought: “The little girl’s not badly made.”

 “Your Nikodim Alexandritch is very charming!” she said.
      “I’m simply in love with him.”

 “Ha, ha, ha!” cried Marya Konstantinovna, with a forced laugh;
      “that’s quite enchanting.”

 Free from her clothes, Nadyezhda Fyodorovna felt a desire to fly. And it
      seemed to her that if she were to wave her hands she would fly upwards.
      When she was undressed, she noticed that Olga looked scornfully at her
      white body. Olga, a young soldier’s wife, was living with her lawful
      husband, and so considered herself superior to her mistress. Marya
      Konstantinovna and Katya were afraid of her, and did not respect her. This
      was disagreeable, and to raise herself in their opinion, Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna said:

 “At home, in Petersburg, summer villa life is at its height now. My
      husband and I have so many friends! We ought to go and see them.”

 “I believe your husband is an engineer?” said Marya
      Konstantinovna timidly.

 “I am speaking of Laevsky. He has a great many acquaintances. But
      unfortunately his mother is a proud aristocrat, not very intelligent. . .
      .”

 Nadyezhda Fyodorovna threw herself into the water without finishing; Marya
      Konstantinovna and Katya made their way in after her.

 “There are so many conventional ideas in the world,” Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna went on, “and life is not so easy as it seems.”

 Marya Konstantinovna, who had been a governess in aristocratic families
      and who was an authority on social matters, said:

 “Oh yes! Would you believe me, my dear, at the Garatynskys’ I
      was expected to dress for lunch as well as for dinner, so that, like an
      actress, I received a special allowance for my wardrobe in addition to my
      salary.”

 She stood between Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and Katya as though to screen her
      daughter from the water that washed the former.

 Through the open doors looking out to the sea they could see some one
      swimming a hundred paces from their bathing-place.

 “Mother, it’s our Kostya,” said Katya.

 “Ach, ach!” Marya Konstantinovna cackled in her dismay.
      “Ach, Kostya!” she shouted, “Come back! Kostya, come
      back!”

 Kostya, a boy of fourteen, to show off his prowess before his mother and
      sister, dived and swam farther, but began to be exhausted and hurried
      back, and from his strained and serious face it could be seen that he
      could not trust his own strength.

 “The trouble one has with these boys, my dear!” said Marya
      Konstantinovna, growing calmer. “Before you can turn round, he will
      break his neck. Ah, my dear, how sweet it is, and yet at the same time how
      difficult, to be a mother! One’s afraid of everything.”

 Nadyezhda Fyodorovna put on her straw hat and dashed out into the open
      sea. She swam some thirty feet and then turned on her back. She could see
      the sea to the horizon, the steamers, the people on the sea-front, the
      town; and all this, together with the sultry heat and the soft,
      transparent waves, excited her and whispered that she must live, live. . .
      . A sailing-boat darted by her rapidly and vigorously, cleaving the waves
      and the air; the man sitting at the helm looked at her, and she liked
      being looked at. . . .

 After bathing, the ladies dressed and went away together.

 “I have fever every alternate day, and yet I don’t get thin,”
      said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, licking her lips, which were salt from the
      bathe, and responding with a smile to the bows of her acquaintances.
      “I’ve always been plump, and now I believe I’m plumper
      than ever.”

 “That, my dear, is constitutional. If, like me, one has no
      constitutional tendency to stoutness, no diet is of any use. . . . But you’ve
      wetted your hat, my dear.”

 “It doesn’t matter; it will dry.”

 Nadyezhda Fyodorovna saw again the men in white who were walking on the
      sea-front and talking French; and again she felt a sudden thrill of joy,
      and had a vague memory of some big hall in which she had once danced, or
      of which, perhaps, she had once dreamed. And something at the bottom of
      her soul dimly and obscurely whispered to her that she was a pretty,
      common, miserable, worthless woman. . . .

 Marya Konstantinovna stopped at her gate and asked her to come in and sit
      down for a little while.

 “Come in, my dear,” she said in an imploring voice, and at the
      same time she looked at Nadyezhda Fyodorovna with anxiety and hope;
      perhaps she would refuse and not come in!

 “With pleasure,” said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, accepting. “You
      know how I love being with you!”

 And she went into the house. Marya Konstantinovna sat her down and gave
      her coffee, regaled her with milk rolls, then showed her photographs of
      her former pupils, the Garatynskys, who were by now married. She showed
      her, too, the examination reports of Kostya and Katya. The reports were
      very good, but to make them seem even better, she complained, with a sigh,
      how difficult the lessons at school were now. . . . She made much of her
      visitor, and was sorry for her, though at the same time she was harassed
      by the thought that Nadyezhda Fyodorovna might have a corrupting influence
      on the morals of Kostya and Katya, and was glad that her Nikodim
      Alexandritch was not at home. Seeing that in her opinion all men are fond
      of “women like that,” Nadyezhda Fyodorovna might have a bad
      effect on Nikodim Alexandritch too.

 As she talked to her visitor, Marya Konstantinovna kept remembering that
      they were to have a picnic that evening, and that Von Koren had
      particularly begged her to say nothing about it to the “Japanese
      monkeys”—that is, Laevsky and Nadyezhda Fyodorovna; but she
      dropped a word about it unawares, crimsoned, and said in confusion:

 “I hope you will come too!”

 VI

 It was agreed to drive about five miles out of town on the road to the
      south, to stop near a duhan at the junction of two streams —the
      Black River and the Yellow River—and to cook fish soup. They started
      out soon after five. Foremost of the party in a char-à-banc drove
      Samoylenko and Laevsky; they were followed by Marya Konstantinovna,
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, Katya and Kostya, in a coach with three horses,
      carrying with them the crockery and a basket with provisions. In the next
      carriage came the police captain, Kirilin, and the young Atchmianov, the
      son of the shopkeeper to whom Nadyezhda Fyodorovna owed three hundred
      roubles; opposite them, huddled up on the little seat with his feet tucked
      under him, sat Nikodim Alexandritch, a neat little man with hair combed on
      to his temples. Last of all came Von Koren and the deacon; at the deacon’s
      feet stood a basket of fish.

 “R-r-right!” Samoylenko shouted at the top of his voice when
      he met a cart or a mountaineer riding on a donkey.

 “In two years’ time, when I shall have the means and the
      people ready, I shall set off on an expedition,” Von Koren was
      telling the deacon. “I shall go by the sea-coast from Vladivostok to
      the Behring Straits, and then from the Straits to the mouth of the
      Yenisei. We shall make the map, study the fauna and the flora, and make
      detailed geological, anthropological, and ethnographical researches. It
      depends upon you to go with me or not.”

 “It’s impossible,” said the deacon.

 “Why?”

 “I’m a man with ties and a family.”

 “Your wife will let you go; we will provide for her. Better still if
      you were to persuade her for the public benefit to go into a nunnery; that
      would make it possible for you to become a monk, too, and join the
      expedition as a priest. I can arrange it for you.”

 The deacon was silent.

 “Do you know your theology well?” asked the zoologist.

 “No, rather badly.”

 “H’m! . . . I can’t give you any advice on that score,
      because I don’t know much about theology myself. You give me a list
      of books you need, and I will send them to you from Petersburg in the
      winter. It will be necessary for you to read the notes of religious
      travellers, too; among them are some good ethnologists and Oriental
      scholars. When you are familiar with their methods, it will be easier for
      you to set to work. And you needn’t waste your time till you get the
      books; come to me, and we will study the compass and go through a course
      of meteorology. All that’s indispensable.”

 “To be sure . . .” muttered the deacon, and he laughed.
      “I was trying to get a place in Central Russia, and my uncle, the
      head priest, promised to help me. If I go with you I shall have troubled
      them for nothing.”

 “I don’t understand your hesitation. If you go on being an
      ordinary deacon, who is only obliged to hold a service on holidays, and on
      the other days can rest from work, you will be exactly the same as you are
      now in ten years’ time, and will have gained nothing but a beard and
      moustache; while on returning from this expedition in ten years’
      time you will be a different man, you will be enriched by the
      consciousness that something has been done by you.”

 From the ladies’ carriage came shrieks of terror and delight. The
      carriages were driving along a road hollowed in a literally overhanging
      precipitous cliff, and it seemed to every one that they were galloping
      along a shelf on a steep wall, and that in a moment the carriages would
      drop into the abyss. On the right stretched the sea; on the left was a
      rough brown wall with black blotches and red veins and with climbing
      roots; while on the summit stood shaggy fir-trees bent over, as though
      looking down in terror and curiosity. A minute later there were shrieks
      and laughter again: they had to drive under a huge overhanging rock.

 “I don’t know why the devil I’m coming with you,”
      said Laevsky. “How stupid and vulgar it is! I want to go to the
      North, to run away, to escape; but here I am, for some reason, going to
      this stupid picnic.”

 “But look, what a view!” said Samoylenko as the horses turned
      to the left, and the valley of the Yellow River came into sight and the
      stream itself gleamed in the sunlight, yellow, turbid, frantic.

 “I see nothing fine in that, Sasha,” answered Laevsky. “To
      be in continual ecstasies over nature shows poverty of imagination. In
      comparison with what my imagination can give me, all these streams and
      rocks are trash, and nothing else.”

 The carriages now were by the banks of the stream. The high mountain banks
      gradually grew closer, the valley shrank together and ended in a gorge;
      the rocky mountain round which they were driving had been piled together
      by nature out of huge rocks, pressing upon each other with such terrible
      weight, that Samoylenko could not help gasping every time he looked at
      them. The dark and beautiful mountain was cleft in places by narrow
      fissures and gorges from which came a breath of dewy moisture and mystery;
      through the gorges could be seen other mountains, brown, pink, lilac,
      smoky, or bathed in vivid sunlight. From time to time as they passed a
      gorge they caught the sound of water falling from the heights and
      splashing on the stones.

 “Ach, the damned mountains!” sighed Laevsky. “How sick I
      am of them!”

 At the place where the Black River falls into the Yellow, and the water
      black as ink stains the yellow and struggles with it, stood the Tatar
      Kerbalay’s duhan , with the Russian flag on the roof and with
      an inscription written in chalk: “The Pleasant duhan .”
      Near it was a little garden, enclosed in a hurdle fence, with tables and
      chairs set out in it, and in the midst of a thicket of wretched
      thornbushes stood a single solitary cypress, dark and beautiful.

 Kerbalay, a nimble little Tatar in a blue shirt and a white apron, was
      standing in the road, and, holding his stomach, he bowed low to welcome
      the carriages, and smiled, showing his glistening white teeth.

 “Good-evening, Kerbalay,” shouted Samoylenko. “We are
      driving on a little further, and you take along the samovar and chairs!
      Look sharp!”

 Kerbalay nodded his shaven head and muttered something, and only those
      sitting in the last carriage could hear: “We’ve got trout,
      your Excellency.”

 “Bring them, bring them!” said Von Koren.

 Five hundred paces from the duhan the carriages stopped. Samoylenko
      selected a small meadow round which there were scattered stones convenient
      for sitting on, and a fallen tree blown down by the storm with roots
      overgrown by moss and dry yellow needles. Here there was a fragile wooden
      bridge over the stream, and just opposite on the other bank there was a
      little barn for drying maize, standing on four low piles, and looking like
      the hut on hen’s legs in the fairy tale; a little ladder sloped from
      its door.

 The first impression in all was a feeling that they would never get out of
      that place again. On all sides wherever they looked, the mountains rose up
      and towered above them, and the shadows of evening were stealing rapidly,
      rapidly from the duhan and dark cypress, making the narrow winding
      valley of the Black River narrower and the mountains higher. They could
      hear the river murmuring and the unceasing chirrup of the grasshoppers.

 “Enchanting!” said Marya Konstantinovna, heaving deep sighs of
      ecstasy. “Children, look how fine! What peace!”

 “Yes, it really is fine,” assented Laevsky, who liked the
      view, and for some reason felt sad as he looked at the sky and then at the
      blue smoke rising from the chimney of the duhan . “Yes, it is
      fine,” he repeated.

 “Ivan Andreitch, describe this view,” Marya Konstantinovna
      said tearfully.

 “Why?” asked Laevsky. “The impression is better than any
      description. The wealth of sights and sounds which every one receives from
      nature by direct impression is ranted about by authors in a hideous and
      unrecognisable way.”

 “Really?” Von Koren asked coldly, choosing the biggest stone
      by the side of the water, and trying to clamber up and sit upon it.
      “Really?” he repeated, looking directly at Laevsky. “What
      of ‘Romeo and Juliet’? Or, for instance, Pushkin’s
      ‘Night in the Ukraine’? Nature ought to come and bow down at
      their feet.”

 “Perhaps,” said Laevsky, who was too lazy to think and oppose
      him. “Though what is ‘Romeo and Juliet’ after all?”
      he added after a short pause. “The beauty of poetry and holiness of
      love are simply the roses under which they try to hide its rottenness.
      Romeo is just the same sort of animal as all the rest of us.”

 “Whatever one talks to you about, you always bring it round to . . .”
      Von Koren glanced round at Katya and broke off.

 “What do I bring it round to?” asked Laevsky.

 “One tells you, for instance, how beautiful a bunch of grapes is,
      and you answer: ‘Yes, but how ugly it is when it is chewed and
      digested in one’s stomach!’ Why say that? It’s not new,
      and . . . altogether it is a queer habit.”

 Laevsky knew that Von Koren did not like him, and so was afraid of him,
      and felt in his presence as though every one were constrained and some one
      were standing behind his back. He made no answer and walked away, feeling
      sorry he had come.

 “Gentlemen, quick march for brushwood for the fire!” commanded
      Samoylenko.

 They all wandered off in different directions, and no one was left but
      Kirilin, Atchmianov, and Nikodim Alexandritch. Kerbalay brought chairs,
      spread a rug on the ground, and set a few bottles of wine.

 The police captain, Kirilin, a tall, good-looking man, who in all weathers
      wore his great-coat over his tunic, with his haughty deportment, stately
      carriage, and thick, rather hoarse voice, looked like a young provincial
      chief of police; his expression was mournful and sleepy, as though he had
      just been waked against his will.

 “What have you brought this for, you brute?” he asked
      Kerbalay, deliberately articulating each word. “I ordered you to
      give us kvarel , and what have you brought, you ugly Tatar? Eh?
      What?”

 “We have plenty of wine of our own, Yegor Alekseitch,” Nikodim
      Alexandritch observed, timidly and politely.

 “What? But I want us to have my wine, too; I’m taking part in
      the picnic and I imagine I have full right to contribute my share. I
      im-ma-gine so! Bring ten bottles of kvarel .”

 “Why so many?” asked Nikodim Alexandritch, in wonder, knowing
      Kirilin had no money.

 “Twenty bottles! Thirty!” shouted Kirilin.

 “Never mind, let him,” Atchmianov whispered to Nikodim
      Alexandritch; “I’ll pay.”

 Nadyezhda Fyodorovna was in a light-hearted, mischievous mood; she wanted
      to skip and jump, to laugh, to shout, to tease, to flirt. In her cheap
      cotton dress with blue pansies on it, in her red shoes and the same straw
      hat, she seemed to herself, little, simple, light, ethereal as a
      butterfly. She ran over the rickety bridge and looked for a minute into
      the water, in order to feel giddy; then, shrieking and laughing, ran to
      the other side to the drying-shed, and she fancied that all the men were
      admiring her, even Kerbalay. When in the rapidly falling darkness the
      trees began to melt into the mountains and the horses into the carriages,
      and a light gleamed in the windows of the duhan , she climbed up the
      mountain by the little path which zigzagged between stones and
      thorn-bushes and sat on a stone. Down below, the camp-fire was burning.
      Near the fire, with his sleeves tucked up, the deacon was moving to and
      fro, and his long black shadow kept describing a circle round it; he put
      on wood, and with a spoon tied to a long stick he stirred the cauldron.
      Samoylenko, with a copper-red face, was fussing round the fire just as
      though he were in his own kitchen, shouting furiously:

 “Where’s the salt, gentlemen? I bet you’ve forgotten it.
      Why are you all sitting about like lords while I do the work?”

 Laevsky and Nikodim Alexandritch were sitting side by side on the fallen
      tree looking pensively at the fire. Marya Konstantinovna, Katya, and
      Kostya were taking the cups, saucers, and plates out of the baskets. Von
      Koren, with his arms folded and one foot on a stone, was standing on a
      bank at the very edge of the water, thinking about something. Patches of
      red light from the fire moved together with the shadows over the ground
      near the dark human figures, and quivered on the mountain, on the trees,
      on the bridge, on the drying-shed; on the other side the steep,
      scooped-out bank was all lighted up and glimmering in the stream, and the
      rushing turbid water broke its reflection into little bits.

 The deacon went for the fish which Kerbalay was cleaning and washing on
      the bank, but he stood still half-way and looked about him.

 “My God, how nice it is!” he thought. “People, rocks,
      the fire, the twilight, a monstrous tree—nothing more, and yet how
      fine it is!”

 On the further bank some unknown persons made their appearance near the
      drying-shed. The flickering light and the smoke from the camp-fire puffing
      in that direction made it impossible to get a full view of them all at
      once, but glimpses were caught now of a shaggy hat and a grey beard, now
      of a blue shirt, now of a figure, ragged from shoulder to knee, with a
      dagger across the body; then a swarthy young face with black eyebrows, as
      thick and bold as though they had been drawn in charcoal. Five of them sat
      in a circle on the ground, and the other five went into the drying-shed.
      One was standing at the door with his back to the fire, and with his hands
      behind his back was telling something, which must have been very
      interesting, for when Samoylenko threw on twigs and the fire flared up,
      and scattered sparks and threw a glaring light on the shed, two calm
      countenances with an expression on them of deep attention could be seen,
      looking out of the door, while those who were sitting in a circle turned
      round and began listening to the speaker. Soon after, those sitting in a
      circle began softly singing something slow and melodious, that sounded
      like Lenten Church music. . . . Listening to them, the deacon imagined how
      it would be with him in ten years’ time, when he would come back
      from the expedition: he would be a young priest and monk, an author with a
      name and a splendid past; he would be consecrated an archimandrite, then a
      bishop; and he would serve mass in the cathedral; in a golden mitre he
      would come out into the body of the church with the ikon on his breast,
      and blessing the mass of the people with the triple and the double
      candelabra, would proclaim: “Look down from Heaven, O God, behold
      and visit this vineyard which Thy Hand has planted,” and the
      children with their angel voices would sing in response: “Holy God.
      . .”

 “Deacon, where is that fish?” he heard Samoylenko’s
      voice.

 As he went back to the fire, the deacon imagined the Church procession
      going along a dusty road on a hot July day; in front the peasants carrying
      the banners and the women and children the ikons, then the boy choristers
      and the sacristan with his face tied up and a straw in his hair, then in
      due order himself, the deacon, and behind him the priest wearing his calotte and carrying a cross, and behind them, tramping in the dust, a crowd of
      peasants—men, women, and children; in the crowd his wife and the
      priest’s wife with kerchiefs on their heads. The choristers sing,
      the babies cry, the corncrakes call, the lark carols. . . . Then they make
      a stand and sprinkle the herd with holy water. . . . They go on again, and
      then kneeling pray for rain. Then lunch and talk. . . .

 “And that’s nice too . . .” thought the deacon.

 VII

 Kirilin and Atchmianov climbed up the mountain by the path. Atchmianov
      dropped behind and stopped, while Kirilin went up to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna.

 “Good-evening,” he said, touching his cap.

 “Good-evening.”

 “Yes!” said Kirilin, looking at the sky and pondering.

 “Why ‘yes’?” asked Nadyezhda Fyodorovna after a
      brief pause, noticing that Atchmianov was watching them both.

 “And so it seems,” said the officer, slowly, “that our
      love has withered before it has blossomed, so to speak. How do you wish me
      to understand it? Is it a sort of coquetry on your part, or do you look
      upon me as a nincompoop who can be treated as you choose.”

 “It was a mistake! Leave me alone!” Nadyezhda Fyodorovna said
      sharply, on that beautiful, marvellous evening, looking at him with terror
      and asking herself with bewilderment, could there really have been a
      moment when that man attracted her and had been near to her?

 “So that’s it!” said Kirilin; he thought in silence for
      a few minutes and said: “Well, I’ll wait till you are in a
      better humour, and meanwhile I venture to assure you I am a gentleman, and
      I don’t allow any one to doubt it. Adieu!”

 He touched his cap again and walked off, making his way between the
      bushes. After a short interval Atchmianov approached hesitatingly.

 “What a fine evening!” he said with a slight Armenian accent.

 He was nice-looking, fashionably dressed, and behaved unaffectedly like a
      well-bred youth, but Nadyezhda Fyodorovna did not like him because she
      owed his father three hundred roubles; it was displeasing to her, too,
      that a shopkeeper had been asked to the picnic, and she was vexed at his
      coming up to her that evening when her heart felt so pure.

 “The picnic is a success altogether,” he said, after a pause.

 “Yes,” she agreed, and as though suddenly remembering her
      debt, she said carelessly: “Oh, tell them in your shop that Ivan
      Andreitch will come round in a day or two and will pay three hundred
      roubles . . . . I don’t remember exactly what it is.”

 “I would give another three hundred if you would not mention that
      debt every day. Why be prosaic?”

 Nadyezhda Fyodorovna laughed; the amusing idea occurred to her that if she
      had been willing and sufficiently immoral she might in one minute be free
      from her debt. If she, for instance, were to turn the head of this
      handsome young fool! How amusing, absurd, wild it would be really! And she
      suddenly felt a longing to make him love her, to plunder him, throw him
      over, and then to see what would come of it.

 “Allow me to give you one piece of advice,” Atchmianov said
      timidly. “I beg you to beware of Kirilin. He says horrible things
      about you everywhere.”

 “It doesn’t interest me to know what every fool says of me,”
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna said coldly, and the amusing thought of playing with
      handsome young Atchmianov suddenly lost its charm.

 “We must go down,” she said; “they’re calling us.”

 The fish soup was ready by now. They were ladling it out by platefuls, and
      eating it with the religious solemnity with which this is only done at a
      picnic; and every one thought the fish soup very good, and thought that at
      home they had never eaten anything so nice. As is always the case at
      picnics, in the mass of dinner napkins, parcels, useless greasy papers
      fluttering in the wind, no one knew where was his glass or where his
      bread. They poured the wine on the carpet and on their own knees, spilt
      the salt, while it was dark all round them and the fire burnt more dimly,
      and every one was too lazy to get up and put wood on. They all drank wine,
      and even gave Kostya and Katya half a glass each. Nadyezhda Fyodorovna
      drank one glass and then another, got a little drunk and forgot about
      Kirilin.

 “A splendid picnic, an enchanting evening,” said Laevsky,
      growing lively with the wine. “But I should prefer a fine winter to
      all this. ‘His beaver collar is silver with hoar-frost.’”

 “Every one to his taste,” observed Von Koren.

 Laevsky felt uncomfortable; the heat of the campfire was beating upon his
      back, and the hatred of Von Koren upon his breast and face: this hatred on
      the part of a decent, clever man, a feeling in which there probably lay
      hid a well-grounded reason, humiliated him and enervated him, and unable
      to stand up against it, he said in a propitiatory tone:

 “I am passionately fond of nature, and I regret that I’m not a
      naturalist. I envy you.”

 “Well, I don’t envy you, and don’t regret it,”
      said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna. “I don’t understand how any one can
      seriously interest himself in beetles and ladybirds while the people are
      suffering.”

 Laevsky shared her opinion. He was absolutely ignorant of natural science,
      and so could never reconcile himself to the authoritative tone and the
      learned and profound air of the people who devoted themselves to the
      whiskers of ants and the claws of beetles, and he always felt vexed that
      these people, relying on these whiskers, claws, and something they called
      protoplasm (he always imagined it in the form of an oyster), should
      undertake to decide questions involving the origin and life of man. But in
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna’s words he heard a note of falsity, and simply
      to contradict her he said: “The point is not the ladybirds, but the
      deductions made from them.”

 VIII

 It was late, eleven o’clock, when they began to get into the
      carriages to go home. They took their seats, and the only ones missing
      were Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and Atchmianov, who were running after one
      another, laughing, the other side of the stream.

 “Make haste, my friends,” shouted Samoylenko.

 “You oughtn’t to give ladies wine,” said Von Koren in a
      low voice.

 Laevsky, exhausted by the picnic, by the hatred of Von Koren, and by his
      own thoughts, went to meet Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, and when, gay and happy,
      feeling light as a feather, breathless and laughing, she took him by both
      hands and laid her head on his breast, he stepped back and said dryly:

 “You are behaving like a . . . cocotte.”

 It sounded horribly coarse, so that he felt sorry for her at once. On his
      angry, exhausted face she read hatred, pity and vexation with himself, and
      her heart sank at once. She realised instantly that she had gone too far,
      had been too free and easy in her behaviour, and overcome with misery,
      feeling herself heavy, stout, coarse, and drunk, she got into the first
      empty carriage together with Atchmianov. Laevsky got in with Kirilin, the
      zoologist with Samoylenko, the deacon with the ladies, and the party set
      off.

 “You see what the Japanese monkeys are like,” Von Koren began,
      rolling himself up in his cloak and shutting his eyes. “You heard
      she doesn’t care to take an interest in beetles and ladybirds
      because the people are suffering. That’s how all the Japanese
      monkeys look upon people like us. They’re a slavish, cunning race,
      terrified by the whip and the fist for ten generations; they tremble and
      burn incense only before violence; but let the monkey into a free state
      where there’s no one to take it by the collar, and it relaxes at
      once and shows itself in its true colours. Look how bold they are in
      picture galleries, in museums, in theatres, or when they talk of science:
      they puff themselves out and get excited, they are abusive and critical .
      . . they are bound to criticise—it’s the sign of the slave.
      You listen: men of the liberal professions are more often sworn at than
      pickpockets—that’s because three-quarters of society are made
      up of slaves, of just such monkeys. It never happens that a slave holds
      out his hand to you and sincerely says ‘Thank you’ to you for
      your work.”

 “I don’t know what you want,” said Samoylenko, yawning;
      “the poor thing, in the simplicity of her heart, wanted to talk to
      you of scientific subjects, and you draw a conclusion from that. You’re
      cross with him for something or other, and with her, too, to keep him
      company. She’s a splendid woman.”

 “Ah, nonsense! An ordinary kept woman, depraved and vulgar. Listen,
      Alexandr Daviditch; when you meet a simple peasant woman, who isn’t
      living with her husband, who does nothing but giggle, you tell her to go
      and work. Why are you timid in this case and afraid to tell the truth?
      Simply because Nadyezhda Fyodorovna is kept, not by a sailor, but by an
      official.”

 “What am I to do with her?” said Samoylenko, getting angry.
      “Beat her or what?

 “Not flatter vice. We curse vice only behind its back, and that’s
      like making a long nose at it round a corner. I am a zoologist or a
      sociologist, which is the same thing; you are a doctor; society believes
      in us; we ought to point out the terrible harm which threatens it and the
      next generation from the existence of ladies like Nadyezhda Ivanovna.”

 “Fyodorovna,” Samoylenko corrected. “But what ought
      society to do?”

 “Society? That’s its affair. To my thinking the surest and
      most direct method is—compulsion. Manu militari she ought to
      be returned to her husband; and if her husband won’t take her in,
      then she ought to be sent to penal servitude or some house of correction.”

 “Ouf!” sighed Samoylenko. He paused and asked quietly: “You
      said the other day that people like Laevsky ought to be destroyed. . . .
      Tell me, if you . . . if the State or society commissioned you to destroy
      him, could you . . . bring yourself to it?”

 “My hand would not tremble.”

 IX

 When they got home, Laevsky and Nadyezhda Fyodorovna went into their dark,
      stuffy, dull rooms. Both were silent. Laevsky lighted a candle, while
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna sat down, and without taking off her cloak and hat,
      lifted her melancholy, guilty eyes to him.

 He knew that she expected an explanation from him, but an explanation
      would be wearisome, useless and exhausting, and his heart was heavy
      because he had lost control over himself and been rude to her. He chanced
      to feel in his pocket the letter which he had been intending every day to
      read to her, and thought if he were to show her that letter now, it would
      turn her thoughts in another direction.

 “It is time to define our relations,” he thought. “I
      will give it her; what is to be will be.”

 He took out the letter and gave it her.

 “Read it. It concerns you.”

 Saying this, he went into his own room and lay down on the sofa in the
      dark without a pillow. Nadyezhda Fyodorovna read the letter, and it seemed
      to her as though the ceiling were falling and the walls were closing in on
      her. It seemed suddenly dark and shut in and terrible. She crossed herself
      quickly three times and said:

 “Give him peace, O Lord . . . give him peace. . . .”

 And she began crying.

 “Vanya,” she called. “Ivan Andreitch!”

 There was no answer. Thinking that Laevsky had come in and was standing
      behind her chair, she sobbed like a child, and said:

 “Why did you not tell me before that he was dead? I wouldn’t
      have gone to the picnic; I shouldn’t have laughed so horribly. . . .
      The men said horrid things to me. What a sin, what a sin! Save me, Vanya,
      save me. . . . I have been mad. . . . I am lost. . . .”

 Laevsky heard her sobs. He felt stifled and his heart was beating
      violently. In his misery he got up, stood in the middle of the room,
      groped his way in the dark to an easy-chair by the table, and sat down.

 “This is a prison . . .” he thought. “I must get away .
      . . I can’t bear it.”

 It was too late to go and play cards; there were no restaurants in the
      town. He lay down again and covered his ears that he might not hear her
      sobbing, and he suddenly remembered that he could go to Samoylenko. To
      avoid going near Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, he got out of the window into the
      garden, climbed over the garden fence and went along the street. It was
      dark. A steamer, judging by its lights, a big passenger one, had just come
      in. He heard the clank of the anchor chain. A red light was moving rapidly
      from the shore in the direction of the steamer: it was the Customs boat
      going out to it.

 “The passengers are asleep in their cabins . . .” thought
      Laevsky, and he envied the peace of mind of other people.

 The windows in Samoylenko’s house were open. Laevsky looked in at
      one of them, then in at another; it was dark and still in the rooms.

 “Alexandr Daviditch, are you asleep?” he called. “Alexandr
      Daviditch!”

 He heard a cough and an uneasy shout:

 “Who’s there? What the devil?”

 “It is I, Alexandr Daviditch; excuse me.”

 A little later the door opened; there was a glow of soft light from the
      lamp, and Samoylenko’s huge figure appeared all in white, with a
      white nightcap on his head.

 “What now?” he asked, scratching himself and breathing hard
      from sleepiness. “Wait a minute; I’ll open the door directly.”

 “Don’t trouble; I’ll get in at the window. . . .”

 Laevsky climbed in at the window, and when he reached Samoylenko, seized
      him by the hand.

 “Alexandr Daviditch,” he said in a shaking voice, “save
      me! I beseech you, I implore you. Understand me! My position is agonising.
      If it goes on for another two days I shall strangle myself like . . . like
      a dog.”

 “Wait a bit. . . . What are you talking about exactly?”

 “Light a candle.”

 “Oh . . . oh! . . .” sighed Samoylenko, lighting a candle.
      “My God! My God! . . . Why, it’s past one, brother.”

 “Excuse me, but I can’t stay at home,” said Laevsky,
      feeling great comfort from the light and the presence of Samoylenko.
      “You are my best, my only friend, Alexandr Daviditch. . . . You are
      my only hope. For God’s sake, come to my rescue, whether you want to
      or not. I must get away from here, come what may! . . . Lend me the money!”

 “Oh, my God, my God! . . .” sighed Samoylenko, scratching
      himself. “I was dropping asleep and I hear the whistle of the
      steamer, and now you . . . Do you want much?”

 “Three hundred roubles at least. I must leave her a hundred, and I
      need two hundred for the journey. . . . I owe you about four hundred
      already, but I will send it you all . . . all. . . .”

 Samoylenko took hold of both his whiskers in one hand, and standing with
      his legs wide apart, pondered.

 “Yes . . .” he muttered, musing. “Three hundred. . . .
      Yes. . . . But I haven’t got so much. I shall have to borrow it from
      some one.”

 “Borrow it, for God’s sake!” said Laevsky, seeing from
      Samoylenko’s face that he wanted to lend him the money and certainly
      would lend it. “Borrow it, and I’ll be sure to pay you back. I
      will send it from Petersburg as soon as I get there. You can set your mind
      at rest about that. I’ll tell you what, Sasha,” he said,
      growing more animated; “let us have some wine.”

 “Yes . . . we can have some wine, too.”

 They both went into the dining-room.

 “And how about Nadyezhda Fyodorovna?” asked Samoylenko,
      setting three bottles and a plate of peaches on the table. “Surely
      she’s not remaining?”

 “I will arrange it all, I will arrange it all,” said Laevsky,
      feeling an unexpected rush of joy. “I will send her the money
      afterwards and she will join me. . . . Then we will define our relations.
      To your health, friend.”

 “Wait a bit,” said Samoylenko. “Drink this first. . . .
      This is from my vineyard. This bottle is from Navaridze’s vineyard
      and this one is from Ahatulov’s. . . . Try all three kinds and tell
      me candidly. . . . There seems a little acidity about mine. Eh? Don’t
      you taste it?”

 “Yes. You have comforted me, Alexandr Daviditch. Thank you. . . . I
      feel better.”

 “Is there any acidity?”

 “Goodness only knows, I don’t know. But you are a splendid,
      wonderful man!”

 Looking at his pale, excited, good-natured face, Samoylenko remembered Von
      Koren’s view that men like that ought to be destroyed, and Laevsky
      seemed to him a weak, defenceless child, whom any one could injure and
      destroy.

 “And when you go, make it up with your mother,” he said.
      “It’s not right.”

 “Yes, yes; I certainly shall.”

 They were silent for a while. When they had emptied the first bottle,
      Samoylenko said:

 “You ought to make it up with Von Koren too. You are both such
      splendid, clever fellows, and you glare at each other like wolves.”

 “Yes, he’s a fine, very intelligent fellow,” Laevsky
      assented, ready now to praise and forgive every one. “He’s a
      remarkable man, but it’s impossible for me to get on with him. No!
      Our natures are too different. I’m an indolent, weak, submissive
      nature. Perhaps in a good minute I might hold out my hand to him, but he
      would turn away from me . . . with contempt.”

 Laevsky took a sip of wine, walked from corner to corner and went on,
      standing in the middle of the room:

 “I understand Von Koren very well. His is a resolute, strong,
      despotic nature. You have heard him continually talking of ‘the
      expedition,’ and it’s not mere talk. He wants the wilderness,
      the moonlit night: all around in little tents, under the open sky, lie
      sleeping his sick and hungry Cossacks, guides, porters, doctor, priest,
      all exhausted with their weary marches, while only he is awake, sitting
      like Stanley on a camp-stool, feeling himself the monarch of the desert
      and the master of these men. He goes on and on and on, his men groan and
      die, one after another, and he goes on and on, and in the end perishes
      himself, but still is monarch and ruler of the desert, since the cross
      upon his tomb can be seen by the caravans for thirty or forty miles over
      the desert. I am sorry the man is not in the army. He would have made a
      splendid military genius. He would not have hesitated to drown his cavalry
      in the river and make a bridge out of dead bodies. And such hardihood is
      more needed in war than any kind of fortification or strategy. Oh, I
      understand him perfectly! Tell me: why is he wasting his substance here?
      What does he want here?”

 “He is studying the marine fauna.”

 “No, no, brother, no!” Laevsky sighed. “A scientific man
      who was on the steamer told me the Black Sea was poor in animal life, and
      that in its depths, thanks to the abundance of sulphuric hydrogen, organic
      life was impossible. All the serious zoologists work at the biological
      station at Naples or Villefranche. But Von Koren is independent and
      obstinate: he works on the Black Sea because nobody else is working there;
      he is at loggerheads with the university, does not care to know his
      comrades and other scientific men because he is first of all a despot and
      only secondly a zoologist. And you’ll see he’ll do something.
      He is already dreaming that when he comes back from his expedition he will
      purify our universities from intrigue and mediocrity, and will make the
      scientific men mind their p’s and q’s. Despotism is just as
      strong in science as in the army. And he is spending his second summer in
      this stinking little town because he would rather be first in a village
      than second in a town. Here he is a king and an eagle; he keeps all the
      inhabitants under his thumb and oppresses them with his authority. He has
      appropriated every one, he meddles in other people’s affairs;
      everything is of use to him, and every one is afraid of him. I am slipping
      out of his clutches, he feels that and hates me. Hasn’t he told you
      that I ought to be destroyed or sent to hard labour?”

 “Yes,” laughed Samoylenko.

 Laevsky laughed too, and drank some wine.

 “His ideals are despotic too,” he said, laughing, and biting a
      peach. “Ordinary mortals think of their neighbour—me, you, man
      in fact—if they work for the common weal. To Von Koren men are
      puppets and nonentities, too trivial to be the object of his life. He
      works, will go for his expedition and break his neck there, not for the
      sake of love for his neighbour, but for the sake of such abstractions as
      humanity, future generations, an ideal race of men. He exerts himself for
      the improvement of the human race, and we are in his eyes only slaves,
      food for the cannon, beasts of burden; some he would destroy or stow away
      in Siberia, others he would break by discipline, would, like Araktcheev,
      force them to get up and go to bed to the sound of the drum; would appoint
      eunuchs to preserve our chastity and morality, would order them to fire at
      any one who steps out of the circle of our narrow conservative morality;
      and all this in the name of the improvement of the human race. . . . And
      what is the human race? Illusion, mirage . . . despots have always been
      illusionists. I understand him very well, brother. I appreciate him and
      don’t deny his importance; this world rests on men like him, and if
      the world were left only to such men as us, for all our good-nature and
      good intentions, we should make as great a mess of it as the flies have of
      that picture. Yes.”

 Laevsky sat down beside Samoylenko, and said with genuine feeling: “I’m
      a foolish, worthless, depraved man. The air I breathe, this wine, love,
      life in fact—for all that, I have given nothing in exchange so far
      but lying, idleness, and cowardice. Till now I have deceived myself and
      other people; I have been miserable about it, and my misery was cheap and
      common. I bow my back humbly before Von Koren’s hatred because at
      times I hate and despise myself.”

 Laevsky began again pacing from one end of the room to the other in
      excitement, and said:

 “I’m glad I see my faults clearly and am conscious of them.
      That will help me to reform and become a different man. My dear fellow, if
      only you knew how passionately, with what anguish, I long for such a
      change. And I swear to you I’ll be a man! I will! I don’t know
      whether it is the wine that is speaking in me, or whether it really is so,
      but it seems to me that it is long since I have spent such pure and lucid
      moments as I have just now with you.”

 “It’s time to sleep, brother,” said Samoylenko.

 “Yes, yes. . . . Excuse me; I’ll go directly.”

 Laevsky moved hurriedly about the furniture and windows, looking for his
      cap.

 “Thank you,” he muttered, sighing. “Thank you. . . .
      Kind and friendly words are better than charity. You have given me new
      life.”

 He found his cap, stopped, and looked guiltily at Samoylenko.

 “Alexandr Daviditch,” he said in an imploring voice.

 “What is it?”

 “Let me stay the night with you, my dear fellow!”

 “Certainly. . . . Why not?”

 Laevsky lay down on the sofa, and went on talking to the doctor for a long
      time.

 X

 Three days after the picnic, Marya Konstantinovna unexpectedly called on
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, and without greeting her or taking off her hat,
      seized her by both hands, pressed them to her breast and said in great
      excitement:

 “My dear, I am deeply touched and moved: our dear kind-hearted
      doctor told my Nikodim Alexandritch yesterday that your husband was dead.
      Tell me, my dear . . . tell me, is it true?”

 “Yes, it’s true; he is dead,” answered Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna.

 “That is awful, awful, my dear! But there’s no evil without
      some compensation; your husband was no doubt a noble, wonderful, holy man,
      and such are more needed in Heaven than on earth.”

 Every line and feature in Marya Konstantinovna’s face began
      quivering as though little needles were jumping up and down under her
      skin; she gave an almond-oily smile and said, breathlessly,
      enthusiastically:

 “And so you are free, my dear. You can hold your head high now, and
      look people boldly in the face. Henceforth God and man will bless your
      union with Ivan Andreitch. It’s enchanting. I am trembling with joy,
      I can find no words. My dear, I will give you away. . . . Nikodim
      Alexandritch and I have been so fond of you, you will allow us to give our
      blessing to your pure, lawful union. When, when do you think of being
      married?”

 “I haven’t thought of it,” said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna,
      freeing her hands.

 “That’s impossible, my dear. You have thought of it, you have.”

 “Upon my word, I haven’t,” said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna,
      laughing. “What should we be married for? I see no necessity for it.
      We’ll go on living as we have lived.”

 “What are you saying!” cried Marya Konstantinovna in horror.
      “For God’s sake, what are you saying!”

 “Our getting married won’t make things any better. On the
      contrary, it will make them even worse. We shall lose our freedom.”

 “My dear, my dear, what are you saying!” exclaimed Marya
      Konstantinovna, stepping back and flinging up her hands. “You are
      talking wildly! Think what you are saying. You must settle down!”

 “‘Settle down.’ How do you mean? I have not lived yet,
      and you tell me to settle down.”

 Nadyezhda Fyodorovna reflected that she really had not lived. She had
      finished her studies in a boarding-school and had been married to a man
      she did not love; then she had thrown in her lot with Laevsky, and had
      spent all her time with him on this empty, desolate coast, always
      expecting something better. Was that life?

 “I ought to be married though,” she thought, but remembering
      Kirilin and Atchmianov she flushed and said:

 “No, it’s impossible. Even if Ivan Andreitch begged me to on
      his knees—even then I would refuse.”

 Marya Konstantinovna sat on the sofa for a minute in silence, grave and
      mournful, gazing fixedly into space; then she got up and said coldly:

 “Good-bye, my dear! Forgive me for having troubled you. Though it’s
      not easy for me, it’s my duty to tell you that from this day all is
      over between us, and, in spite of my profound respect for Ivan Andreitch,
      the door of my house is closed to you henceforth.”

 She uttered these words with great solemnity and was herself overwhelmed
      by her solemn tone. Her face began quivering again; it assumed a soft
      almond-oily expression. She held out both hands to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna,
      who was overcome with alarm and confusion, and said in an imploring voice:

 “My dear, allow me if only for a moment to be a mother or an elder
      sister to you! I will be as frank with you as a mother.”

 Nadyezhda Fyodorovna felt in her bosom warmth, gladness, and pity for
      herself, as though her own mother had really risen up and were standing
      before her. She impulsively embraced Marya Konstantinovna and pressed her
      face to her shoulder. Both of them shed tears. They sat down on the sofa
      and for a few minutes sobbed without looking at one another or being able
      to utter a word.

 “My dear child,” began Marya Konstantinovna, “I will
      tell you some harsh truths, without sparing you.”

 “For God’s sake, for God’s sake, do!”

 “Trust me, my dear. You remember of all the ladies here, I was the
      only one to receive you. You horrified me from the very first day, but I
      had not the heart to treat you with disdain like all the rest. I grieved
      over dear, good Ivan Andreitch as though he were my son —a young man
      in a strange place, inexperienced, weak, with no mother; and I was
      worried, dreadfully worried. . . . My husband was opposed to our making
      his acquaintance, but I talked him over . . . persuaded him. . . . We
      began receiving Ivan Andreitch, and with him, of course, you. If we had
      not, he would have been insulted. I have a daughter, a son. . . . You
      understand the tender mind, the pure heart of childhood . . . ‘who
      so offendeth one of these little ones.’ . . . I received you into my
      house and trembled for my children. Oh, when you become a mother, you will
      understand my fears. And every one was surprised at my receiving you,
      excuse my saying so, as a respectable woman, and hinted to me . . . well,
      of course, slanders, suppositions. . . . At the bottom of my heart I
      blamed you, but you were unhappy, flighty, to be pitied, and my heart was
      wrung with pity for you.”

 “But why, why?” asked Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, trembling all
      over. “What harm have I done any one?”

 “You are a terrible sinner. You broke the vow you made your husband
      at the altar. You seduced a fine young man, who perhaps had he not met you
      might have taken a lawful partner for life from a good family in his own
      circle, and would have been like every one else now. You have ruined his
      youth. Don’t speak, don’t speak, my dear! I never believe that
      man is to blame for our sins. It is always the woman’s fault. Men
      are frivolous in domestic life; they are guided by their minds, and not by
      their hearts. There’s a great deal they don’t understand;
      woman understands it all. Everything depends on her. To her much is given
      and from her much will be required. Oh, my dear, if she had been more
      foolish or weaker than man on that side, God would not have entrusted her
      with the education of boys and girls. And then, my dear, you entered on
      the path of vice, forgetting all modesty; any other woman in your place
      would have hidden herself from people, would have sat shut up at home, and
      would only have been seen in the temple of God, pale, dressed all in black
      and weeping, and every one would have said in genuine compassion: ‘O
      Lord, this erring angel is coming back again to Thee . . . .’ But
      you, my dear, have forgotten all discretion; have lived openly,
      extravagantly; have seemed to be proud of your sin; you have been gay and
      laughing, and I, looking at you, shuddered with horror, and have been
      afraid that thunder from Heaven would strike our house while you were
      sitting with us. My dear, don’t speak, don’t speak,”
      cried Marya Konstantinovna, observing that Nadyezhda Fyodorovna wanted to
      speak. “Trust me, I will not deceive you, I will not hide one truth
      from the eyes of your soul. Listen to me, my dear. . . . God marks great
      sinners, and you have been marked-out: only think—your costumes have
      always been appalling.”

 Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, who had always had the highest opinion of her
      costumes, left off crying and looked at her with surprise.

 “Yes, appalling,” Marya Konstantinovna went on. “Any one
      could judge of your behaviour from the elaboration and gaudiness of your
      attire. People laughed and shrugged their shoulders as they looked at you,
      and I grieved, I grieved. . . . And forgive me, my dear; you are not nice
      in your person! When we met in the bathing-place, you made me tremble.
      Your outer clothing was decent enough, but your petticoat, your chemise. .
      . . My dear, I blushed! Poor Ivan Andreitch! No one ever ties his cravat
      properly, and from his linen and his boots, poor fellow! one can see he
      has no one at home to look after him. And he is always hungry, my darling,
      and of course, if there is no one at home to think of the samovar and the
      coffee, one is forced to spend half one’s salary at the pavilion.
      And it’s simply awful, awful in your home! No one else in the town
      has flies, but there’s no getting rid of them in your rooms: all the
      plates and dishes are black with them. If you look at the windows and the
      chairs, there’s nothing but dust, dead flies, and glasses. . . .
      What do you want glasses standing about for? And, my dear, the table’s
      not cleared till this time in the day. And one’s ashamed to go into
      your bedroom: underclothes flung about everywhere, india-rubber tubes
      hanging on the walls, pails and basins standing about. . . . My dear! A
      husband ought to know nothing, and his wife ought to be as neat as a
      little angel in his presence. I wake up every morning before it is light,
      and wash my face with cold water that my Nikodim Alexandritch may not see
      me looking drowsy.”

 “That’s all nonsense,” Nadyezhda Fyodorovna sobbed.
      “If only I were happy, but I am so unhappy!”

 “Yes, yes; you are very unhappy!” Marya Konstantinovna sighed,
      hardly able to restrain herself from weeping. “And there’s
      terrible grief in store for you in the future! A solitary old age,
      ill-health; and then you will have to answer at the dread judgment seat. .
      . It’s awful, awful. Now fate itself holds out to you a helping
      hand, and you madly thrust it from you. Be married, make haste and be
      married!”

 “Yes, we must, we must,” said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna; “but
      it’s impossible!”

 “Why?”

 “It’s impossible. Oh, if only you knew!”

 Nadyezhda Fyodorovna had an impulse to tell her about Kirilin, and how the
      evening before she had met handsome young Atchmianov at the harbour, and
      how the mad, ridiculous idea had occurred to her of cancelling her debt
      for three hundred; it had amused her very much, and she returned home late
      in the evening feeling that she had sold herself and was irrevocably lost.
      She did not know herself how it had happened. And she longed to swear to
      Marya Konstantinovna that she would certainly pay that debt, but sobs and
      shame prevented her from speaking.

 “I am going away,” she said. “Ivan Andreitch may stay,
      but I am going.”

 “Where?”

 “To Russia.”

 “But how will you live there? Why, you have nothing.”

 “I will do translation, or . . . or I will open a library . . . .”

 “Don’t let your fancy run away with you, my dear. You must
      have money for a library. Well, I will leave you now, and you calm
      yourself and think things over, and to-morrow come and see me, bright and
      happy. That will be enchanting! Well, good-bye, my angel. Let me kiss you.”

 Marya Konstantinovna kissed Nadyezhda Fyodorovna on the forehead, made the
      sign of the cross over her, and softly withdrew. It was getting dark, and
      Olga lighted up in the kitchen. Still crying, Nadyezhda Fyodorovna went
      into the bedroom and lay down on the bed. She began to be very feverish.
      She undressed without getting up, crumpled up her clothes at her feet, and
      curled herself up under the bedclothes. She was thirsty, and there was no
      one to give her something to drink.

 “I’ll pay it back!” she said to herself, and it seemed
      to her in delirium that she was sitting beside some sick woman, and
      recognised her as herself. “I’ll pay it back. It would be
      stupid to imagine that it was for money I . . . I will go away and send
      him the money from Petersburg. At first a hundred . . . then another
      hundred . . . and then the third hundred. . . .”

 It was late at night when Laevsky came in.

 “At first a hundred . . .” Nadyezhda Fyodorovna said to him,
      “then another hundred . . .”

 “You ought to take some quinine,” he said, and thought,
      “To-morrow is Wednesday; the steamer goes and I am not going in it.
      So I shall have to go on living here till Saturday.”

 Nadyezhda Fyodorovna knelt up in bed.

 “I didn’t say anything just now, did I?” she asked,
      smiling and screwing up her eyes at the light.

 “No, nothing. We shall have to send for the doctor to-morrow
      morning. Go to sleep.”

 He took his pillow and went to the door. Ever since he had finally made up
      his mind to go away and leave Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, she had begun to raise
      in him pity and a sense of guilt; he felt a little ashamed in her
      presence, as though in the presence of a sick or old horse whom one has
      decided to kill. He stopped in the doorway and looked round at her.

 “I was out of humour at the picnic and said something rude to you.
      Forgive me, for God’s sake!”

 Saying this, he went off to his study, lay down, and for a long while
      could not get to sleep.

 Next morning when Samoylenko, attired, as it was a holiday, in full-dress
      uniform with epaulettes on his shoulders and decorations on his breast,
      came out of the bedroom after feeling Nadyezhda Fyodorovna’s pulse
      and looking at her tongue, Laevsky, who was standing in the doorway, asked
      him anxiously: “Well? Well?”

 There was an expression of terror, of extreme uneasiness, and of hope on
      his face.

 “Don’t worry yourself; there’s nothing dangerous,”
      said Samoylenko; “it’s the usual fever.”

 “I don’t mean that.” Laevsky frowned impatiently.
      “Have you got the money?”

 “My dear soul, forgive me,” he whispered, looking round at the
      door and overcome with confusion.

 “For God’s sake, forgive me! No one has anything to spare, and
      I’ve only been able to collect by five- and by ten-rouble notes. . .
      . Only a hundred and ten in all. To-day I’ll speak to some one else.
      Have patience.”

 “But Saturday is the latest date,” whispered Laevsky,
      trembling with impatience. “By all that’s sacred, get it by
      Saturday! If I don’t get away by Saturday, nothing’s any use,
      nothing! I can’t understand how a doctor can be without money!”

 “Lord have mercy on us!” Samoylenko whispered rapidly and
      intensely, and there was positively a breaking note in his throat. “I’ve
      been stripped of everything; I am owed seven thousand, and I’m in
      debt all round. Is it my fault?”

 “Then you’ll get it by Saturday? Yes?”

 “I’ll try.”

 “I implore you, my dear fellow! So that the money may be in my hands
      by Friday morning!”

 Samoylenko sat down and prescribed solution of quinine and kalii bromati
      and tincture of rhubarb, tincturæ gentianæ, aquæ foeniculi —all in
      one mixture, added some pink syrup to sweeten it, and went away.

 XI

 “You look as though you were coming to arrest me,” said Von
      Koren, seeing Samoylenko coming in, in his full-dress uniform.

 “I was passing by and thought: ‘Suppose I go in and pay my
      respects to zoology,’” said Samoylenko, sitting down at the
      big table, knocked together by the zoologist himself out of plain boards.
      “Good-morning, holy father,” he said to the deacon, who was
      sitting in the window, copying something. “I’ll stay a minute
      and then run home to see about dinner. It’s time. . . . I’m
      not hindering you?”

 “Not in the least,” answered the zoologist, laying out over
      the table slips of paper covered with small writing. “We are busy
      copying.”

 “Ah! . . . Oh, my goodness, my goodness! . . .” sighed
      Samoylenko. He cautiously took up from the table a dusty book on which
      there was lying a dead dried spider, and said: “Only fancy, though;
      some little green beetle is going about its business, when suddenly a
      monster like this swoops down upon it. I can fancy its terror.”

 “Yes, I suppose so.”

 “Is poison given it to protect it from its enemies?”

 “Yes, to protect it and enable it to attack.”

 “To be sure, to be sure. . . . And everything in nature, my dear
      fellows, is consistent and can be explained,” sighed Samoylenko;
      “only I tell you what I don’t understand. You’re a man
      of very great intellect, so explain it to me, please. There are, you know,
      little beasts no bigger than rats, rather handsome to look at, but nasty
      and immoral in the extreme, let me tell you. Suppose such a little beast
      is running in the woods. He sees a bird; he catches it and devours it. He
      goes on and sees in the grass a nest of eggs; he does not want to eat them—he
      is not hungry, but yet he tastes one egg and scatters the others out of
      the nest with his paw. Then he meets a frog and begins to play with it;
      when he has tormented the frog he goes on licking himself and meets a
      beetle; he crushes the beetle with his paw . . . and so he spoils and
      destroys everything on his way. . . . He creeps into other beasts’
      holes, tears up the anthills, cracks the snail’s shell. If he meets
      a rat, he fights with it; if he meets a snake or a mouse, he must strangle
      it; and so the whole day long. Come, tell me: what is the use of a beast
      like that? Why was he created?”

 “I don’t know what animal you are talking of,” said Von
      Koren; “most likely one of the insectivora. Well, he got hold of the
      bird because it was incautious; he broke the nest of eggs because the bird
      was not skilful, had made the nest badly and did not know how to conceal
      it. The frog probably had some defect in its colouring or he would not
      have seen it, and so on. Your little beast only destroys the weak, the
      unskilful, the careless—in fact, those who have defects which nature
      does not think fit to hand on to posterity. Only the cleverer, the
      stronger, the more careful and developed survive; and so your little
      beast, without suspecting it, is serving the great ends of perfecting
      creation.”

 “Yes, yes, yes. . . . By the way, brother,” said Samoylenko
      carelessly, “lend me a hundred roubles.”

 “Very good. There are some very interesting types among the
      insectivorous mammals. For instance, the mole is said to be useful because
      he devours noxious insects. There is a story that some German sent William
      I. a fur coat made of moleskins, and the Emperor ordered him to be
      reproved for having destroyed so great a number of useful animals. And yet
      the mole is not a bit less cruel than your little beast, and is very
      mischievous besides, as he spoils meadows terribly.”

 Von Koren opened a box and took out a hundred-rouble note.

 “The mole has a powerful thorax, just like the bat,” he went
      on, shutting the box; “the bones and muscles are tremendously
      developed, the mouth is extraordinarily powerfully furnished. If it had
      the proportions of an elephant, it would be an all-destructive, invincible
      animal. It is interesting when two moles meet underground; they begin at
      once as though by agreement digging a little platform; they need the
      platform in order to have a battle more conveniently. When they have made
      it they enter upon a ferocious struggle and fight till the weaker one
      falls. Take the hundred roubles,” said Von Koren, dropping his
      voice, “but only on condition that you’re not borrowing it for
      Laevsky.”

 “And if it were for Laevsky,” cried Samoylenko, flaring up,
      “what is that to you?”

 “I can’t give it to you for Laevsky. I know you like lending
      people money. You would give it to Kerim, the brigand, if he were to ask
      you; but, excuse me, I can’t assist you in that direction.”

 “Yes, it is for Laevsky I am asking it,” said Samoylenko,
      standing up and waving his right arm. “Yes! For Laevsky! And no one,
      fiend or devil, has a right to dictate to me how to dispose of my own
      money. It doesn’t suit you to lend it me? No?”

 The deacon began laughing.

 “Don’t get excited, but be reasonable,” said the
      zoologist. “To shower benefits on Mr. Laevsky is, to my thinking, as
      senseless as to water weeds or to feed locusts.”

 “To my thinking, it is our duty to help our neighbours!” cried
      Samoylenko.

 “In that case, help that hungry Turk who is lying under the fence!
      He is a workman and more useful and indispensable than your Laevsky. Give
      him that hundred-rouble note! Or subscribe a hundred roubles to my
      expedition!”

 “Will you give me the money or not? I ask you!”

 “Tell me openly: what does he want money for?”

 “It’s not a secret; he wants to go to Petersburg on Saturday.”

 “So that is it!” Von Koren drawled out. “Aha! . . . We
      understand. And is she going with him, or how is it to be?”

 “She’s staying here for the time. He’ll arrange his
      affairs in Petersburg and send her the money, and then she’ll go.”

 “That’s smart!” said the zoologist, and he gave a short
      tenor laugh. “Smart, well planned.”

 He went rapidly up to Samoylenko, and standing face to face with him, and
      looking him in the eyes, asked: “Tell me now honestly: is he tired
      of her? Yes? tell me: is he tired of her? Yes?”

 “Yes,” Samoylenko articulated, beginning to perspire.

 “How repulsive it is!” said Von Koren, and from his face it
      could be seen that he felt repulsion. “One of two things, Alexandr
      Daviditch: either you are in the plot with him, or, excuse my saying so,
      you are a simpleton. Surely you must see that he is taking you in like a
      child in the most shameless way? Why, it’s as clear as day that he
      wants to get rid of her and abandon her here. She’ll be left a
      burden on you. It is as clear as day that you will have to send her to
      Petersburg at your expense. Surely your fine friend can’t have so
      blinded you by his dazzling qualities that you can’t see the
      simplest thing?”

 “That’s all supposition,” said Samoylenko, sitting down.

 “Supposition? But why is he going alone instead of taking her with
      him? And ask him why he doesn’t send her off first. The sly beast!”

 Overcome with sudden doubts and suspicions about his friend, Samoylenko
      weakened and took a humbler tone.

 “But it’s impossible,” he said, recalling the night
      Laevsky had spent at his house. “He is so unhappy!”

 “What of that? Thieves and incendiaries are unhappy too!”

 “Even supposing you are right . . .” said Samoylenko,
      hesitating. “Let us admit it. . . . Still, he’s a young man in
      a strange place . . . a student. We have been students, too, and there is
      no one but us to come to his assistance.”

 “To help him to do abominable things, because he and you at
      different times have been at universities, and neither of you did anything
      there! What nonsense!”

 “Stop; let us talk it over coolly. I imagine it will be possible to
      make some arrangement. . . .” Samoylenko reflected, twiddling his
      fingers. “I’ll give him the money, you see, but make him
      promise on his honour that within a week he’ll send Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna the money for the journey.”

 “And he’ll give you his word of honour—in fact, he’ll
      shed tears and believe in it himself; but what’s his word of honour
      worth? He won’t keep it, and when in a year or two you meet him on
      the Nevsky Prospect with a new mistress on his arm, he’ll excuse
      himself on the ground that he has been crippled by civilisation, and that
      he is made after the pattern of Rudin. Drop him, for God’s sake!
      Keep away from the filth; don’t stir it up with both hands!”

 Samoylenko thought for a minute and said resolutely:

 “But I shall give him the money all the same. As you please. I can’t
      bring myself to refuse a man simply on an assumption.”

 “Very fine, too. You can kiss him if you like.”

 “Give me the hundred roubles, then,” Samoylenko asked timidly.

 “I won’t.”

 A silence followed. Samoylenko was quite crushed; his face wore a guilty,
      abashed, and ingratiating expression, and it was strange to see this
      pitiful, childish, shamefaced countenance on a huge man wearing epaulettes
      and orders of merit.

 “The bishop here goes the round of his diocese on horseback instead
      of in a carriage,” said the deacon, laying down his pen. “It’s
      extremely touching to see him sit on his horse. His simplicity and
      humility are full of Biblical grandeur.”

 “Is he a good man?” asked Von Koren, who was glad to change
      the conversation.

 “Of course! If he hadn’t been a good man, do you suppose he
      would have been consecrated a bishop?”

 “Among the bishops are to be found good and gifted men,” said
      Von Koren. “The only drawback is that some of them have the weakness
      to imagine themselves statesmen. One busies himself with Russification,
      another criticises the sciences. That’s not their business. They had
      much better look into their consistory a little.”

 “A layman cannot judge of bishops.”

 “Why so, deacon? A bishop is a man just the same as you or I.”

 “The same, but not the same.” The deacon was offended and took
      up his pen. “If you had been the same, the Divine Grace would have
      rested upon you, and you would have been bishop yourself; and since you
      are not bishop, it follows you are not the same.”

 “Don’t talk nonsense, deacon,” said Samoylenko
      dejectedly. “Listen to what I suggest,” he said, turning to
      Von Koren. “Don’t give me that hundred roubles. You’ll
      be having your dinners with me for three months before the winter, so let
      me have the money beforehand for three months.”

 “I won’t.”

 Samoylenko bGlinked and turned crimson; he mechanically drew towards him
      the book with the spider on it and looked at it, then he got up and took
      his hat.

 Von Koren felt sorry for him.

 “What it is to have to live and do with people like this,”
      said the zoologist, and he kicked a paper into the corner with
      indignation. “You must understand that this is not kindness, it is
      not love, but cowardice, slackness, poison! What’s gained by reason
      is lost by your flabby good-for-nothing hearts! When I was ill with
      typhoid as a schoolboy, my aunt in her sympathy gave me pickled mushrooms
      to eat, and I very nearly died. You, and my aunt too, must understand that
      love for man is not to be found in the heart or the stomach or the bowels,
      but here!”

 Von Koren slapped himself on the forehead.

 “Take it,” he said, and thrust a hundred-rouble note into his
      hand.

 “You’ve no need to be angry, Kolya,” said Samoylenko
      mildly, folding up the note. “I quite understand you, but . . . you
      must put yourself in my place.”

 “You are an old woman, that’s what you are.”

 The deacon burst out laughing.

 “Hear my last request, Alexandr Daviditch,” said Von Koren
      hotly. “When you give that scoundrel the money, make it a condition
      that he takes his lady with him, or sends her on ahead, and don’t
      give it him without. There’s no need to stand on ceremony with him.
      Tell him so, or, if you don’t, I give you my word I’ll go to
      his office and kick him downstairs, and I’ll break off all
      acquaintance with you. So you’d better know it.”

 “Well! To go with her or send her on beforehand will be more
      convenient for him,” said Samoylenko. “He’ll be
      delighted indeed. Well, goodbye.”

 He said good-bye affectionately and went out, but before shutting the door
      after him, he looked round at Von Koren and, with a ferocious face, said:

 “It’s the Germans who have ruined you, brother! Yes! The
      Germans!”

 XII

 Next day, Thursday, Marya Konstantinovna was celebrating the birthday of
      her Kostya. All were invited to come at midday and eat pies, and in the
      evening to drink chocolate. When Laevsky and Nadyezhda Fyodorovna arrived
      in the evening, the zoologist, who was already sitting in the
      drawing-room, drinking chocolate, asked Samoylenko:

 “Have you talked to him?”

 “Not yet.”

 “Mind now, don’t stand on ceremony. I can’t understand
      the insolence of these people! Why, they know perfectly well the view
      taken by this family of their cohabitation, and yet they force themselves
      in here.”

 “If one is to pay attention to every prejudice,” said
      Samoylenko, “one could go nowhere.”

 “Do you mean to say that the repugnance felt by the masses for
      illicit love and moral laxity is a prejudice?”

 “Of course it is. It’s prejudice and hate. When the soldiers
      see a girl of light behaviour, they laugh and whistle; but just ask them
      what they are themselves.”

 “It’s not for nothing they whistle. The fact that girls
      strangle their illegitimate children and go to prison for it, and that
      Anna Karenin flung herself under the train, and that in the villages they
      smear the gates with tar, and that you and I, without knowing why, are
      pleased by Katya’s purity, and that every one of us feels a vague
      craving for pure love, though he knows there is no such love—is all
      that prejudice? That is the one thing, brother, which has survived intact
      from natural selection, and, if it were not for that obscure force
      regulating the relations of the sexes, the Laevskys would have it all
      their own way, and mankind would degenerate in two years.”

 Laevsky came into the drawing-room, greeted every one, and shaking hands
      with Von Koren, smiled ingratiatingly. He waited for a favourable moment
      and said to Samoylenko:

 “Excuse me, Alexandr Daviditch, I must say two words to you.”

 Samoylenko got up, put his arm round Laevsky’s waist, and both of
      them went into Nikodim Alexandritch’s study.

 “To-morrow’s Friday,” said Laevsky, biting his nails.
      “Have you got what you promised?”

 “I’ve only got two hundred. I’ll get the rest to-day or
      to-morrow. Don’t worry yourself.”

 “Thank God . . .” sighed Laevsky, and his hands began
      trembling with joy. “You are saving me, Alexandr Daviditch, and I
      swear to you by God, by my happiness and anything you like, I’ll
      send you the money as soon as I arrive. And I’ll send you my old
      debt too.”

 “Look here, Vanya . . .” said Samoylenko, turning crimson and
      taking him by the button. “You must forgive my meddling in your
      private affairs, but . . . why shouldn’t you take Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna with you?”

 “You queer fellow. How is that possible? One of us must stay, or our
      creditors will raise an outcry. You see, I owe seven hundred or more to
      the shops. Only wait, and I will send them the money. I’ll stop
      their mouths, and then she can come away.”

 “I see. . . . But why shouldn’t you send her on first?”

 “My goodness, as though that were possible!” Laevsky was
      horrified. “Why, she’s a woman; what would she do there alone?
      What does she know about it? That would only be a loss of time and a
      useless waste of money.”

 “That’s reasonable . . .” thought Samoylenko, but
      remembering his conversation with Von Koren, he looked down and said
      sullenly: “I can’t agree with you. Either go with her or send
      her first; otherwise . . . otherwise I won’t give you the money.
      Those are my last words. . .”

 He staggered back, lurched backwards against the door, and went into the
      drawing-room, crimson, and overcome with confusion.

 “Friday . . . Friday,” thought Laevsky, going back into the
      drawing-room. “Friday. . . .”

 He was handed a cup of chocolate; he burnt his lips and tongue with the
      scalding chocolate and thought: “Friday . . . Friday. . . .”

 For some reason he could not get the word “Friday” out of his
      head; he could think of nothing but Friday, and the only thing that was
      clear to him, not in his brain but somewhere in his heart, was that he
      would not get off on Saturday. Before him stood Nikodim Alexandritch, very
      neat, with his hair combed over his temples, saying:

 “Please take something to eat. . . .”

 Marya Konstantinovna showed the visitors Katya’s school report and
      said, drawling:

 “It’s very, very difficult to do well at school nowadays! So
      much is expected . . .”

 “Mamma!” groaned Katya, not knowing where to hide her
      confusion at the praises of the company.

 Laevsky, too, looked at the report and praised it. Scripture, Russian
      language, conduct, fives and fours, danced before his eyes, and all this,
      mixed with the haunting refrain of “Friday,” with the
      carefully combed locks of Nikodim Alexandritch and the red cheeks of
      Katya, produced on him a sensation of such immense overwhelming boredom
      that he almost shrieked with despair and asked himself: “Is it
      possible, is it possible I shall not get away?”

 They put two card tables side by side and sat down to play post. Laevsky
      sat down too.

 “Friday . . . Friday . . .” he kept thinking, as he smiled and
      took a pencil out of his pocket. “Friday. . . .”

 He wanted to think over his position, and was afraid to think. It was
      terrible to him to realise that the doctor had detected him in the
      deception which he had so long and carefully concealed from himself. Every
      time he thought of his future he would not let his thoughts have full
      rein. He would get into the train and set off, and thereby the problem of
      his life would be solved, and he did not let his thoughts go farther. Like
      a far-away dim light in the fields, the thought sometimes flickered in his
      mind that in one of the side-streets of Petersburg, in the remote future,
      he would have to have recourse to a tiny lie in order to get rid of
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and pay his debts; he would tell a lie only once, and
      then a completely new life would begin. And that was right: at the price
      of a small lie he would win so much truth.

 Now when by his blunt refusal the doctor had crudely hinted at his
      deception, he began to understand that he would need deception not only in
      the remote future, but to-day, and to-morrow, and in a month’s time,
      and perhaps up to the very end of his life. In fact, in order to get away
      he would have to lie to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, to his creditors, and to his
      superiors in the Service; then, in order to get money in Petersburg, he
      would have to lie to his mother, to tell her that he had already broken
      with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna; and his mother would not give him more than
      five hundred roubles, so he had already deceived the doctor, as he would
      not be in a position to pay him back the money within a short time.
      Afterwards, when Nadyezhda Fyodorovna came to Petersburg, he would have to
      resort to a regular series of deceptions, little and big, in order to get
      free of her; and again there would be tears, boredom, a disgusting
      existence, remorse, and so there would be no new life. Deception and
      nothing more. A whole mountain of lies rose before Laevsky’s
      imagination. To leap over it at one bound and not to do his lying
      piecemeal, he would have to bring himself to stern, uncompromising action;
      for instance, to getting up without saying a word, putting on his hat, and
      at once setting off without money and without explanation. But Laevsky
      felt that was impossible for him.

 “Friday, Friday . . .” he thought. “Friday. . . .”

 They wrote little notes, folded them in two, and put them in Nikodim
      Alexandritch’s old top-hat. When there were a sufficient heap of
      notes, Kostya, who acted the part of postman, walked round the table and
      delivered them. The deacon, Katya, and Kostya, who received amusing notes
      and tried to write as funnily as they could, were highly delighted.

 “We must have a little talk,” Nadyezhda Fyodorovna read in a
      little note; she glanced at Marya Konstantinovna, who gave her an
      almond-oily smile and nodded.

 “Talk of what?” thought Nadyezhda Fyodorovna. “If one
      can’t tell the whole, it’s no use talking.”

 Before going out for the evening she had tied Laevsky’s cravat for
      him, and that simple action filled her soul with tenderness and sorrow.
      The anxiety in his face, his absent-minded looks, his pallor, and the
      incomprehensible change that had taken place in him of late, and the fact
      that she had a terrible revolting secret from him, and the fact that her
      hands trembled when she tied his cravat—all this seemed to tell her
      that they had not long left to be together. She looked at him as though he
      were an ikon, with terror and penitence, and thought: “Forgive,
      forgive.”

 Opposite her was sitting Atchmianov, and he never took his black,
      love-sick eyes off her. She was stirred by passion; she was ashamed of
      herself, and afraid that even her misery and sorrow would not prevent her
      from yielding to impure desire to-morrow, if not to-day —and that,
      like a drunkard, she would not have the strength to stop herself.

 She made up her mind to go away that she might not continue this life,
      shameful for herself, and humiliating for Laevsky. She would beseech him
      with tears to let her go; and if he opposed her, she would go away
      secretly. She would not tell him what had happened; let him keep a pure
      memory of her.

 “I love you, I love you, I love you,” she read. It was from
      Atchmianov.

 She would live in some far remote place, would work and send Laevsky,
      “anonymously,” money, embroidered shirts, and tobacco, and
      would return to him only in old age or if he were dangerously ill and
      needed a nurse. When in his old age he learned what were her reasons for
      leaving him and refusing to be his wife, he would appreciate her sacrifice
      and forgive.

 “You’ve got a long nose.” That must be from the deacon
      or Kostya.

 Nadyezhda Fyodorovna imagined how, parting from Laevsky, she would embrace
      him warmly, would kiss his hand, and would swear to love him all her life,
      all her life, and then, living in obscurity among strangers, she would
      every day think that somewhere she had a friend, some one she loved—a
      pure, noble, lofty man who kept a pure memory of her.

 “If you don’t give me an interview to-day, I shall take
      measures, I assure you on my word of honour. You can’t treat decent
      people like this; you must understand that.” That was from Kirilin.

 XIII

 Laevsky received two notes; he opened one and read: “Don’t go
      away, my darling.”

 “Who could have written that?” he thought. “Not
      Samoylenko, of course. And not the deacon, for he doesn’t know I
      want to go away. Von Koren, perhaps?”

 The zoologist bent over the table and drew a pyramid. Laevsky fancied that
      his eyes were smiling.

 “Most likely Samoylenko . . . has been gossiping,” thought
      Laevsky.

 In the other note, in the same disguised angular handwriting with long
      tails to the letters, was written: “Somebody won’t go away on
      Saturday.”

 “A stupid gibe,” thought Laevsky. “Friday, Friday. . . .”

 Something rose in his throat. He touched his collar and coughed, but
      instead of a cough a laugh broke from his throat.

 “Ha-ha-ha!” he laughed. “Ha-ha-ha! What am I laughing
      at? Ha-ha-ha!”

 He tried to restrain himself, covered his mouth with his hand, but the
      laugh choked his chest and throat, and his hand could not cover his mouth.

 “How stupid it is!” he thought, rolling with laughter. “Have
      I gone out of my mind?”

 The laugh grew shriller and shriller, and became something like the bark
      of a lap-dog. Laevsky tried to get up from the table, but his legs would
      not obey him and his right hand was strangely, without his volition,
      dancing on the table, convulsively clutching and crumpling up the bits of
      paper. He saw looks of wonder, Samoylenko’s grave, frightened face,
      and the eyes of the zoologist full of cold irony and disgust, and realised
      that he was in hysterics.

 “How hideous, how shameful!” he thought, feeling the warmth of
      tears on his face. “. . . Oh, oh, what a disgrace! It has never
      happened to me. . . .”

 They took him under his arms, and supporting his head from behind, led him
      away; a glass gleamed before his eyes and knocked against his teeth, and
      the water was spilt on his breast; he was in a little room, with two beds
      in the middle, side by side, covered by two snow-white quilts. He dropped
      on one of the beds and sobbed.

 “It’s nothing, it’s nothing,” Samoylenko kept
      saying; “it does happen . . . it does happen. . . .”

 Chill with horror, trembling all over and dreading something awful,
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna stood by the bedside and kept asking:

 “What is it? What is it? For God’s sake, tell me.”

 “Can Kirilin have written him something?” she thought.

 “It’s nothing,” said Laevsky, laughing and crying;
      “go away, darling.”

 His face expressed neither hatred nor repulsion: so he knew nothing;
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna was somewhat reassured, and she went into the
      drawing-room.

 “Don’t agitate yourself, my dear!” said Marya
      Konstantinovna, sitting down beside her and taking her hand. “It
      will pass. Men are just as weak as we poor sinners. You are both going
      through a crisis. . . . One can so well understand it! Well, my dear, I am
      waiting for an answer. Let us have a little talk.”

 “No, we are not going to talk,” said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna,
      listening to Laevsky’s sobs. “I feel depressed. . . . You must
      allow me to go home.”

 “What do you mean, what do you mean, my dear?” cried Marya
      Konstantinovna in alarm. “Do you think I could let you go without
      supper? We will have something to eat, and then you may go with my
      blessing.”

 “I feel miserable . . .” whispered Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, and
      she caught at the arm of the chair with both hands to avoid falling.

 “He’s got a touch of hysterics,” said Von Koren gaily,
      coming into the drawing-room, but seeing Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, he was
      taken aback and retreated.

 When the attack was over, Laevsky sat on the strange bed and thought.

 “Disgraceful! I’ve been howling like some wretched girl! I
      must have been absurd and disgusting. I will go away by the back stairs .
      . . . But that would seem as though I took my hysterics too seriously. I
      ought to take it as a joke. . . .”

 He looked in the looking-glass, sat there for some time, and went back
      into the drawing-room.

 “Here I am,” he said, smiling; he felt agonisingly ashamed,
      and he felt others were ashamed in his presence. “Fancy such a thing
      happening,” he said, sitting down. “I was sitting here, and
      all of a sudden, do you know, I felt a terrible piercing pain in my side .
      . . unendurable, my nerves could not stand it, and . . . and it led to
      this silly performance. This is the age of nerves; there is no help for
      it.”

 At supper he drank some wine, and, from time to time, with an abrupt sigh
      rubbed his side as though to suggest that he still felt the pain. And no
      one, except Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, believed him, and he saw that.

 After nine o’clock they went for a walk on the boulevard. Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna, afraid that Kirilin would speak to her, did her best to keep
      all the time beside Marya Konstantinovna and the children. She felt weak
      with fear and misery, and felt she was going to be feverish; she was
      exhausted and her legs would hardly move, but she did not go home, because
      she felt sure that she would be followed by Kirilin or Atchmianov or both
      at once. Kirilin walked behind her with Nikodim Alexandritch, and kept
      humming in an undertone:

 “I don’t al-low people to play with me! I don’t al-low
      it.”

 From the boulevard they went back to the pavilion and walked along the
      beach, and looked for a long time at the phosphorescence on the water. Von
      Koren began telling them why it looked phosphorescent.

 XIV

 “It’s time I went to my vint . . . . They will be
      waiting for me,” said Laevsky. “Good-bye, my friends.”

 “I’ll come with you; wait a minute,” said Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna, and she took his arm.

 They said good-bye to the company and went away. Kirilin took leave too,
      and saying that he was going the same way, went along beside them.

 “What will be, will be,” thought Nadyezhda Fyodorovna. “So
      be it. . . .”

 And it seemed to her that all the evil memories in her head had taken
      shape and were walking beside her in the darkness, breathing heavily,
      while she, like a fly that had fallen into the inkpot, was crawling
      painfully along the pavement and smirching Laevsky’s side and arm
      with blackness.

 If Kirilin should do anything horrid, she thought, not he but she would be
      to blame for it. There was a time when no man would have talked to her as
      Kirilin had done, and she had torn up her security like a thread and
      destroyed it irrevocably—who was to blame for it? Intoxicated by her
      passions she had smiled at a complete stranger, probably just because he
      was tall and a fine figure. After two meetings she was weary of him, had
      thrown him over, and did not that, she thought now, give him the right to
      treat her as he chose?

 “Here I’ll say good-bye to you, darling,” said Laevsky.
      “Ilya Mihalitch will see you home.”

 He nodded to Kirilin, and, quickly crossing the boulevard, walked along
      the street to Sheshkovsky’s, where there were lights in the windows,
      and then they heard the gate bang as he went in.

 “Allow me to have an explanation with you,” said Kirilin.
      “I’m not a boy, not some Atchkasov or Latchkasov, Zatchkasov.
      . . . I demand serious attention.”

 Nadyezhda Fyodorovna’s heart began beating violently. She made no
      reply.

 “The abrupt change in your behaviour to me I put down at first to
      coquetry,” Kirilin went on; “now I see that you don’t
      know how to behave with gentlemanly people. You simply wanted to play with
      me, as you are playing with that wretched Armenian boy; but I’m a
      gentleman and I insist on being treated like a gentleman. And so I am at
      your service. . . .”

 “I’m miserable,” said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna beginning to
      cry, and to hide her tears she turned away.

 “I’m miserable too,” said Kirilin, “but what of
      that?”

 Kirilin was silent for a space, then he said distinctly and emphatically:

 “I repeat, madam, that if you do not give me an interview this
      evening, I’ll make a scandal this very evening.”

 “Let me off this evening,” said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, and she
      did not recognise her own voice, it was so weak and pitiful.

 “I must give you a lesson. . . . Excuse me for the roughness of my
      tone, but it’s necessary to give you a lesson. Yes, I regret to say
      I must give you a lesson. I insist on two interviews—to-day and
      to-morrow. After to-morrow you are perfectly free and can go wherever you
      like with any one you choose. To-day and to-morrow.”

 Nadyezhda Fyodorovna went up to her gate and stopped.

 “Let me go,” she murmured, trembling all over and seeing
      nothing before her in the darkness but his white tunic. “You’re
      right: I’m a horrible woman. . . . I’m to blame, but let me go
      . . . I beg you.” She touched his cold hand and shuddered. “I
      beseech you. . . .”

 “Alas!” sighed Kirilin, “alas! it’s not part of my
      plan to let you go; I only mean to give you a lesson and make you realise.
      And what’s more, madam, I’ve too little faith in women.”

 “I’m miserable. . . .”

 Nadyezhda Fyodorovna listened to the even splash of the sea, looked at the
      sky studded with stars, and longed to make haste and end it all, and get
      away from the cursed sensation of life, with its sea, stars, men, fever.

 “Only not in my home,” she said coldly. “Take me
      somewhere else.”

 “Come to Muridov’s. That’s better.”

 “Where’s that?”

 “Near the old wall.”

 She walked quickly along the street and then turned into the side-street
      that led towards the mountains. It was dark. There were pale streaks of
      light here and there on the pavement, from the lighted windows, and it
      seemed to her that, like a fly, she kept falling into the ink and crawling
      out into the light again. At one point he stumbled, almost fell down and
      burst out laughing.

 “He’s drunk,” thought Nadyezhda Fyodorovna. “Never
      mind. . . . Never mind. . . . So be it.”

 Atchmianov, too, soon took leave of the party and followed Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna to ask her to go for a row. He went to her house and looked
      over the fence: the windows were wide open, there were no lights.

 “Nadyezhda Fyodorovna!” he called.

 A moment passed, he called again.

 “Who’s there?” he heard Olga’s voice.

 “Is Nadyezhda Fyodorovna at home?”

 “No, she has not come in yet.”

 “Strange . . . very strange,” thought Atchmianov, feeling very
      uneasy. “She went home. . . .”

 He walked along the boulevard, then along the street, and glanced in at
      the windows of Sheshkovsky’s. Laevsky was sitting at the table
      without his coat on, looking attentively at his cards.

 “Strange, strange,” muttered Atchmianov, and remembering
      Laevsky’s hysterics, he felt ashamed. “If she is not at home,
      where is she?”

 He went to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna’s lodgings again, and looked at the
      dark windows.

 “It’s a cheat, a cheat . . .” he thought, remembering
      that, meeting him at midday at Marya Konstantinovna’s, she had
      promised to go in a boat with him that evening.

 The windows of the house where Kirilin lived were dark, and there was a
      policeman sitting asleep on a little bench at the gate. Everything was
      clear to Atchmianov when he looked at the windows and the policeman. He
      made up his mind to go home, and set off in that direction, but somehow
      found himself near Nadyezhda Fyodorovna’s lodgings again. He sat
      down on the bench near the gate and took off his hat, feeling that his
      head was burning with jealousy and resentment.

 The clock in the town church only struck twice in the twenty-four hours—at
      midday and midnight. Soon after it struck midnight he heard hurried
      footsteps.

 “To-morrow evening, then, again at Muridov’s,”
      Atchmianov heard, and he recognised Kirilin’s voice. “At eight
      o’clock; good-bye!”

 Nadyezhda Fyodorovna made her appearance near the garden. Without noticing
      that Atchmianov was sitting on the bench, she passed beside him like a
      shadow, opened the gate, and leaving it open, went into the house. In her
      own room she lighted the candle and quickly undressed, but instead of
      getting into bed, she sank on her knees before a chair, flung her arms
      round it, and rested her head on it.

 It was past two when Laevsky came home.

 XV

 Having made up his mind to lie, not all at once but piecemeal, Laevsky
      went soon after one o’clock next day to Samoylenko to ask for the
      money that he might be sure to get off on Saturday. After his hysterical
      attack, which had added an acute feeling of shame to his depressed state
      of mind, it was unthinkable to remain in the town. If Samoylenko should
      insist on his conditions, he thought it would be possible to agree to them
      and take the money, and next day, just as he was starting, to say that
      Nadyezhda Fyodorovna refused to go. He would be able to persuade her that
      evening that the whole arrangement would be for her benefit. If
      Samoylenko, who was obviously under the influence of Von Koren, should
      refuse the money altogether or make fresh conditions, then he, Laevsky,
      would go off that very evening in a cargo vessel, or even in a
      sailing-boat, to Novy Athon or Novorossiisk, would send from there an
      humiliating telegram, and would stay there till his mother sent him the
      money for the journey.

 When he went into Samoylenko’s, he found Von Koren in the
      drawing-room. The zoologist had just arrived for dinner, and, as usual,
      was turning over the album and scrutinising the gentlemen in top-hats and
      the ladies in caps.

 “How very unlucky!” thought Laevsky, seeing him. “He may
      be in the way. Good-morning.”

 “Good-morning,” answered Von Koren, without looking at him.

 “Is Alexandr Daviditch at home?”

 “Yes, in the kitchen.”

 Laevsky went into the kitchen, but seeing from the door that Samoylenko
      was busy over the salad, he went back into the drawing-room and sat down.
      He always had a feeling of awkwardness in the zoologist’s presence,
      and now he was afraid there would be talk about his attack of hysterics.
      There was more than a minute of silence. Von Koren suddenly raised his
      eyes to Laevsky and asked:

 “How do you feel after yesterday?”

 “Very well indeed,” said Laevsky, flushing. “It really
      was nothing much. . . .”

 “Until yesterday I thought it was only ladies who had hysterics, and
      so at first I thought you had St. Vitus’s dance.”

 Laevsky smiled ingratiatingly, and thought:

 “How indelicate on his part! He knows quite well how unpleasant it
      is for me. . . .”

 “Yes, it was a ridiculous performance,” he said, still
      smiling. “I’ve been laughing over it the whole morning. What’s
      so curious in an attack of hysterics is that you know it is absurd, and
      are laughing at it in your heart, and at the same time you sob. In our
      neurotic age we are the slaves of our nerves; they are our masters and do
      as they like with us. Civilisation has done us a bad turn in that way. . .
      .”

 As Laevsky talked, he felt it disagreeable that Von Koren listened to him
      gravely, and looked at him steadily and attentively as though studying
      him; and he was vexed with himself that in spite of his dislike of Von
      Koren, he could not banish the ingratiating smile from his face.

 “I must admit, though,” he added, “that there were
      immediate causes for the attack, and quite sufficient ones too. My health
      has been terribly shaky of late. To which one must add boredom, constantly
      being hard up . . . the absence of people and general interests . . . . My
      position is worse than a governor’s.”

 “Yes, your position is a hopeless one,” answered Von Koren.

 These calm, cold words, implying something between a jeer and an uninvited
      prediction, offended Laevsky. He recalled the zoologist’s eyes the
      evening before, full of mockery and disgust. He was silent for a space and
      then asked, no longer smiling:

 “How do you know anything of my position?”

 “You were only just speaking of it yourself. Besides, your friends
      take such a warm interest in you, that I am hearing about you all day
      long.”

 “What friends? Samoylenko, I suppose?”

 “Yes, he too.”

 “I would ask Alexandr Daviditch and my friends in general not to
      trouble so much about me.”

 “Here is Samoylenko; you had better ask him not to trouble so much
      about you.”

 “I don’t understand your tone,” Laevsky muttered,
      suddenly feeling as though he had only just realised that the zoologist
      hated and despised him, and was jeering at him, and was his bitterest and
      most inveterate enemy.

 “Keep that tone for some one else,” he said softly, unable to
      speak aloud for the hatred with which his chest and throat were choking,
      as they had been the night before with laughter.

 Samoylenko came in in his shirt-sleeves, crimson and perspiring from the
      stifling kitchen.

 “Ah, you here?” he said. “Good-morning, my dear boy.
      Have you had dinner? Don’t stand on ceremony. Have you had dinner?”

 “Alexandr Daviditch,” said Laevsky, standing up, “though
      I did appeal to you to help me in a private matter, it did not follow that
      I released you from the obligation of discretion and respect for other
      people’s private affairs.”

 “What’s this?” asked Samoylenko, in astonishment.

 “If you have no money,” Laevsky went on, raising his voice and
      shifting from one foot to the other in his excitement, “don’t
      give it; refuse it. But why spread abroad in every back street that my
      position is hopeless, and all the rest of it? I can’t endure such
      benevolence and friend’s assistance where there’s a
      shilling-worth of talk for a ha’p’orth of help! You can boast
      of your benevolence as much as you please, but no one has given you the
      right to gossip about my private affairs!”

 “What private affairs?” asked Samoylenko, puzzled and
      beginning to be angry. “If you’ve come here to be abusive, you
      had better clear out. You can come again afterwards!”

 He remembered the rule that when one is angry with one’s neighbour,
      one must begin to count a hundred, and one will grow calm again; and he
      began rapidly counting.

 “I beg you not to trouble yourself about me,” Laevsky went on.
      “Don’t pay any attention to me, and whose business is it what
      I do and how I live? Yes, I want to go away. Yes, I get into debt, I
      drink, I am living with another man’s wife, I’m hysterical, I’m
      ordinary. I am not so profound as some people, but whose business is that?
      Respect other people’s privacy.”

 “Excuse me, brother,” said Samoylenko, who had counted up to
      thirty-five, “but . . .”

 “Respect other people’s individuality!” interrupted
      Laevsky. “This continual gossip about other people’s affairs,
      this sighing and groaning and everlasting prying, this eavesdropping, this
      friendly sympathy . . . damn it all! They lend me money and make
      conditions as though I were a schoolboy! I am treated as the devil knows
      what! I don’t want anything,” shouted Laevsky, staggering with
      excitement and afraid that it might end in another attack of hysterics.
      “I shan’t get away on Saturday, then,” flashed through
      his mind. “I want nothing. All I ask of you is to spare me your
      protecting care. I’m not a boy, and I’m not mad, and I beg you
      to leave off looking after me.”

 The deacon came in, and seeing Laevsky pale and gesticulating, addressing
      his strange speech to the portrait of Prince Vorontsov, stood still by the
      door as though petrified.

 “This continual prying into my soul,” Laevsky went on, “is
      insulting to my human dignity, and I beg these volunteer detectives to
      give up their spying! Enough!”

 “What’s that . . . what did you say?” said Samoylenko,
      who had counted up to a hundred. He turned crimson and went up to Laevsky.

 “It’s enough,” said Laevsky, breathing hard and
      snatching up his cap.

 “I’m a Russian doctor, a nobleman by birth, and a civil
      councillor,” said Samoylenko emphatically. “I’ve never
      been a spy, and I allow no one to insult me!” he shouted in a
      breaking voice, emphasising the last word. “Hold your tongue!”

 The deacon, who had never seen the doctor so majestic, so swelling with
      dignity, so crimson and so ferocious, shut his mouth, ran out into the
      entry and there exploded with laughter.

 As though through a fog, Laevsky saw Von Koren get up and, putting his
      hands in his trouser-pockets, stand still in an attitude of expectancy, as
      though waiting to see what would happen. This calm attitude struck Laevsky
      as insolent and insulting to the last degree.

 “Kindly take back your words,” shouted Samoylenko.

 Laevsky, who did not by now remember what his words were, answered:

 “Leave me alone! I ask for nothing. All I ask is that you and German
      upstarts of Jewish origin should let me alone! Or I shall take steps to
      make you! I will fight you!”

 “Now we understand,” said Von Koren, coming from behind the
      table. “Mr. Laevsky wants to amuse himself with a duel before he
      goes away. I can give him that pleasure. Mr. Laevsky, I accept your
      challenge.”

 “A challenge,” said Laevsky, in a low voice, going up to the
      zoologist and looking with hatred at his swarthy brow and curly hair.
      “A challenge? By all means! I hate you! I hate you!”

 “Delighted. To-morrow morning early near Kerbalay’s. I leave
      all details to your taste. And now, clear out!”

 “I hate you,” Laevsky said softly, breathing hard. “I
      have hated you a long while! A duel! Yes!”

 “Get rid of him, Alexandr Daviditch, or else I’m going,”
      said Von Koren. “He’ll bite me.”

 Von Koren’s cool tone calmed the doctor; he seemed suddenly to come
      to himself, to recover his reason; he put both arms round Laevsky’s
      waist, and, leading him away from the zoologist, muttered in a friendly
      voice that shook with emotion:

 “My friends . . . dear, good . . . you’ve lost your tempers
      and that’s enough . . . and that’s enough, my friends.”

 Hearing his soft, friendly voice, Laevsky felt that something unheard of,
      monstrous, had just happened to him, as though he had been nearly run over
      by a train; he almost burst into tears, waved his hand, and ran out of the
      room.

 “To feel that one is hated, to expose oneself before the man who
      hates one, in the most pitiful, contemptible, helpless state. My God, how
      hard it is!” he thought a little while afterwards as he sat in the
      pavilion, feeling as though his body were scarred by the hatred of which
      he had just been the object.

 “How coarse it is, my God!”

 Cold water with brandy in it revived him. He vividly pictured Von Koren’s
      calm, haughty face; his eyes the day before, his shirt like a rug, his
      voice, his white hand; and heavy, passionate, hungry hatred rankled in his
      breast and clamoured for satisfaction. In his thoughts he felled Von Koren
      to the ground, and trampled him underfoot. He remembered to the minutest
      detail all that had happened, and wondered how he could have smiled
      ingratiatingly to that insignificant man, and how he could care for the
      opinion of wretched petty people whom nobody knew, living in a miserable
      little town which was not, it seemed, even on the map, and of which not
      one decent person in Petersburg had heard. If this wretched little town
      suddenly fell into ruins or caught fire, the telegram with the news would
      be read in Russia with no more interest than an advertisement of the sale
      of second-hand furniture. Whether he killed Von Koren next day or left him
      alive, it would be just the same, equally useless and uninteresting.
      Better to shoot him in the leg or hand, wound him, then laugh at him, and
      let him, like an insect with a broken leg lost in the grass—let him
      be lost with his obscure sufferings in the crowd of insignificant people
      like himself.

 Laevsky went to Sheshkovsky, told him all about it, and asked him to be
      his second; then they both went to the superintendent of the postal
      telegraph department, and asked him, too, to be a second, and stayed to
      dinner with him. At dinner there was a great deal of joking and laughing.
      Laevsky made jests at his own expense, saying he hardly knew how to fire
      off a pistol, calling himself a royal archer and William Tell.

 “We must give this gentleman a lesson . . .” he said.

 After dinner they sat down to cards. Laevsky played, drank wine, and
      thought that duelling was stupid and senseless, as it did not decide the
      question but only complicated it, but that it was sometimes impossible to
      get on without it. In the given case, for instance, one could not, of
      course, bring an action against Von Koren. And this duel was so far good
      in that it made it impossible for Laevsky to remain in the town
      afterwards. He got a little drunk and interested in the game, and felt at
      ease.

 But when the sun had set and it grew dark, he was possessed by a feeling
      of uneasiness. It was not fear at the thought of death, because while he
      was dining and playing cards, he had for some reason a confident belief
      that the duel would end in nothing; it was dread at the thought of
      something unknown which was to happen next morning for the first time in
      his life, and dread of the coming night. . . . He knew that the night
      would be long and sleepless, and that he would have to think not only of
      Von Koren and his hatred, but also of the mountain of lies which he had to
      get through, and which he had not strength or ability to dispense with. It
      was as though he had been taken suddenly ill; all at once he lost all
      interest in the cards and in people, grew restless, and began asking them
      to let him go home. He was eager to get into bed, to lie without moving,
      and to prepare his thoughts for the night. Sheshkovsky and the postal
      superintendent saw him home and went on to Von Koren’s to arrange
      about the duel.

 Near his lodgings Laevsky met Atchmianov. The young man was breathless and
      excited.

 “I am looking for you, Ivan Andreitch,” he said. “I beg
      you to come quickly. . . .”

 “Where?”

 “Some one wants to see you, some one you don’t know, about
      very important business; he earnestly begs you to come for a minute. He
      wants to speak to you of something. . . . For him it’s a question of
      life and death. . . .” In his excitement Atchmianov spoke in a
      strong Armenian accent.

 “Who is it?” asked Laevsky.

 “He asked me not to tell you his name.”

 “Tell him I’m busy; to-morrow, if he likes. . . .”

 “How can you!” Atchmianov was aghast. “He wants to tell
      you something very important for you . . . very important! If you don’t
      come, something dreadful will happen.”

 “Strange . . .” muttered Laevsky, unable to understand why
      Atchmianov was so excited and what mysteries there could be in this dull,
      useless little town.

 “Strange,” he repeated in hesitation. “Come along,
      though; I don’t care.”

 Atchmianov walked rapidly on ahead and Laevsky followed him. They walked
      down a street, then turned into an alley.

 “What a bore this is!” said Laevsky.

 “One minute, one minute . . . it’s near.”

 Near the old rampart they went down a narrow alley between two empty
      enclosures, then they came into a sort of large yard and went towards a
      small house.

 “That’s Muridov’s, isn’t it?” asked Laevsky.

 “Yes.”

 “But why we’ve come by the back yards I don’t
      understand. We might have come by the street; it’s nearer. . . .”

 “Never mind, never mind. . . .”

 It struck Laevsky as strange, too, that Atchmianov led him to a back
      entrance, and motioned to him as though bidding him go quietly and hold
      his tongue.

 “This way, this way . . .” said Atchmianov, cautiously opening
      the door and going into the passage on tiptoe. “Quietly, quietly, I
      beg you . . . they may hear.”

 He listened, drew a deep breath and said in a whisper:

 “Open that door, and go in . . . don’t be afraid.”

 Laevsky, puzzled, opened the door and went into a room with a low ceiling
      and curtained windows.

 There was a candle on the table.

 “What do you want?” asked some one in the next room. “Is
      it you, Muridov?”

 Laevsky turned into that room and saw Kirilin, and beside him Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna.

 He didn’t hear what was said to him; he staggered back, and did not
      know how he found himself in the street. His hatred for Von Koren and his
      uneasiness—all had vanished from his soul. As he went home he waved
      his right arm awkwardly and looked carefully at the ground under his feet,
      trying to step where it was smooth. At home in his study he walked
      backwards and forwards, rubbing his hands, and awkwardly shrugging his
      shoulders and neck, as though his jacket and shirt were too tight; then he
      lighted a candle and sat down to the table. . . .

 XVI

 “The ‘humane studies’ of which you speak will only
      satisfy human thought when, as they advance, they meet the exact sciences
      and progress side by side with them. Whether they will meet under a new
      microscope, or in the monologues of a new Hamlet, or in a new religion, I
      do not know, but I expect the earth will be covered with a crust of ice
      before it comes to pass. Of all humane learning the most durable and
      living is, of course, the teaching of Christ; but look how differently
      even that is interpreted! Some teach that we must love all our neighbours
      but make an exception of soldiers, criminals, and lunatics. They allow the
      first to be killed in war, the second to be isolated or executed, and the
      third they forbid to marry. Other interpreters teach that we must love all
      our neighbours without exception, with no distinction of plus or minus .
      According to their teaching, if a consumptive or a murderer or an
      epileptic asks your daughter in marriage, you must let him have her. If crêtins go to war against the physically and mentally healthy, don’t defend
      yourselves. This advocacy of love for love’s sake, like art for art’s
      sake, if it could have power, would bring mankind in the long run to
      complete extinction, and so would become the vastest crime that has ever
      been committed upon earth. There are very many interpretations, and since
      there are many of them, serious thought is not satisfied by any one of
      them, and hastens to add its own individual interpretation to the mass.
      For that reason you should never put a question on a philosophical or
      so-called Christian basis; by so doing you only remove the question
      further from solution.”

 The deacon listened to the zoologist attentively, thought a little, and
      asked:

 “Have the philosophers invented the moral law which is innate in
      every man, or did God create it together with the body?”

 “I don’t know. But that law is so universal among all peoples
      and all ages that I fancy we ought to recognise it as organically
      connected with man. It is not invented, but exists and will exist. I don’t
      tell you that one day it will be seen under the microscope, but its
      organic connection is shown, indeed, by evidence: serious affections of
      the brain and all so-called mental diseases, to the best of my belief,
      show themselves first of all in the perversion of the moral law.”

 “Good. So then, just as our stomach bids us eat, our moral sense
      bids us love our neighbours. Is that it? But our natural man through
      self-love opposes the voice of conscience and reason, and this gives rise
      to many brain-racking questions. To whom ought we to turn for the solution
      of those questions if you forbid us to put them on the philosophic basis?”

 “Turn to what little exact science we have. Trust to evidence and
      the logic of facts. It is true it is but little, but, on the other hand,
      it is less fluid and shifting than philosophy. The moral law, let us
      suppose, demands that you love your neighbour. Well? Love ought to show
      itself in the removal of everything which in one way or another is
      injurious to men and threatens them with danger in the present or in the
      future. Our knowledge and the evidence tells us that the morally and
      physically abnormal are a menace to humanity. If so you must struggle
      against the abnormal; if you are not able to raise them to the normal
      standard you must have strength and ability to render them harmless—that
      is, to destroy them.”

 “So love consists in the strong overcoming the weak.”

 “Undoubtedly.”

 “But you know the strong crucified our Lord Jesus Christ,”
      said the deacon hotly.

 “The fact is that those who crucified Him were not the strong but
      the weak. Human culture weakens and strives to nullify the struggle for
      existence and natural selection; hence the rapid advancement of the weak
      and their predominance over the strong. Imagine that you succeeded in
      instilling into bees humanitarian ideas in their crude and elementary
      form. What would come of it? The drones who ought to be killed would
      remain alive, would devour the honey, would corrupt and stifle the bees,
      resulting in the predominance of the weak over the strong and the
      degeneration of the latter. The same process is taking place now with
      humanity; the weak are oppressing the strong. Among savages untouched by
      civilisation the strongest, cleverest, and most moral takes the lead; he
      is the chief and the master. But we civilised men have crucified Christ,
      and we go on crucifying Him, so there is something lacking in us. . . .
      And that something one ought to raise up in ourselves, or there will be no
      end to these errors.”

 “But what criterion have you to distinguish the strong from the
      weak?”

 “Knowledge and evidence. The tuberculous and the scrofulous are
      recognised by their diseases, and the insane and the immoral by their
      actions.”

 “But mistakes may be made!”

 “Yes, but it’s no use to be afraid of getting your feet wet
      when you are threatened with the deluge!”

 “That’s philosophy,” laughed the deacon.

 “Not a bit of it. You are so corrupted by your seminary philosophy
      that you want to see nothing but fog in everything. The abstract studies
      with which your youthful head is stuffed are called abstract just because
      they abstract your minds from what is obvious. Look the devil straight in
      the eye, and if he’s the devil, tell him he’s the devil, and
      don’t go calling to Kant or Hegel for explanations.”

 The zoologist paused and went on:

 “Twice two’s four, and a stone’s a stone. Here to-morrow
      we have a duel. You and I will say it’s stupid and absurd, that the
      duel is out of date, that there is no real difference between the
      aristocratic duel and the drunken brawl in the pot-house, and yet we shall
      not stop, we shall go there and fight. So there is some force stronger
      than our reasoning. We shout that war is plunder, robbery, atrocity,
      fratricide; we cannot look upon blood without fainting; but the French or
      the Germans have only to insult us for us to feel at once an exaltation of
      spirit; in the most genuine way we shout ‘Hurrah!’ and rush to
      attack the foe. You will invoke the blessing of God on our weapons, and
      our valour will arouse universal and general enthusiasm. Again it follows
      that there is a force, if not higher, at any rate stronger, than us and
      our philosophy. We can no more stop it than that cloud which is moving
      upwards over the sea. Don’t be hypocritical, don’t make a long
      nose at it on the sly; and don’t say, ‘Ah, old-fashioned,
      stupid! Ah, it’s inconsistent with Scripture!’ but look it
      straight in the face, recognise its rational lawfulness, and when, for
      instance, it wants to destroy a rotten, scrofulous, corrupt race, don’t
      hinder it with your pilules and misunderstood quotations from the Gospel.
      Leskov has a story of a conscientious Danila who found a leper outside the
      town, and fed and warmed him in the name of love and of Christ. If that
      Danila had really loved humanity, he would have dragged the leper as far
      as possible from the town, and would have flung him in a pit, and would
      have gone to save the healthy. Christ, I hope, taught us a rational,
      intelligent, practical love.”

 “What a fellow you are!” laughed the deacon. “You don’t
      believe in Christ. Why do you mention His name so often?”

 “Yes, I do believe in Him. Only, of course, in my own way, not in
      yours. Oh, deacon, deacon!” laughed the zoologist; he put his arm
      round the deacon’s waist, and said gaily: “Well? Are you
      coming with us to the duel to-morrow?”

 “My orders don’t allow it, or else I should come.”

 “What do you mean by ‘orders’?”

 “I have been consecrated. I am in a state of grace.”

 “Oh, deacon, deacon,” repeated Von Koren, laughing, “I
      love talking to you.”

 “You say you have faith,” said the deacon. “What sort of
      faith is it? Why, I have an uncle, a priest, and he believes so that when
      in time of drought he goes out into the fields to pray for rain, he takes
      his umbrella and leather overcoat for fear of getting wet through on his
      way home. That’s faith! When he speaks of Christ, his face is full
      of radiance, and all the peasants, men and women, weep floods of tears. He
      would stop that cloud and put all those forces you talk about to flight.
      Yes . . . faith moves mountains.”

 The deacon laughed and slapped the zoologist on the shoulder.

 “Yes . . .” he went on; “here you are teaching all the
      time, fathoming the depths of the ocean, dividing the weak and the strong,
      writing books and challenging to duels—and everything remains as it
      is; but, behold! some feeble old man will mutter just one word with a holy
      spirit, or a new Mahomet, with a sword, will gallop from Arabia, and
      everything will be topsy-turvy, and in Europe not one stone will be left
      standing upon another.”

 “Well, deacon, that’s on the knees of the gods.”

 “Faith without works is dead, but works without faith are worse
      still—mere waste of time and nothing more.”

 The doctor came into sight on the sea-front. He saw the deacon and the
      zoologist, and went up to them.

 “I believe everything is ready,” he said, breathing hard.
      “Govorovsky and Boyko will be the seconds. They will start at five o’clock
      in the morning. How it has clouded over,” he said, looking at the
      sky. “One can see nothing; there will be rain directly.”

 “I hope you are coming with us?” said the zoologist.

 “No, God preserve me; I’m worried enough as it is. Ustimovitch
      is going instead of me. I’ve spoken to him already.”

 Far over the sea was a flash of lightning, followed by a hollow roll of
      thunder.

 “How stifling it is before a storm!” said Von Koren. “I
      bet you’ve been to Laevsky already and have been weeping on his
      bosom.”

 “Why should I go to him?” answered the doctor in confusion.
      “What next?”

 Before sunset he had walked several times along the boulevard and the
      street in the hope of meeting Laevsky. He was ashamed of his hastiness and
      the sudden outburst of friendliness which had followed it. He wanted to
      apologise to Laevsky in a joking tone, to give him a good talking to, to
      soothe him and to tell him that the duel was a survival of mediæval
      barbarism, but that Providence itself had brought them to the duel as a
      means of reconciliation; that the next day, both being splendid and highly
      intelligent people, they would, after exchanging shots, appreciate each
      other’s noble qualities and would become friends. But he could not
      come across Laevsky.

 “What should I go and see him for?” repeated Samoylenko.
      “I did not insult him; he insulted me. Tell me, please, why he
      attacked me. What harm had I done him? I go into the drawing-room, and,
      all of a sudden, without the least provocation: ‘Spy!’ There’s
      a nice thing! Tell me, how did it begin? What did you say to him?”

 “I told him his position was hopeless. And I was right. It is only
      honest men or scoundrels who can find an escape from any position, but one
      who wants to be at the same time an honest man and a scoundrel —it
      is a hopeless position. But it’s eleven o’clock, gentlemen,
      and we have to be up early to-morrow.”

 There was a sudden gust of wind; it blew up the dust on the sea-front,
      whirled it round in eddies, with a howl that drowned the roar of the sea.

 “A squall,” said the deacon. “We must go in, our eyes
      are getting full of dust.”

 As they went, Samoylenko sighed and, holding his hat, said:

 “I suppose I shan’t sleep to-night.”

 “Don’t you agitate yourself,” laughed the zoologist.
      “You can set your mind at rest; the duel will end in nothing.
      Laevsky will magnanimously fire into the air—he can do nothing else;
      and I daresay I shall not fire at all. To be arrested and lose my time on
      Laevsky’s account—the game’s not worth the candle. By
      the way, what is the punishment for duelling?”

 “Arrest, and in the case of the death of your opponent a maximum of
      three years’ imprisonment in the fortress.”

 “The fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul?”

 “No, in a military fortress, I believe.”

 “Though this fine gentleman ought to have a lesson!”

 Behind them on the sea, there was a flash of lightning, which for an
      instant lighted up the roofs of the houses and the mountains. The friends
      parted near the boulevard. When the doctor disappeared in the darkness and
      his steps had died away, Von Koren shouted to him:

 “I only hope the weather won’t interfere with us to-morrow!”

 “Very likely it will! Please God it may!”

 “Good-night!”

 “What about the night? What do you say?”

 In the roar of the wind and the sea and the crashes of thunder, it was
      difficult to hear.

 “It’s nothing,” shouted the zoologist, and hurried home.

 XVII

 “Upon my mind, weighed down with woe,
              Crowd thoughts, a heavy multitude:
              In silence memory unfolds
              Her long, long scroll before my eyes.
              Loathing and shuddering I curse
              And bitterly lament in vain,
              And bitter though the tears I weep
              I do not wash those lines away.”

                                      PUSHKIN.

 Whether they killed him next morning, or mocked at him—that is, left
      him his life—he was ruined, anyway. Whether this disgraced woman
      killed herself in her shame and despair, or dragged on her pitiful
      existence, she was ruined anyway.

 So thought Laevsky as he sat at the table late in the evening, still
      rubbing his hands. The windows suddenly blew open with a bang; a violent
      gust of wind burst into the room, and the papers fluttered from the table.
      Laevsky closed the windows and bent down to pick up the papers. He was
      aware of something new in his body, a sort of awkwardness he had not felt
      before, and his movements were strange to him. He moved timidly, jerking
      with his elbows and shrugging his shoulders; and when he sat down to the
      table again, he again began rubbing his hands. His body had lost its
      suppleness.

 On the eve of death one ought to write to one’s nearest relation.
      Laevsky thought of this. He took a pen and wrote with a tremulous hand:

 “Mother!”

 He wanted to write to beg his mother, for the sake of the merciful God in
      whom she believed, that she would give shelter and bring a little warmth
      and kindness into the life of the unhappy woman who, by his doing, had
      been disgraced and was in solitude, poverty, and weakness, that she would
      forgive and forget everything, everything, everything, and by her
      sacrifice atone to some extent for her son’s terrible sin. But he
      remembered how his mother, a stout, heavily-built old woman in a lace cap,
      used to go out into the garden in the morning, followed by her companion
      with the lap-dog; how she used to shout in a peremptory way to the
      gardener and the servants, and how proud and haughty her face was—he
      remembered all this and scratched out the word he had written.

 There was a vivid flash of lightning at all three windows, and it was
      followed by a prolonged, deafening roll of thunder, beginning with a
      hollow rumble and ending with a crash so violent that all the window-panes
      rattled. Laevsky got up, went to the window, and pressed his forehead
      against the pane. There was a fierce, magnificent storm. On the horizon
      lightning-flashes were flung in white streams from the storm-clouds into
      the sea, lighting up the high, dark waves over the far-away expanse. And
      to right and to left, and, no doubt, over the house too, the lightning
      flashed.

 “The storm!” whispered Laevsky; he had a longing to pray to
      some one or to something, if only to the lightning or the storm-clouds.
      “Dear storm!”

 He remembered how as a boy he used to run out into the garden without a
      hat on when there was a storm, and how two fair-haired girls with blue
      eyes used to run after him, and how they got wet through with the rain;
      they laughed with delight, but when there was a loud peal of thunder, the
      girls used to nestle up to the boy confidingly, while he crossed himself
      and made haste to repeat: “Holy, holy, holy. . . .” Oh, where
      had they vanished to! In what sea were they drowned, those dawning days of
      pure, fair life? He had no fear of the storm, no love of nature now; he
      had no God. All the confiding girls he had ever known had by now been
      ruined by him and those like him. All his life he had not planted one tree
      in his own garden, nor grown one blade of grass; and living among the
      living, he had not saved one fly; he had done nothing but destroy and
      ruin, and lie, lie. . . .

 “What in my past was not vice?” he asked himself, trying to
      clutch at some bright memory as a man falling down a precipice clutches at
      the bushes.

 School? The university? But that was a sham. He had neglected his work and
      forgotten what he had learnt. The service of his country? That, too, was a
      sham, for he did nothing in the Service, took a salary for doing nothing,
      and it was an abominable swindling of the State for which one was not
      punished.

 He had no craving for truth, and had not sought it; spellbound by vice and
      lying, his conscience had slept or been silent. Like a stranger, like an
      alien from another planet, he had taken no part in the common life of men,
      had been indifferent to their sufferings, their ideas, their religion,
      their sciences, their strivings, and their struggles. He had not said one
      good word, not written one line that was not useless and vulgar; he had
      not done his fellows one ha’p’orth of service, but had eaten
      their bread, drunk their wine, seduced their wives, lived on their
      thoughts, and to justify his contemptible, parasitic life in their eyes
      and in his own, he had always tried to assume an air of being higher and
      better than they. Lies, lies, lies. . . .

 He vividly remembered what he had seen that evening at Muridov’s,
      and he was in an insufferable anguish of loathing and misery. Kirilin and
      Atchmianov were loathsome, but they were only continuing what he had
      begun; they were his accomplices and his disciples. This young weak woman
      had trusted him more than a brother, and he had deprived her of her
      husband, of her friends and of her country, and had brought her here—to
      the heat, to fever, and to boredom; and from day to day she was bound to
      reflect, like a mirror, his idleness, his viciousness and falsity—and
      that was all she had had to fill her weak, listless, pitiable life. Then
      he had grown sick of her, had begun to hate her, but had not had the pluck
      to abandon her, and he had tried to entangle her more and more closely in
      a web of lies. . . . These men had done the rest.

 Laevsky sat at the table, then got up and went to the window; at one
      minute he put out the candle and then he lighted it again. He cursed
      himself aloud, wept and wailed, and asked forgiveness; several times he
      ran to the table in despair, and wrote:

 “Mother!”

 Except his mother, he had no relations or near friends; but how could his
      mother help him? And where was she? He had an impulse to run to Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna, to fall at her feet, to kiss her hands and feet, to beg her
      forgiveness; but she was his victim, and he was afraid of her as though
      she were dead.

 “My life is ruined,” he repeated, rubbing his hands. “Why
      am I still alive, my God! . . .”

 He had cast out of heaven his dim star; it had fallen, and its track was
      lost in the darkness of night. It would never return to the sky again,
      because life was given only once and never came a second time. If he could
      have turned back the days and years of the past, he would have replaced
      the falsity with truth, the idleness with work, the boredom with
      happiness; he would have given back purity to those whom he had robbed of
      it. He would have found God and goodness, but that was as impossible as to
      put back the fallen star into the sky, and because it was impossible he
      was in despair.

 When the storm was over, he sat by the open window and thought calmly of
      what was before him. Von Koren would most likely kill him. The man’s
      clear, cold theory of life justified the destruction of the rotten and the
      useless; if it changed at the crucial moment, it would be the hatred and
      the repugnance that Laevsky inspired in him that would save him. If he
      missed his aim or, in mockery of his hated opponent, only wounded him, or
      fired in the air, what could he do then? Where could he go?

 “Go to Petersburg?” Laevsky asked himself. But that would mean
      beginning over again the old life which he cursed. And the man who seeks
      salvation in change of place like a migrating bird would find nothing
      anywhere, for all the world is alike to him. Seek salvation in men? In
      whom and how? Samoylenko’s kindness and generosity could no more
      save him than the deacon’s laughter or Von Koren’s hatred. He
      must look for salvation in himself alone, and if there were no finding it,
      why waste time? He must kill himself, that was all. . . .

 He heard the sound of a carriage. It was getting light. The carriage
      passed by, turned, and crunching on the wet sand, stopped near the house.
      There were two men in the carriage.

 “Wait a minute; I’m coming directly,” Laevsky said to
      them out of the window. “I’m not asleep. Surely it’s not
      time yet?”

 “Yes, it’s four o’clock. By the time we get there . . .
      .”

 Laevsky put on his overcoat and cap, put some cigarettes in his pocket,
      and stood still hesitating. He felt as though there was something else he
      must do. In the street the seconds talked in low voices and the horses
      snorted, and this sound in the damp, early morning, when everybody was
      asleep and light was hardly dawning in the sky, filled Laevsky’s
      soul with a disconsolate feeling which was like a presentiment of evil. He
      stood for a little, hesitating, and went into the bedroom.

 Nadyezhda Fyodorovna was lying stretched out on the bed, wrapped from head
      to foot in a rug. She did not stir, and her whole appearance, especially
      her head, suggested an Egyptian mummy. Looking at her in silence, Laevsky
      mentally asked her forgiveness, and thought that if the heavens were not
      empty and there really were a God, then He would save her; if there were
      no God, then she had better perish—there was nothing for her to live
      for.

 All at once she jumped up, and sat up in bed. Lifting her pale face and
      looking with horror at Laevsky, she asked:

 “Is it you? Is the storm over?”

 “Yes.”

 She remembered; put both hands to her head and shuddered all over.

 “How miserable I am!” she said. “If only you knew how
      miserable I am! I expected,” she went on, half closing her eyes,
      “that you would kill me or turn me out of the house into the rain
      and storm, but you delay . . . delay . . .”

 Warmly and impulsively he put his arms round her and covered her knees and
      hands with kisses. Then when she muttered something and shuddered with the
      thought of the past, he stroked her hair, and looking into her face,
      realised that this unhappy, sinful woman was the one creature near and
      dear to him, whom no one could replace.

 When he went out of the house and got into the carriage he wanted to
      return home alive.

 XVIII

 The deacon got up, dressed, took his thick, gnarled stick and slipped
      quietly out of the house. It was dark, and for the first minute when he
      went into the street, he could not even see his white stick. There was not
      a single star in the sky, and it looked as though there would be rain
      again. There was a smell of wet sand and sea.

 “It’s to be hoped that the mountaineers won’t attack us,”
      thought the deacon, hearing the tap of the stick on the pavement, and
      noticing how loud and lonely the taps sounded in the stillness of the
      night.

 When he got out of town, he began to see both the road and his stick. Here
      and there in the black sky there were dark cloudy patches, and soon a star
      peeped out and timidly bGlinked its one eye. The deacon walked along the
      high rocky coast and did not see the sea; it was slumbering below, and its
      unseen waves broke languidly and heavily on the shore, as though sighing
      “Ouf!” and how slowly! One wave broke—the deacon had
      time to count eight steps; then another broke, and six steps; later a
      third. As before, nothing could be seen, and in the darkness one could
      hear the languid, drowsy drone of the sea. One could hear the infinitely
      faraway, inconceivable time when God moved above chaos.

 The deacon felt uncanny. He hoped God would not punish him for keeping
      company with infidels, and even going to look at their duels. The duel
      would be nonsensical, bloodless, absurd, but however that might be, it was
      a heathen spectacle, and it was altogether unseemly for an ecclesiastical
      person to be present at it. He stopped and wondered—should he go
      back? But an intense, restless curiosity triumphed over his doubts, and he
      went on.

 “Though they are infidels they are good people, and will be saved,”
      he assured himself. “They are sure to be saved,” he said
      aloud, lighting a cigarette.

 By what standard must one measure men’s qualities, to judge rightly
      of them? The deacon remembered his enemy, the inspector of the clerical
      school, who believed in God, lived in chastity, and did not fight duels;
      but he used to feed the deacon on bread with sand in it, and on one
      occasion almost pulled off the deacon’s ear. If human life was so
      artlessly constructed that every one respected this cruel and dishonest
      inspector who stole the Government flour, and his health and salvation
      were prayed for in the schools, was it just to shun such men as Von Koren
      and Laevsky, simply because they were unbelievers? The deacon was weighing
      this question, but he recalled how absurd Samoylenko had looked yesterday,
      and that broke the thread of his ideas. What fun they would have next day!
      The deacon imagined how he would sit under a bush and look on, and when
      Von Koren began boasting next day at dinner, he, the deacon, would begin
      laughing and telling him all the details of the duel.

 “How do you know all about it?” the zoologist would ask.

 “Well, there you are! I stayed at home, but I know all about it.”

 It would be nice to write a comic description of the duel. His
      father-in-law would read it and laugh. A good story, told or written, was
      more than meat and drink to his father-in-law.

 The valley of the Yellow River opened before him. The stream was broader
      and fiercer for the rain, and instead of murmuring as before, it was
      raging. It began to get light. The grey, dingy morning, and the clouds
      racing towards the west to overtake the storm-clouds, the mountains girt
      with mist, and the wet trees, all struck the deacon as ugly and sinister.
      He washed at the brook, repeated his morning prayer, and felt a longing
      for tea and hot rolls, with sour cream, which were served every morning at
      his father-in-law’s. He remembered his wife and the “Days past
      Recall,” which she played on the piano. What sort of woman was she?
      His wife had been introduced, betrothed, and married to him all in one
      week: he had lived with her less than a month when he was ordered here, so
      that he had not had time to find out what she was like. All the same, he
      rather missed her.

 “I must write her a nice letter . . .” he thought. The flag on
      the duhan hung limp, soaked by the rain, and the duhan itself with its wet roof seemed darker and lower than it had been before.
      Near the door was standing a cart; Kerbalay, with two mountaineers and a
      young Tatar woman in trousers—no doubt Kerbalay’s wife or
      daughter—were bringing sacks of something out of the duhan ,
      and putting them on maize straw in the cart.

 Near the cart stood a pair of asses hanging their heads. When they had put
      in all the sacks, the mountaineers and the Tatar woman began covering them
      over with straw, while Kerbalay began hurriedly harnessing the asses.

 “Smuggling, perhaps,” thought the deacon.

 Here was the fallen tree with the dried pine-needles, here was the
      blackened patch from the fire. He remembered the picnic and all its
      incidents, the fire, the singing of the mountaineers, his sweet dreams of
      becoming a bishop, and of the Church procession. . . . The Black River had
      grown blacker and broader with the rain. The deacon walked cautiously over
      the narrow bridge, which by now was reached by the topmost crests of the
      dirty water, and went up through the little copse to the drying-shed.

 “A splendid head,” he thought, stretching himself on the
      straw, and thinking of Von Koren. “A fine head—God grant him
      health; only there is cruelty in him. . . .”

 Why did he hate Laevsky and Laevsky hate him? Why were they going to fight
      a duel? If from their childhood they had known poverty as the deacon had;
      if they had been brought up among ignorant, hard-hearted, grasping, coarse
      and ill-mannered people who grudged you a crust of bread, who spat on the
      floor and hiccoughed at dinner and at prayers; if they had not been spoilt
      from childhood by the pleasant surroundings and the select circle of
      friends they lived in—how they would have rushed at each other, how
      readily they would have overlooked each other’s shortcomings and
      would have prized each other’s strong points! Why, how few even
      outwardly decent people there were in the world! It was true that Laevsky
      was flighty, dissipated, queer, but he did not steal, did not spit loudly
      on the floor; he did not abuse his wife and say, “You’ll eat
      till you burst, but you don’t want to work;” he would not beat
      a child with reins, or give his servants stinking meat to eat—
      surely this was reason enough to be indulgent to him? Besides, he was the
      chief sufferer from his failings, like a sick man from his sores. Instead
      of being led by boredom and some sort of misunderstanding to look for
      degeneracy, extinction, heredity, and other such incomprehensible things
      in each other, would they not do better to stoop a little lower and turn
      their hatred and anger where whole streets resounded with moanings from
      coarse ignorance, greed, scolding, impurity, swearing, the shrieks of
      women. . . .

 The sound of a carriage interrupted the deacon’s thoughts. He
      glanced out of the door and saw a carriage and in it three persons:
      Laevsky, Sheshkovsky, and the superintendent of the post-office.

 “Stop!” said Sheshkovsky.

 All three got out of the carriage and looked at one another.

 “They are not here yet,” said Sheshkovsky, shaking the mud
      off. “Well? Till the show begins, let us go and find a suitable
      spot; there’s not room to turn round here.”

 They went further up the river and soon vanished from sight. The Tatar
      driver sat in the carriage with his head resting on his shoulder and fell
      asleep. After waiting ten minutes the deacon came out of the drying-shed,
      and taking off his black hat that he might not be noticed, he began
      threading his way among the bushes and strips of maize along the bank,
      crouching and looking about him. The grass and maize were wet, and big
      drops fell on his head from the trees and bushes. “Disgraceful!”
      he muttered, picking up his wet and muddy skirt. “Had I realised it,
      I would not have come.”

 Soon he heard voices and caught sight of them. Laevsky was walking rapidly
      to and fro in the small glade with bowed back and hands thrust in his
      sleeves; his seconds were standing at the water’s edge, rolling
      cigarettes.

 “Strange,” thought the deacon, not recognising Laevsky’s
      walk; “he looks like an old man. . . .”

 “How rude it is of them!” said the superintendent of the
      post-office, looking at his watch. “It may be learned manners to be
      late, but to my thinking it’s hoggish.”

 Sheshkovsky, a stout man with a black beard, listened and said:

 “They’re coming!”

 XIX

 “It’s the first time in my life I’ve seen it! How
      glorious!” said Von Koren, pointing to the glade and stretching out
      his hands to the east. “Look: green rays!”

 In the east behind the mountains rose two green streaks of light, and it
      really was beautiful. The sun was rising.

 “Good-morning!” the zoologist went on, nodding to Laevsky’s
      seconds. “I’m not late, am I?”

 He was followed by his seconds, Boyko and Govorovsky, two very young
      officers of the same height, wearing white tunics, and Ustimovitch, the
      thin, unsociable doctor; in one hand he had a bag of some sort, and in the
      other hand, as usual, a cane which he held behind him. Laying the bag on
      the ground and greeting no one, he put the other hand, too, behind his
      back and began pacing up and down the glade.

 Laevsky felt the exhaustion and awkwardness of a man who is soon perhaps
      to die, and is for that reason an object of general attention. He wanted
      to be killed as soon as possible or taken home. He saw the sunrise now for
      the first time in his life; the early morning, the green rays of light,
      the dampness, and the men in wet boots, seemed to him to have nothing to
      do with his life, to be superfluous and embarrassing. All this had no
      connection with the night he had been through, with his thoughts and his
      feeling of guilt, and so he would have gladly gone away without waiting
      for the duel.

 Von Koren was noticeably excited and tried to conceal it, pretending that
      he was more interested in the green light than anything. The seconds were
      confused, and looked at one another as though wondering why they were here
      and what they were to do.

 “I imagine, gentlemen, there is no need for us to go further,”
      said Sheshkovsky. “This place will do.”

 “Yes, of course,” Von Koren agreed.

 A silence followed. Ustimovitch, pacing to and fro, suddenly turned
      sharply to Laevsky and said in a low voice, breathing into his face:

 “They have very likely not told you my terms yet. Each side is to
      pay me fifteen roubles, and in the case of the death of one party, the
      survivor is to pay thirty.”

 Laevsky was already acquainted with the man, but now for the first time he
      had a distinct view of his lustreless eyes, his stiff moustaches, and
      wasted, consumptive neck; he was a money-grubber, not a doctor; his breath
      had an unpleasant smell of beef.

 “What people there are in the world!” thought Laevsky, and
      answered: “Very good.”

 The doctor nodded and began pacing to and fro again, and it was evident he
      did not need the money at all, but simply asked for it from hatred. Every
      one felt it was time to begin, or to end what had been begun, but instead
      of beginning or ending, they stood about, moved to and fro and smoked. The
      young officers, who were present at a duel for the first time in their
      lives, and even now hardly believed in this civilian and, to their
      thinking, unnecessary duel, looked critically at their tunics and stroked
      their sleeves. Sheshkovsky went up to them and said softly: “Gentlemen,
      we must use every effort to prevent this duel; they ought to be
      reconciled.”

 He flushed crimson and added:

 “Kirilin was at my rooms last night complaining that Laevsky had
      found him with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, and all that sort of thing.”

 “Yes, we know that too,” said Boyko.

 “Well, you see, then . . . Laevsky’s hands are trembling and
      all that sort of thing . . . he can scarcely hold a pistol now. To fight
      with him is as inhuman as to fight a man who is drunk or who has typhoid.
      If a reconciliation cannot be arranged, we ought to put off the duel,
      gentlemen, or something. . . . It’s such a sickening business, I can’t
      bear to see it.”

 “Talk to Von Koren.”

 “I don’t know the rules of duelling, damnation take them, and
      I don’t want to either; perhaps he’ll imagine Laevsky funks it
      and has sent me to him, but he can think what he likes—I’ll
      speak to him.”

 Sheshkovsky hesitatingly walked up to Von Koren with a slight limp, as
      though his leg had gone to sleep; and as he went towards him, clearing his
      throat, his whole figure was a picture of indolence.

 “There’s something I must say to you, sir,” he began,
      carefully scrutinising the flowers on the zoologist’s shirt. “It’s
      confidential. I don’t know the rules of duelling, damnation take
      them, and I don’t want to, and I look on the matter not as a second
      and that sort of thing, but as a man, and that’s all about it.”

 “Yes. Well?”

 “When seconds suggest reconciliation they are usually not listened
      to; it is looked upon as a formality. Amour propre and all that.
      But I humbly beg you to look carefully at Ivan Andreitch. He’s not
      in a normal state, so to speak, to-day—not in his right mind, and a
      pitiable object. He has had a misfortune. I can’t endure gossip. . .
      .”

 Sheshkovsky flushed crimson and looked round.

 “But in view of the duel, I think it necessary to inform you,
      Laevsky found his madam last night at Muridov’s with . . . another
      gentleman.”

 “How disgusting!” muttered the zoologist; he turned pale,
      frowned, and spat loudly. “Tfoo!”

 His lower lip quivered, he walked away from Sheshkovsky, unwilling to hear
      more, and as though he had accidentally tasted something bitter, spat
      loudly again, and for the first time that morning looked with hatred at
      Laevsky. His excitement and awkwardness passed off; he tossed his head and
      said aloud:

 “Gentlemen, what are we waiting for, I should like to know? Why don’t
      we begin?”

 Sheshkovsky glanced at the officers and shrugged his shoulders.

 “Gentlemen,” he said aloud, addressing no one in particular.
      “Gentlemen, we propose that you should be reconciled.”

 “Let us make haste and get the formalities over,” said Von
      Koren. “Reconciliation has been discussed already. What is the next
      formality? Make haste, gentlemen, time won’t wait for us.”

 “But we insist on reconciliation all the same,” said
      Sheshkovsky in a guilty voice, as a man compelled to interfere in another
      man’s business; he flushed, laid his hand on his heart, and went on:
      “Gentlemen, we see no grounds for associating the offence with the
      duel. There’s nothing in common between duelling and offences
      against one another of which we are sometimes guilty through human
      weakness. You are university men and men of culture, and no doubt you see
      in the duel nothing but a foolish and out-of-date formality, and all that
      sort of thing. That’s how we look at it ourselves, or we shouldn’t
      have come, for we cannot allow that in our presence men should fire at one
      another, and all that.” Sheshkovsky wiped the perspiration off his
      face and went on: “Make an end to your misunderstanding, gentlemen;
      shake hands, and let us go home and drink to peace. Upon my honour,
      gentlemen!”

 Von Koren did not speak. Laevsky, seeing that they were looking at him,
      said:

 “I have nothing against Nikolay Vassilitch; if he considers I’m
      to blame, I’m ready to apologise to him.”

 Von Koren was offended.

 “It is evident, gentlemen,” he said, “you want Mr.
      Laevsky to return home a magnanimous and chivalrous figure, but I cannot
      give you and him that satisfaction. And there was no need to get up early
      and drive eight miles out of town simply to drink to peace, to have
      breakfast, and to explain to me that the duel is an out-of-date formality.
      A duel is a duel, and there is no need to make it more false and stupid
      than it is in reality. I want to fight!”

 A silence followed. Boyko took a pair of pistols out of a box; one was
      given to Von Koren and one to Laevsky, and then there followed a
      difficulty which afforded a brief amusement to the zoologist and the
      seconds. It appeared that of all the people present not one had ever in
      his life been at a duel, and no one knew precisely how they ought to
      stand, and what the seconds ought to say and do. But then Boyko remembered
      and began, with a smile, to explain.

 “Gentlemen, who remembers the description in Lermontov?” asked
      Von Koren, laughing. “In Turgenev, too, Bazarov had a duel with some
      one. . . .”

 “There’s no need to remember,” said Ustimovitch
      impatiently. “Measure the distance, that’s all.”

 And he took three steps as though to show how to measure it. Boyko counted
      out the steps while his companion drew his sabre and scratched the earth
      at the extreme points to mark the barrier. In complete silence the
      opponents took their places.

 “Moles,” the deacon thought, sitting in the bushes.

 Sheshkovsky said something, Boyko explained something again, but Laevsky
      did not hear—or rather heard, but did not understand. He cocked his
      pistol when the time came to do so, and raised the cold, heavy weapon with
      the barrel upwards. He forgot to unbutton his overcoat, and it felt very
      tight over his shoulder and under his arm, and his arm rose as awkwardly
      as though the sleeve had been cut out of tin. He remembered the hatred he
      had felt the night before for the swarthy brow and curly hair, and felt
      that even yesterday at the moment of intense hatred and anger he could not
      have shot a man. Fearing that the bullet might somehow hit Von Koren by
      accident, he raised the pistol higher and higher, and felt that this too
      obvious magnanimity was indelicate and anything but magnanimous, but he
      did not know how else to do and could do nothing else. Looking at the
      pale, ironically smiling face of Von Koren, who evidently had been
      convinced from the beginning that his opponent would fire in the air,
      Laevsky thought that, thank God, everything would be over directly, and
      all that he had to do was to press the trigger rather hard. . . .

 He felt a violent shock on the shoulder; there was the sound of a shot and
      an answering echo in the mountains: ping-ting!

 Von Koren cocked his pistol and looked at Ustimovitch, who was pacing as
      before with his hands behind his back, taking no notice of any one.

 “Doctor,” said the zoologist, “be so good as not to move
      to and fro like a pendulum. You make me dizzy.”

 The doctor stood still. Von Koren began to take aim at Laevsky.

 “It’s all over!” thought Laevsky.

 The barrel of the pistol aimed straight at his face, the expression of
      hatred and contempt in Von Koren’s attitude and whole figure, and
      the murder just about to be committed by a decent man in broad daylight,
      in the presence of decent men, and the stillness and the unknown force
      that compelled Laevsky to stand still and not to run —how mysterious
      it all was, how incomprehensible and terrible!

 The moment while Von Koren was taking aim seemed to Laevsky longer than a
      night: he glanced imploringly at the seconds; they were pale and did not
      stir.

 “Make haste and fire,” thought Laevsky, and felt that his
      pale, quivering, and pitiful face must arouse even greater hatred in Von
      Koren.

 “I’ll kill him directly,” thought Von Koren, aiming at
      his forehead, with his finger already on the catch. “Yes, of course
      I’ll kill him.”

 “He’ll kill him!” A despairing shout was suddenly heard
      somewhere very close at hand.

 A shot rang out at once. Seeing that Laevsky remained standing where he
      was and did not fall, they all looked in the direction from which the
      shout had come, and saw the deacon. With pale face and wet hair sticking
      to his forehead and his cheeks, wet through and muddy, he was standing in
      the maize on the further bank, smiling rather queerly and waving his wet
      hat. Sheshkovsky laughed with joy, burst into tears, and moved away. . . .

 XX

 A little while afterwards, Von Koren and the deacon met near the little
      bridge. The deacon was excited; he breathed hard, and avoided looking in
      people’s faces. He felt ashamed both of his terror and his muddy,
      wet garments.

 “I thought you meant to kill him . . .” he muttered. “How
      contrary to human nature it is! How utterly unnatural it is!”

 “But how did you come here?” asked the zoologist.

 “Don’t ask,” said the deacon, waving his hand. “The
      evil one tempted me, saying: ‘Go, go. . . .’ So I went and
      almost died of fright in the maize. But now, thank God, thank God. . . . I
      am awfully pleased with you,” muttered the deacon. “Old
      Grandad Tarantula will be glad . . . . It’s funny, it’s too
      funny! Only I beg of you most earnestly don’t tell anybody I was
      there, or I may get into hot water with the authorities. They will say:
      ‘The deacon was a second.’”

 “Gentlemen,” said Von Koren, “the deacon asks you not to
      tell any one you’ve seen him here. He might get into trouble.”

 “How contrary to human nature it is!” sighed the deacon.
      “Excuse my saying so, but your face was so dreadful that I thought
      you were going to kill him.”

 “I was very much tempted to put an end to that scoundrel,”
      said Von Koren, “but you shouted close by, and I missed my aim. The
      whole procedure is revolting to any one who is not used to it, and it has
      exhausted me, deacon. I feel awfully tired. Come along. . . .”

 “No, you must let me walk back. I must get dry, for I am wet and
      cold.”

 “Well, as you like,” said the zoologist, in a weary tone,
      feeling dispirited, and, getting into the carriage, he closed his eyes.
      “As you like. . . .”

 While they were moving about the carriages and taking their seats,
      Kerbalay stood in the road, and, laying his hands on his stomach, he bowed
      low, showing his teeth; he imagined that the gentry had come to enjoy the
      beauties of nature and drink tea, and could not understand why they were
      getting into the carriages. The party set off in complete silence and only
      the deacon was left by the duhan .

 “Come to the duhan , drink tea,” he said to Kerbalay.
      “Me wants to eat.”

 Kerbalay spoke good Russian, but the deacon imagined that the Tatar would
      understand him better if he talked to him in broken Russian. “Cook
      omelette, give cheese. . . .”

 “Come, come, father,” said Kerbalay, bowing. “I’ll
      give you everything . . . . I’ve cheese and wine. . . . Eat what you
      like.”

 “What is ‘God’ in Tatar?” asked the deacon, going
      into the duhan .

 “Your God and my God are the same,” said Kerbalay, not
      understanding him. “God is the same for all men, only men are
      different. Some are Russian, some are Turks, some are English—there
      are many sorts of men, but God is one.”

 “Very good. If all men worship the same God, why do you Mohammedans
      look upon Christians as your everlasting enemies?”

 “Why are you angry?” said Kerbalay, laying both hands on his
      stomach. “You are a priest; I am a Mussulman: you say, ‘I want
      to eat’—I give it you. . . . Only the rich man distinguishes
      your God from my God; for the poor man it is all the same. If you please,
      it is ready.”

 While this theological conversation was taking place at the duhan ,
      Laevsky was driving home thinking how dreadful it had been driving there
      at daybreak, when the roads, the rocks, and the mountains were wet and
      dark, and the uncertain future seemed like a terrible abyss, of which one
      could not see the bottom; while now the raindrops hanging on the grass and
      on the stones were sparkling in the sun like diamonds, nature was smiling
      joyfully, and the terrible future was left behind. He looked at
      Sheshkovsky’s sullen, tear-stained face, and at the two carriages
      ahead of them in which Von Koren, his seconds, and the doctor were
      sitting, and it seemed to him as though they were all coming back from a
      graveyard in which a wearisome, insufferable man who was a burden to
      others had just been buried.

 “Everything is over,” he thought of his past, cautiously
      touching his neck with his fingers.

 On the right side of his neck was a small swelling, of the length and
      breadth of his little finger, and he felt a pain, as though some one had
      passed a hot iron over his neck. The bullet had bruised it.

 Afterwards, when he got home, a strange, long, sweet day began for him,
      misty as forgetfulness. Like a man released from prison or from hospital,
      he stared at the long-familiar objects and wondered that the tables, the
      windows, the chairs, the light, and the sea stirred in him a keen,
      childish delight such as he had not known for long, long years. Nadyezhda
      Fyodorovna, pale and haggard, could not understand his gentle voice and
      strange movements; she made haste to tell him everything that had happened
      to her. . . . It seemed to her that very likely he scarcely heard and did
      not understand her, and that if he did know everything he would curse her
      and kill her, but he listened to her, stroked her face and hair, looked
      into her eyes and said:

 “I have nobody but you. . . .”

 Then they sat a long while in the garden, huddled close together, saying
      nothing, or dreaming aloud of their happy life in the future, in brief,
      broken sentences, while it seemed to him that he had never spoken at such
      length or so eloquently.

 XXI

 More than three months had passed.

 The day came that Von Koren had fixed on for his departure. A cold, heavy
      rain had been falling from early morning, a north-east wind was blowing,
      and the waves were high on the sea. It was said that the steamer would
      hardly be able to come into the harbour in such weather. By the time-table
      it should have arrived at ten o’clock in the morning, but Von Koren,
      who had gone on to the sea-front at midday and again after dinner, could
      see nothing through the field-glass but grey waves and rain covering the
      horizon.

 Towards the end of the day the rain ceased and the wind began to drop
      perceptibly. Von Koren had already made up his mind that he would not be
      able to get off that day, and had settled down to play chess with
      Samoylenko; but after dark the orderly announced that there were lights on
      the sea and that a rocket had been seen.

 Von Koren made haste. He put his satchel over his shoulder, and kissed
      Samoylenko and the deacon. Though there was not the slightest necessity,
      he went through the rooms again, said good-bye to the orderly and the
      cook, and went out into the street, feeling that he had left something
      behind, either at the doctor’s or his lodging. In the street he
      walked beside Samoylenko, behind them came the deacon with a box, and last
      of all the orderly with two portmanteaus. Only Samoylenko and the orderly
      could distinguish the dim lights on the sea. The others gazed into the
      darkness and saw nothing. The steamer had stopped a long way from the
      coast.

 “Make haste, make haste,” Von Koren hurried them. “I am
      afraid it will set off.”

 As they passed the little house with three windows, into which Laevsky had
      moved soon after the duel, Von Koren could not resist peeping in at the
      window. Laevsky was sitting, writing, bent over the table, with his back
      to the window.

 “I wonder at him!” said the zoologist softly. “What a
      screw he has put on himself!”

 “Yes, one may well wonder,” said Samoylenko. “He sits
      from morning till night, he’s always at work. He works to pay off
      his debts. And he lives, brother, worse than a beggar!”

 Half a minute of silence followed. The zoologist, the doctor, and the
      deacon stood at the window and went on looking at Laevsky.

 “So he didn’t get away from here, poor fellow,” said
      Samoylenko. “Do you remember how hard he tried?”

 “Yes, he has put a screw on himself,” Von Koren repeated.
      “His marriage, the way he works all day long for his daily bread, a
      new expression in his face, and even in his walk—it’s all so
      extraordinary that I don’t know what to call it.”

 The zoologist took Samoylenko’s sleeve and went on with emotion in
      his voice:

 “You tell him and his wife that when I went away I was full of
      admiration for them and wished them all happiness . . . and I beg him, if
      he can, not to remember evil against me. He knows me. He knows that if I
      could have foreseen this change, then I might have become his best friend.”

 “Go in and say good-bye to him.”

 “No, that wouldn’t do.”

 “Why? God knows, perhaps you’ll never see him again.”

 The zoologist reflected, and said:

 “That’s true.”

 Samoylenko tapped softly at the window. Laevsky started and looked round.

 “Vanya, Nikolay Vassilitch wants to say goodbye to you,” said
      Samoylenko. “He is just going away.”

 Laevsky got up from the table, and went into the passage to open the door.
      Samoylenko, the zoologist, and the deacon went into the house.

 “I can only come for one minute,” began the zoologist, taking
      off his goloshes in the passage, and already wishing he had not given way
      to his feelings and come in, uninvited. “It is as though I were
      forcing myself on him,” he thought, “and that’s stupid.”

 “Forgive me for disturbing you,” he said as he went into the
      room with Laevsky, “but I’m just going away, and I had an
      impulse to see you. God knows whether we shall ever meet again.”

 “I am very glad to see you. . . . Please come in,” said
      Laevsky, and he awkwardly set chairs for his visitors as though he wanted
      to bar their way, and stood in the middle of the room, rubbing his hands.

 “I should have done better to have left my audience in the street,”
      thought Von Koren, and he said firmly: “Don’t remember evil
      against me, Ivan Andreitch. To forget the past is, of course, impossible
      —it is too painful, and I’ve not come here to apologise or to
      declare that I was not to blame. I acted sincerely, and I have not changed
      my convictions since then. . . . It is true that I see, to my great
      delight, that I was mistaken in regard to you, but it’s easy to make
      a false step even on a smooth road, and, in fact, it’s the natural
      human lot: if one is not mistaken in the main, one is mistaken in the
      details. Nobody knows the real truth.”

 “No, no one knows the truth,” said Laevsky.

 “Well, good-bye. . . . God give you all happiness.”

 Von Koren gave Laevsky his hand; the latter took it and bowed.

 “Don’t remember evil against me,” said Von Koren.
      “Give my greetings to your wife, and say I am very sorry not to say
      good-bye to her.”

 “She is at home.”

 Laevsky went to the door of the next room, and said:

 “Nadya, Nikolay Vassilitch wants to say goodbye to you.”

 Nadyezhda Fyodorovna came in; she stopped near the doorway and looked
      shyly at the visitors. There was a look of guilt and dismay on her face,
      and she held her hands like a schoolgirl receiving a scolding.

 “I’m just going away, Nadyezhda Fyodorovna,” said Von
      Koren, “and have come to say good-bye.”

 She held out her hand uncertainly, while Laevsky bowed.

 “What pitiful figures they are, though!” thought Von Koren.
      “The life they are living does not come easy to them. I shall be in
      Moscow and Petersburg; can I send you anything?” he asked.

 “Oh!” said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, and she looked anxiously at
      her husband. “I don’t think there’s anything. . . .”

 “No, nothing . . .” said Laevsky, rubbing his hands. “Our
      greetings.”

 Von Koren did not know what he could or ought to say, though as he went in
      he thought he would say a very great deal that would be warm and good and
      important. He shook hands with Laevsky and his wife in silence, and left
      them with a depressed feeling.

 “What people!” said the deacon in a low voice, as he walked
      behind them. “My God, what people! Of a truth, the right hand of God
      has planted this vine! Lord! Lord! One man vanquishes thousands and
      another tens of thousands. Nikolay Vassilitch,” he said
      ecstatically, “let me tell you that to-day you have conquered the
      greatest of man’s enemies—pride.”

 “Hush, deacon! Fine conquerors we are! Conquerors ought to look like
      eagles, while he’s a pitiful figure, timid, crushed; he bows like a
      Chinese idol, and I, I am sad. . . .”

 They heard steps behind them. It was Laevsky, hurrying after them to see
      him off. The orderly was standing on the quay with the two portmanteaus,
      and at a little distance stood four boatmen.

 “There is a wind, though. . . . Brrr!” said Samoylenko.
      “There must be a pretty stiff storm on the sea now! You are not
      going off at a nice time, Koyla.”

 “I’m not afraid of sea-sickness.”

 “That’s not the point. . . . I only hope these rascals won’t
      upset you. You ought to have crossed in the agent’s sloop. Where’s
      the agent’s sloop?” he shouted to the boatmen.

 “It has gone, Your Excellency.”

 “And the Customs-house boat?”

 “That’s gone, too.”

 “Why didn’t you let us know,” said Samoylenko angrily.
      “You dolts!”

 “It’s all the same, don’t worry yourself . . .”
      said Von Koren. “Well, good-bye. God keep you.”

 Samoylenko embraced Von Koren and made the sign of the cross over him
      three times.

 “Don’t forget us, Kolya. . . . Write. . . . We shall look out
      for you next spring.”

 “Good-bye, deacon,” said Von Koren, shaking hands with the
      deacon. “Thank you for your company and for your pleasant
      conversation. Think about the expedition.”

 “Oh Lord, yes! to the ends of the earth,” laughed the deacon.
      “I’ve nothing against it.”

 Von Koren recognised Laevsky in the darkness, and held out his hand
      without speaking. The boatmen were by now below, holding the boat, which
      was beating against the piles, though the breakwater screened it from the
      breakers. Von Koren went down the ladder, jumped into the boat, and sat at
      the helm.

 “Write!” Samoylenko shouted to him. “Take care of
      yourself.”

 “No one knows the real truth,” thought Laevsky, turning up the
      collar of his coat and thrusting his hands into his sleeves.

 The boat turned briskly out of the harbour into the open sea. It vanished
      in the waves, but at once from a deep hollow glided up onto a high
      breaker, so that they could distinguish the men and even the oars. The
      boat moved three yards forward and was sucked two yards back.

 “Write!” shouted Samoylenko; “it’s devilish
      weather for you to go in.”

 “Yes, no one knows the real truth . . .” thought Laevsky,
      looking wearily at the dark, restless sea.

 “It flings the boat back,” he thought; “she makes two
      steps forward and one step back; but the boatmen are stubborn, they work
      the oars unceasingly, and are not afraid of the high waves. The boat goes
      on and on. Now she is out of sight, but in half an hour the boatmen will
      see the steamer lights distinctly, and within an hour they will be by the
      steamer ladder. So it is in life. . . . In the search for truth man makes
      two steps forward and one step back. Suffering, mistakes, and weariness of
      life thrust them back, but the thirst for truth and stubborn will drive
      them on and on. And who knows? Perhaps they will reach the real truth at
      last.”

 “Go—o—od-by—e,” shouted Samoylenko.

 “There’s no sight or sound of them,” said the deacon.
      “Good luck on the journey!”

 It began to spot with rain.
