THE LOG

 The drawing-room was small, full of heavy draperies and discreetly
      fragrant. A large fire burned in the grate and a solitary lamp at one end
      of the mantelpiece threw a soft light on the two persons who were talking.

 She, the mistress of the house, was an old lady with white hair, but one
      of those old ladies whose unwrinkled skin is as smooth as the finest
      paper, and scented, impregnated with perfume, with the delicate essences
      which she had used in her bath for so many years.

 He was a very old friend, who had never married, a constant friend, a
      companion in the journey of life, but nothing more.

 They had not spoken for about a minute, and were both looking at the fire,
      dreaming of no matter what, in one of those moments of friendly silence
      between people who have no need to be constantly talking in order to be
      happy together, when suddenly a large log, a stump covered with burning
      roots, fell out. It fell over the firedogs into the drawing-room and
      rolled on to the carpet, scattering great sparks around it. The old lady,
      with a little scream, sprang to her feet to run away, while he kicked the
      log back on to the hearth and stamped out all the burning sparks with his
      boots.

 When the disaster was remedied, there was a strong smell of burning, and,
      sitting down opposite to his friend, the man looked at her with a smile
      and said, as he pointed to the log:

 “That is the reason why I never married.”

 She looked at him in astonishment, with the inquisitive gaze of women who
      wish to know everything, that eye which women have who are no longer very
      young,—in which a complex, and often roguish, curiosity is
      reflected, and she asked:

 “How so?”

 “Oh, it is a long story,” he replied; “a rather sad and
      unpleasant story.

 “My old friends were often surprised at the coldness which suddenly
      sprang up between one of my best friends whose Christian name was Julien,
      and myself. They could not understand how two such intimate and
      inseparable friends, as we had been, could suddenly become almost
      strangers to one another, and I will tell you the reason of it.

 “He and I used to live together at one time. We were never apart,
      and the friendship that united us seemed so strong that nothing could
      break it.

 “One evening when he came home, he told me that he was going to get
      married, and it gave me a shock as if he had robbed me or betrayed me.
      When a man's friend marries, it is all over between them. The jealous
      affection of a woman, that suspicious, uneasy and carnal affection, will
      not tolerate the sturdy and frank attachment, that attachment of the mind,
      of the heart, and that mutual confidence which exists between two men.

 “You see, however great the love may be that unites them a man and a
      woman are always strangers in mind and intellect; they remain
      belligerents, they belong to different races. There must always be a
      conqueror and a conquered, a master and a slave; now the one, now the
      other—they are never two equals. They press each other's hands,
      those hands trembling with amorous passion; but they never press them with
      a long, strong, loyal pressure, with that pressure which seems to open
      hearts and to lay them bare in a burst of sincere, strong, manly
      affection. Philosophers of old, instead of marrying, and procreating as a
      consolation for their old age children, who would abandon them, sought for
      a good, reliable friend, and grew old with him in that communion of
      thought which can only exist between men.

 “Well, my friend Julien married. His wife was pretty, charming, a
      little, curly-haired blonde, plump and lively, who seemed to worship him.
      At first I went but rarely to their house, feeling myself de trop. But,
      somehow, they attracted me to their home; they were constantly inviting
      me, and seemed very fond of me. Consequently, by degrees, I allowed myself
      to be allured by the charm of their life. I often dined with them, and
      frequently, when I returned home at night, thought that I would do as he
      had done, and get married, as my empty house now seemed very dull.

 “They appeared to be very much in love, and were never apart.

 “Well, one evening Julien wrote and asked me to go to dinner, and I
      naturally went.

 “'My dear fellow,' he said, 'I must go out directly afterward on
      business, and I shall not be back until eleven o'clock; but I shall be
      back at eleven precisely, and I reckon on you to keep Bertha company.'

 “The young woman smiled.

 “'It was my idea,' she said, 'to send for you.'

 “I held out my hand to her.

 “'You are as nice as ever, I said, and I felt a long, friendly
      pressure of my fingers, but I paid no attention to it; so we sat down to
      dinner, and at eight o'clock Julien went out.

 “As soon as he had gone, a kind of strange embarrassment immediately
      seemed to arise between his wife and me. We had never been alone together
      yet, and in spite of our daily increasing intimacy, this tete-a-tete
      placed us in a new position. At first I spoke vaguely of those indifferent
      matters with which one fills up an embarrassing silence, but she did not
      reply, and remained opposite to me with her head down in an undecided
      manner, as if she were thinking over some difficult subject, and as I was
      at a loss for small talk, I held my tongue. It is surprising how hard it
      is at times to find anything to say.

 “And then also I felt something in the air, something I could not
      express, one of those mysterious premonitions that warn one of another
      person's secret intentions in regard to yourself, whether they be good or
      evil.

 “That painful silence lasted some time, and then Bertha said to me:

 “'Will you kindly put a log on the fire for it is going out.'

 “So I opened the box where the wood was kept, which was placed just
      where yours is, took out the largest log and put it on top of the others,
      which were three parts burned, and then silence again reigned in the room.

 “In a few minutes the log was burning so brightly that it scorched
      our faces, and the young woman raised her eyes to mine—eyes that had
      a strange look to me.

 “'It is too hot now,' she said; 'let us go and sit on the sofa over
      there.'

 “So we went and sat on the sofa, and then she said suddenly, looking
      me full in the face:

 “'What would you do if a woman were to tell you that she was in love
      with you?'

 “'Upon my word,' I replied, very much at a loss for an answer, 'I
      cannot foresee such a case; but it would depend very much upon the woman.'

 “She gave a hard, nervous, vibrating laugh; one of those false
      laughs which seem as if they must break thin glass, and then she added:
      'Men are never either venturesome or spiteful.' And, after a moment's
      silence, she continued: 'Have you ever been in love, Monsieur Paul?' I was
      obliged to acknowledge that I certainly had, and she asked me to tell her
      all about it. Whereupon I made up some story or other. She listened to me
      attentively, with frequent signs of disapproval and contempt, and then
      suddenly she said:

 “'No, you understand nothing about the subject. It seems to me that
      real love must unsettle the mind, upset the nerves and distract the head;
      that it must—how shall I express it?—be dangerous, even
      terrible, almost criminal and sacrilegious; that it must be a kind of
      treason; I mean to say that it is bound to break laws, fraternal bonds,
      sacred obligations; when love is tranquil, easy, lawful and without
      dangers, is it really love?'

 “I did not know what answer to give her, and I made this
      philosophical reflection to myself: 'Oh! female brain, here; indeed, you
      show yourself!'

 “While speaking, she had assumed a demure saintly air; and, resting
      on the cushions, she stretched herself out at full length, with her head
      on my shoulder, and her dress pulled up a little so as to show her red
      stockings, which the firelight made look still brighter. In a minute or
      two she continued:

 “'I suppose I have frightened you?' I protested against such a
      notion, and she leaned against my breast altogether, and without looking
      at me, she said: 'If I were to tell you that I love you, what would you
      do?'

 “And before I could think of an answer, she had thrown her arms
      around my neck, had quickly drawn my head down, and put her lips to mine.

 “Oh! My dear friend, I can tell you that I did not feel at all
      happy! What! deceive Julien? become the lover of this little, silly,
      wrong-headed, deceitful woman, who was, no doubt, terribly sensual, and
      whom her husband no longer satisfied.

 “To betray him continually, to deceive him, to play at being in love
      merely because I was attracted by forbidden fruit, by the danger incurred
      and the friendship betrayed! No, that did not suit me, but what was I to
      do? To imitate Joseph would be acting a very stupid and, moreover,
      difficult part, for this woman was enchanting in her perfidy, inflamed by
      audacity, palpitating and excited. Let the man who has never felt on his
      lips the warm kiss of a woman who is ready to give herself to him throw
      the first stone at me.

 “Well, a minute more—you understand what I mean? A minute
      more, and—I should have been—no, she would have been!—I
      beg your pardon, he would have been—when a loud noise made us both
      jump up. The log had fallen into the room, knocking over the fire irons
      and the fender, and on to the carpet, which it had scorched, and had
      rolled under an armchair, which it would certainly set alight.

 “I jumped up like a madman, and, as I was replacing on the fire that
      log which had saved me, the door opened hastily, and Julien came in.

 “'I am free,' he said, with evident pleasure. 'The business was over
      two hours sooner than I expected!'

 “Yes, my dear friend, without that log, I should have been caught in
      the very act, and you know what the consequences would have been!

 “You may be sure that I took good care never to be found in a
      similar situation again, never, never. Soon afterward I saw that Julien
      was giving me the 'cold shoulder,' as they say. His wife was evidently
      undermining our friendship. By degrees he got rid of me, and we have
      altogether ceased to meet.

 “I never married, which ought not to surprise you, I think.”
