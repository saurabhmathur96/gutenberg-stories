THE BEGGAR

  “K

IND sir, be
      so good as to notice a poor, hungry man. I have not tasted food for three
      days. I have not a five-kopeck piece for a night’s lodging. I swear
      by God! For five years I was a village schoolmaster and lost my post
      through the intrigues of the Zemstvo. I was the victim of false witness. I
      have been out of a place for a year now.”

 Skvortsov, a Petersburg lawyer, looked at the speaker’s tattered
      dark blue overcoat, at his muddy, drunken eyes, at the red patches on his
      cheeks, and it seemed to him that he had seen the man before.

 “And now I am offered a post in the Kaluga province,” the
      beggar continued, “but I have not the means for the journey there.
      Graciously help me! I am ashamed to ask, but . . . I am compelled by
      circumstances.”

 Skvortsov looked at his goloshes, of which one was shallow like a shoe,
      while the other came high up the leg like a boot, and suddenly remembered.

 “Listen, the day before yesterday I met you in Sadovoy Street,”
      he said, “and then you told me, not that you were a village
      schoolmaster, but that you were a student who had been expelled. Do you
      remember?”

 “N-o. No, that cannot be so!” the beggar muttered in
      confusion. “I am a village schoolmaster, and if you wish it I can
      show you documents to prove it.”

 “That’s enough lies! You called yourself a student, and even
      told me what you were expelled for. Do you remember?”

 Skvortsov flushed, and with a look of disgust on his face turned away from
      the ragged figure.

 “It’s contemptible, sir!” he cried angrily. “It’s
      a swindle! I’ll hand you over to the police, damn you! You are poor
      and hungry, but that does not give you the right to lie so shamelessly!”

 The ragged figure took hold of the door-handle and, like a bird in a
      snare, looked round the hall desperately.

 “I . . . I am not lying,” he muttered. “I can show
      documents.”

 “Who can believe you?” Skvortsov went on, still indignant.
      “To exploit the sympathy of the public for village schoolmasters and
      students—it’s so low, so mean, so dirty! It’s revolting!”

 Skvortsov flew into a rage and gave the beggar a merciless scolding. The
      ragged fellow’s insolent lying aroused his disgust and aversion, was
      an offence against what he, Skvortsov, loved and prized in himself:
      kindliness, a feeling heart, sympathy for the unhappy. By his lying, by
      his treacherous assault upon compassion, the individual had, as it were,
      defiled the charity which he liked to give to the poor with no misgivings
      in his heart. The beggar at first defended himself, protested with oaths,
      then he sank into silence and hung his head, overcome with shame.

 “Sir!” he said, laying his hand on his heart, “I really
      was . . . lying! I am not a student and not a village schoolmaster. All
      that’s mere invention! I used to be in the Russian choir, and I was
      turned out of it for drunkenness. But what can I do? Believe me, in God’s
      name, I can’t get on without lying—when I tell the truth no
      one will give me anything. With the truth one may die of hunger and freeze
      without a night’s lodging! What you say is true, I understand that,
      but . . . what am I to do?”

 “What are you to do? You ask what are you to do?” cried
      Skvortsov, going close up to him. “Work—that’s what you
      must do! You must work!”

 “Work. . . . I know that myself, but where can I get work?”

 “Nonsense. You are young, strong, and healthy, and could always find
      work if you wanted to. But you know you are lazy, pampered, drunken! You
      reek of vodka like a pothouse! You have become false and corrupt to the
      marrow of your bones and fit for nothing but begging and lying! If you do
      graciously condescend to take work, you must have a job in an office, in
      the Russian choir, or as a billiard-marker, where you will have a salary
      and have nothing to do! But how would you like to undertake manual labour?
      I’ll be bound, you wouldn’t be a house porter or a factory
      hand! You are too genteel for that!”

 “What things you say, really . . .” said the beggar, and he
      gave a bitter smile. “How can I get manual work? It’s rather
      late for me to be a shopman, for in trade one has to begin from a boy; no
      one would take me as a house porter, because I am not of that class . . .
      . And I could not get work in a factory; one must know a trade, and I know
      nothing.”

 “Nonsense! You always find some justification! Wouldn’t you
      like to chop wood?”

 “I would not refuse to, but the regular woodchoppers are out of work
      now.”

 “Oh, all idlers argue like that! As soon as you are offered anything
      you refuse it. Would you care to chop wood for me?”

 “Certainly I will. . .”

 “Very good, we shall see. . . . Excellent. We’ll see!”
      Skvortsov, in nervous haste; and not without malignant pleasure, rubbing
      his hands, summoned his cook from the kitchen.

 “Here, Olga,” he said to her, “take this gentleman to
      the shed and let him chop some wood.”

 The beggar shrugged his shoulders as though puzzled, and irresolutely
      followed the cook. It was evident from his demeanour that he had consented
      to go and chop wood, not because he was hungry and wanted to earn money,
      but simply from shame and amour propre , because he had been taken
      at his word. It was clear, too, that he was suffering from the effects of
      vodka, that he was unwell, and felt not the faintest inclination to work.

 Skvortsov hurried into the dining-room. There from the window which looked
      out into the yard he could see the woodshed and everything that happened
      in the yard. Standing at the window, Skvortsov saw the cook and the beggar
      come by the back way into the yard and go through the muddy snow to the
      woodshed. Olga scrutinized her companion angrily, and jerking her elbow
      unlocked the woodshed and angrily banged the door open.

 “Most likely we interrupted the woman drinking her coffee,”
      thought Skvortsov. “What a cross creature she is!”

 Then he saw the pseudo-schoolmaster and pseudo-student seat himself on a
      block of wood, and, leaning his red cheeks upon his fists, sink into
      thought. The cook flung an axe at his feet, spat angrily on the ground,
      and, judging by the expression of her lips, began abusing him. The beggar
      drew a log of wood towards him irresolutely, set it up between his feet,
      and diffidently drew the axe across it. The log toppled and fell over. The
      beggar drew it towards him, breathed on his frozen hands, and again drew
      the axe along it as cautiously as though he were afraid of its hitting his
      golosh or chopping off his fingers. The log fell over again.

 Skvortsov’s wrath had passed off by now, he felt sore and ashamed at
      the thought that he had forced a pampered, drunken, and perhaps sick man
      to do hard, rough work in the cold.

 “Never mind, let him go on . . .” he thought, going from the
      dining-room into his study. “I am doing it for his good!”

 An hour later Olga appeared and announced that the wood had been chopped
      up.

 “Here, give him half a rouble,” said Skvortsov. “If he
      likes, let him come and chop wood on the first of every month. . . . There
      will always be work for him.”

 On the first of the month the beggar turned up and again earned half a
      rouble, though he could hardly stand. From that time forward he took to
      turning up frequently, and work was always found for him: sometimes he
      would sweep the snow into heaps, or clear up the shed, at another he used
      to beat the rugs and the mattresses. He always received thirty to forty
      kopecks for his work, and on one occasion an old pair of trousers was sent
      out to him.

 When he moved, Skvortsov engaged him to assist in packing and moving the
      furniture. On this occasion the beggar was sober, gloomy, and silent; he
      scarcely touched the furniture, walked with hanging head behind the
      furniture vans, and did not even try to appear busy; he merely shivered
      with the cold, and was overcome with confusion when the men with the vans
      laughed at his idleness, feebleness, and ragged coat that had once been a
      gentleman’s. After the removal Skvortsov sent for him.

 “Well, I see my words have had an effect upon you,” he said,
      giving him a rouble. “This is for your work. I see that you are
      sober and not disinclined to work. What is your name?”

 “Lushkov.”

 “I can offer you better work, not so rough, Lushkov. Can you write?”

 “Yes, sir.”

 “Then go with this note to-morrow to my colleague and he will give
      you some copying to do. Work, don’t drink, and don’t forget
      what I said to you. Good-bye.”

 Skvortsov, pleased that he had put a man in the path of rectitude, patted
      Lushkov genially on the shoulder, and even shook hands with him at
      parting.

 Lushkov took the letter, departed, and from that time forward did not come
      to the back-yard for work.

 Two years passed. One day as Skvortsov was standing at the ticket-office
      of a theatre, paying for his ticket, he saw beside him a little man with a
      lambskin collar and a shabby cat’s-skin cap. The man timidly asked
      the clerk for a gallery ticket and paid for it with kopecks.

 “Lushkov, is it you?” asked Skvortsov, recognizing in the
      little man his former woodchopper. “Well, what are you doing? Are
      you getting on all right?”

 “Pretty well. . . . I am in a notary’s office now. I earn
      thirty-five roubles.”

 “Well, thank God, that’s capital. I rejoice for you. I am
      very, very glad, Lushkov. You know, in a way, you are my godson. It was I
      who shoved you into the right way. Do you remember what a scolding I gave
      you, eh? You almost sank through the floor that time. Well, thank you, my
      dear fellow, for remembering my words.”

 “Thank you too,” said Lushkov. “If I had not come to you
      that day, maybe I should be calling myself a schoolmaster or a student
      still. Yes, in your house I was saved, and climbed out of the pit.”

 “I am very, very glad.”

 “Thank you for your kind words and deeds. What you said that day was
      excellent. I am grateful to you and to your cook, God bless that kind,
      noble-hearted woman. What you said that day was excellent; I am indebted
      to you as long as I live, of course, but it was your cook, Olga, who
      really saved me.”

 “How was that?”

 “Why, it was like this. I used to come to you to chop wood and she
      would begin: ‘Ah, you drunkard! You God-forsaken man! And yet death
      does not take you!’ and then she would sit opposite me, lamenting,
      looking into my face and wailing: ‘You unlucky fellow! You have no
      gladness in this world, and in the next you will burn in hell, poor
      drunkard! You poor sorrowful creature!’ and she always went on in
      that style, you know. How often she upset herself, and how many tears she
      shed over me I can’t tell you. But what affected me most—she
      chopped the wood for me! Do you know, sir, I never chopped a single log
      for you—she did it all! How it was she saved me, how it was I
      changed, looking at her, and gave up drinking, I can’t explain. I
      only know that what she said and the noble way she behaved brought about a
      change in my soul, and I shall never forget it. It’s time to go up,
      though, they are just going to ring the bell.”

 Lushkov bowed and went off to the gallery.
