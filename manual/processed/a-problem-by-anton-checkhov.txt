A PROBLEM
    

THE strictest
      measures were taken that the Uskovs’ family secret might not leak
      out and become generally known. Half of the servants were sent off to the
      theatre or the circus; the other half were sitting in the kitchen and not
      allowed to leave it. Orders were given that no one was to be admitted. The
      wife of the Colonel, her sister, and the governess, though they had been
      initiated into the secret, kept up a pretence of knowing nothing; they sat
      in the dining-room and did not show themselves in the drawing-room or the
      hall.
    

      Sasha Uskov, the young man of twenty-five who was the cause of all the
      commotion, had arrived some time before, and by the advice of kind-hearted
      Ivan Markovitch, his uncle, who was taking his part, he sat meekly in the
      hall by the door leading to the study, and prepared himself to make an
      open, candid explanation.
    

      The other side of the door, in the study, a family council was being held.
      The subject under discussion was an exceedingly disagreeable and delicate
      one. Sasha Uskov had cashed at one of the banks a false promissory note,
      and it had become due for payment three days before, and now his two
      paternal uncles and Ivan Markovitch, the brother of his dead mother, were
      deciding the question whether they should pay the money and save the
      family honour, or wash their hands of it and leave the case to go for
      trial.
    

      To outsiders who have no personal interest in the matter such questions
      seem simple; for those who are so unfortunate as to have to decide them in
      earnest they are extremely difficult. The uncles had been talking for a
      long time, but the problem seemed no nearer decision.
    

      “My friends!” said the uncle who was a colonel, and there was
      a note of exhaustion and bitterness in his voice. “Who says that
      family honour is a mere convention? I don’t say that at all. I am
      only warning you against a false view; I am pointing out the possibility
      of an unpardonable mistake. How can you fail to see it? I am not speaking
      Chinese; I am speaking Russian!”
    

      “My dear fellow, we do understand,” Ivan Markovitch protested
      mildly.
    

      “How can you understand if you say that I don’t believe in
      family honour? I repeat once more: fa-mil-y ho-nour fal-sely un-der-stood
      is a prejudice! Falsely understood! That’s what I say: whatever may
      be the motives for screening a scoundrel, whoever he may be, and helping
      him to escape punishment, it is contrary to law and unworthy of a
      gentleman. It’s not saving the family honour; it’s civic
      cowardice! Take the army, for instance. . . . The honour of the army is
      more precious to us than any other honour, yet we don’t screen our
      guilty members, but condemn them. And does the honour of the army suffer
      in consequence? Quite the opposite!”
    

      The other paternal uncle, an official in the Treasury, a taciturn,
      dull-witted, and rheumatic man, sat silent, or spoke only of the fact that
      the Uskovs’ name would get into the newspapers if the case went for
      trial. His opinion was that the case ought to be hushed up from the first
      and not become public property; but, apart from publicity in the
      newspapers, he advanced no other argument in support of this opinion.
    

      The maternal uncle, kind-hearted Ivan Markovitch, spoke smoothly, softly,
      and with a tremor in his voice. He began with saying that youth has its
      rights and its peculiar temptations. Which of us has not been young, and
      who has not been led astray? To say nothing of ordinary mortals, even
      great men have not escaped errors and mistakes in their youth. Take, for
      instance, the biography of great writers. Did not every one of them
      gamble, drink, and draw down upon himself the anger of right-thinking
      people in his young days? If Sasha’s error bordered upon crime, they
      must remember that Sasha had received practically no education; he had
      been expelled from the high school in the fifth class; he had lost his
      parents in early childhood, and so had been left at the tenderest age
      without guidance and good, benevolent influences. He was nervous,
      excitable, had no firm ground under his feet, and, above all, he had been
      unlucky. Even if he were guilty, anyway he deserved indulgence and the
      sympathy of all compassionate souls. He ought, of course, to be punished,
      but he was punished as it was by his conscience and the agonies he was
      enduring now while awaiting the sentence of his relations. The comparison
      with the army made by the Colonel was delightful, and did credit to his
      lofty intelligence; his appeal to their feeling of public duty spoke for
      the chivalry of his soul, but they must not forget that in each individual
      the citizen is closely Clinked with the Christian. . . .
    

      “Shall we be false to civic duty,” Ivan Markovitch exclaimed
      passionately, “if instead of punishing an erring boy we hold out to
      him a helping hand?”
    

      Ivan Markovitch talked further of family honour. He had not the honour to
      belong to the Uskov family himself, but he knew their distinguished family
      went back to the thirteenth century; he did not forget for a minute,
      either, that his precious, beloved sister had been the wife of one of the
      representatives of that name. In short, the family was dear to him for
      many reasons, and he refused to admit the idea that, for the sake of a
      paltry fifteen hundred roubles, a blot should be cast on the escutcheon
      that was beyond all price. If all the motives he had brought forward were
      not sufficiently convincing, he, Ivan Markovitch, in conclusion, begged
      his listeners to ask themselves what was meant by crime? Crime is an
      immoral act founded upon ill-will. But is the will of man free? Philosophy
      has not yet given a positive answer to that question. Different views were
      held by the learned. The latest school of Lombroso, for instance, denies
      the freedom of the will, and considers every crime as the product of the
      purely anatomical peculiarities of the individual.
    

      “Ivan Markovitch,” said the Colonel, in a voice of entreaty,
      “we are talking seriously about an important matter, and you bring
      in Lombroso, you clever fellow. Think a little, what are you saying all
      this for? Can you imagine that all your thunderings and rhetoric will
      furnish an answer to the question?”
    

      Sasha Uskov sat at the door and listened. He felt neither terror, shame,
      nor depression, but only weariness and inward emptiness. It seemed to him
      that it made absolutely no difference to him whether they forgave him or
      not; he had come here to hear his sentence and to explain himself simply
      because kind-hearted Ivan Markovitch had begged him to do so. He was not
      afraid of the future. It made no difference to him where he was: here in
      the hall, in prison, or in Siberia.
    

      “If Siberia, then let it be Siberia, damn it all!”
    

      He was sick of life and found it insufferably hard. He was inextricably
      involved in debt; he had not a farthing in his pocket; his family had
      become detestable to him; he would have to part from his friends and his
      women sooner or later, as they had begun to be too contemptuous of his
      sponging on them. The future looked black.
    

      Sasha was indifferent, and was only disturbed by one circumstance; the
      other side of the door they were calling him a scoundrel and a criminal.
      Every minute he was on the point of jumping up, bursting into the study
      and shouting in answer to the detestable metallic voice of the Colonel:
    

      “You are lying!”
    

      “Criminal” is a dreadful word—that is what murderers,
      thieves, robbers are; in fact, wicked and morally hopeless people. And
      Sasha was very far from being all that. . . . It was true he owed a great
      deal and did not pay his debts. But debt is not a crime, and it is unusual
      for a man not to be in debt. The Colonel and Ivan Markovitch were both in
      debt. . . .
    

      “What have I done wrong besides?” Sasha wondered.
    

      He had discounted a forged note. But all the young men he knew did the
      same. Handrikov and Von Burst always forged IOU’s from their parents
      or friends when their allowances were not paid at the regular time, and
      then when they got their money from home they redeemed them before they
      became due. Sasha had done the same, but had not redeemed the IOU because
      he had not got the money which Handrikov had promised to lend him. He was
      not to blame; it was the fault of circumstances. It was true that the use
      of another person’s signature was considered reprehensible; but,
      still, it was not a crime but a generally accepted dodge, an ugly
      formality which injured no one and was quite harmless, for in forging the
      Colonel’s signature Sasha had had no intention of causing anybody
      damage or loss.
    

      “No, it doesn’t mean that I am a criminal . . .” thought
      Sasha. “And it’s not in my character to bring myself to commit
      a crime. I am soft, emotional. . . . When I have the money I help the
      poor. . . .”
    

      Sasha was musing after this fashion while they went on talking the other
      side of the door.
    

      “But, my friends, this is endless,” the Colonel declared,
      getting excited. “Suppose we were to forgive him and pay the money.
      You know he would not give up leading a dissipated life, squandering
      money, making debts, going to our tailors and ordering suits in our names!
      Can you guarantee that this will be his last prank? As far as I am
      concerned, I have no faith whatever in his reforming!”
    

      The official of the Treasury muttered something in reply; after him Ivan
      Markovitch began talking blandly and suavely again. The Colonel moved his
      chair impatiently and drowned the other’s words with his detestable
      metallic voice. At last the door opened and Ivan Markovitch came out of
      the study; there were patches of red on his lean shaven face.
    

      “Come along,” he said, taking Sasha by the hand. “Come
      and speak frankly from your heart. Without pride, my dear boy, humbly and
      from your heart.”
    

      Sasha went into the study. The official of the Treasury was sitting down;
      the Colonel was standing before the table with one hand in his pocket and
      one knee on a chair. It was smoky and stifling in the study. Sasha did not
      look at the official or the Colonel; he felt suddenly ashamed and
      uncomfortable. He looked uneasily at Ivan Markovitch and muttered:
    

      “I’ll pay it . . . I’ll give it back. . . .”
    

      “What did you expect when you discounted the IOU?” he heard a
      metallic voice.
    

      “I . . . Handrikov promised to lend me the money before now.”
    

      Sasha could say no more. He went out of the study and sat down again on
      the chair near the door.
    

      He would have been glad to go away altogether at once, but he was choking
      with hatred and he awfully wanted to remain, to tear the Colonel to
      pieces, to say something rude to him. He sat trying to think of something
      violent and effective to say to his hated uncle, and at that moment a
      woman’s figure, shrouded in the twilight, appeared at the
      drawing-room door. It was the Colonel’s wife. She beckoned Sasha to
      her, and, wringing her hands, said, weeping:
    

      “Alexandre, I know you don’t like me, but . . . listen
      to me; listen, I beg you. . . . But, my dear, how can this have happened?
      Why, it’s awful, awful! For goodness’ sake, beg them, defend
      yourself, entreat them.”
    

      Sasha looked at her quivering shoulders, at the big tears that were
      rolling down her cheeks, heard behind his back the hollow, nervous voices
      of worried and exhausted people, and shrugged his shoulders. He had not in
      the least expected that his aristocratic relations would raise such a
      tempest over a paltry fifteen hundred roubles! He could not understand her
      tears nor the quiver of their voices.
    

      An hour later he heard that the Colonel was getting the best of it; the
      uncles were finally inclining to let the case go for trial.
    

      “The matter’s settled,” said the Colonel, sighing.
      “Enough.”
    

      After this decision all the uncles, even the emphatic Colonel, became
      noticeably depressed. A silence followed.
    

      “Merciful Heavens!” sighed Ivan Markovitch. “My poor
      sister!”
    

      And he began saying in a subdued voice that most likely his sister, Sasha’s
      mother, was present unseen in the study at that moment. He felt in his
      soul how the unhappy, saintly woman was weeping, grieving, and begging for
      her boy. For the sake of her peace beyond the grave, they ought to spare
      Sasha.
    

      The sound of a muffled sob was heard. Ivan Markovitch was weeping and
      muttering something which it was impossible to catch through the door. The
      Colonel got up and paced from corner to corner. The long conversation
      began over again.
    

      But then the clock in the drawing-room struck two. The family council was
      over. To avoid seeing the person who had moved him to such wrath, the
      Colonel went from the study, not into the hall, but into the vestibule. .
      . . Ivan Markovitch came out into the hall. . . . He was agitated and
      rubbing his hands joyfully. His tear-stained eyes looked good-humoured and
      his mouth was twisted into a smile.
    

      “Capital,” he said to Sasha. “Thank God! You can go
      home, my dear, and sleep tranquilly. We have decided to pay the sum, but
      on condition that you repent and come with me tomorrow into the country
      and set to work.”
    

      A minute later Ivan Markovitch and Sasha in their great-coats and caps
      were going down the stairs. The uncle was muttering something edifying.
      Sasha did not listen, but felt as though some uneasy weight were gradually
      slipping off his shoulders. They had forgiven him; he was free! A gust of
      joy sprang up within him and sent a sweet chill to his heart. He longed to
      breathe, to move swiftly, to live! Glancing at the street lamps and the
      black sky, he remembered that Von Burst was celebrating his name-day that
      evening at the “Bear,” and again a rush of joy flooded his
      soul. . . .
    

      “I am going!” he decided.
    

      But then he remembered he had not a farthing, that the companions he was
      going to would despise him at once for his empty pockets. He must get hold
      of some money, come what may!
    

      “Uncle, lend me a hundred roubles,” he said to Ivan
      Markovitch.
    

      His uncle, surprised, looked into his face and backed against a lamp-post.
    

      “Give it to me,” said Sasha, shifting impatiently from one
      foot to the other and beginning to pant. “Uncle, I entreat you, give
      me a hundred roubles.”
    

      His face worked; he trembled, and seemed on the point of attacking his
      uncle. . . .
    

      “Won’t you?” he kept asking, seeing that his uncle was
      still amazed and did not understand. “Listen. If you don’t, I’ll
      give myself up tomorrow! I won’t let you pay the IOU! I’ll
      present another false note tomorrow!”
    

      Petrified, muttering something incoherent in his horror, Ivan Markovitch
      took a hundred-rouble note out of his pocket-book and gave it to Sasha.
      The young man took it and walked rapidly away from him. . . .
    

      Taking a sledge, Sasha grew calmer, and felt a rush of joy within him
      again. The “rights of youth” of which kind-hearted Ivan
      Markovitch had spoken at the family council woke up and asserted
      themselves. Sasha pictured the drinking-party before him, and, among the
      bottles, the women, and his friends, the thought flashed through his mind:
    

      “Now I see that I am a criminal; yes, I am a criminal.”
