THE POETIC PRINCIPLE

 IN speaking of the Poetic Principle, I have no design to be either
      thorough or profound. While discussing, very much at random, the
      essentiality of what we call Poetry, my principal purpose will be to cite
      for consideration, some few of those minor English or American poems which
      best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have left the most
      definite impression. By “minor poems” I mean, of course, poems
      of little length. And here, in the beginning, permit me to say a few words
      in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully or
      wrongfully, has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of
      the poem. I hold that a long poem does not exist. I maintain that the
      phrase, “a long poem,” is simply a flat contradiction in
      terms.

 I need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it
      excites, by elevating the soul. The value of the poem is in the ratio of
      this elevating excitement. But all excitements are, through a psychal
      necessity, transient. That degree of excitement which would entitle a poem
      to be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout a composition of
      any great length. After the lapse of half an hour, at the very utmost, it
      flags—fails—a revulsion ensues—and then the poem is, in
      effect, and in fact, no longer such.

 There are, no doubt, many who have found difficulty in reconciling the
      critical dictum that the “Paradise Lost” is to be devoutly
      admired throughout, with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it,
      during perusal, the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum would
      demand. This great work, in fact, is to be regarded as poetical, only
      when, losing sight of that vital requisite in all works of Art, Unity, we
      view it merely as a series of minor poems. If, to preserve its Unity—its
      totality of effect or impression—we read it (as would be necessary)
      at a single sitting, the result is but a constant alternation of
      excitement and depression. After a passage of what we feel to be true
      poetry, there follows, inevitably, a passage of platitude which no
      critical prejudgment can force us to admire; but if, upon completing the
      work, we read it again, omitting the first book—that is to say,
      commencing with the second—we shall be surprised at now finding that
      admirable which we before condemned—that damnable which we had
      previously so much admired. It follows from all this that the ultimate,
      aggregate, or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun, is a
      nullity:—and this is precisely the fact.

 In regard to the Iliad, we have, if not positive proof, at least very good
      reason for believing it intended as a series of lyrics; but, granting the
      epic intention, I can say only that the work is based in an imperfect
      sense of art. The modern epic is, of the supposititious ancient model, but
      an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation. But the day of these artistic
      anomalies is over. If, at any time, any very long poem were popular
      in reality, which I doubt, it is at least clear that no very long poem
      will ever be popular again.

 That the extent of a poetical work is, ceteris paribus, the measure
      of its merit, seems undoubtedly, when we thus state it, a proposition
      sufficiently absurd—yet we are indebted for it to the Quarterly
      Reviews. Surely there can be nothing in mere size, abstractly
      considered—there can be nothing in mere bulk, so far as a
      volume is concerned, which has so continuously elicited admiration from
      these saturnine pamphlets! A mountain, to be sure, by the mere sentiment
      of physical magnitude which it conveys, does impress us with a
      sense of the sublime—but no man is impressed after this fashion
      by the material grandeur of even “The Columbiad.” Even the
      Quarterlies have not instructed us to be so impressed by it. As yet, they have not insisted on our estimating “Lamar”
      tine by the cubic foot, or Pollock by the pound—but what else are we
      to infer from their continual plating about “sustained effort”?
      If, by “sustained effort,” any little gentleman has
      accomplished an epic, let us frankly commend him for the effort—if
      this indeed be a thing conk mendable—but let us forbear praising the
      epic on the effort’s account. It is to be hoped that common sense,
      in the time to come, will prefer deciding upon a work of Art rather by the
      impression it makes—by the effect it produces—than by the time
      it took to impress the effect, or by the amount of “sustained effort”
      which had been found necessary in effecting the impression. The fact is,
      that perseverance is one thing and genius quite another—nor can all
      the Quarterlies in Christendom confound them. By and by, this proposition,
      with many which I have been just urging, will be received as self-evident.
      In the meantime, by being generally condemned as falsities, they will not
      be essentially damaged as truths.

 On the other hand, it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief. Undue
      brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism. A very short poem, while now
      and then producing a brilliant or vivid, never produces a profound or
      enduring effect. There must be the steady pressing down of the stamp upon
      the wax. De Beranger has wrought innumerable things, pungent and
      spirit-stirring, but in general they have been too imponderous to stamp
      themselves deeply into the public attention, and thus, as so many feathers
      of fancy, have been blown aloft only to be whistled down the wind.

 A remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a poem,
      in keeping it out of the popular view, is afforded by the following
      exquisite little Serenade—

 I arise from dreams of thee
         In the first sweet sleep of night,
     When the winds are breathing low,
         And the stars are shining bright.
     I arise from dreams of thee,
         And a spirit in my feet
     Has led me—who knows how?—
         To thy chamber-window, sweet!

     The wandering airs they faint
         On the dark the silent stream—
     The champak odors fail
         Like sweet thoughts in a dream;
     The nightingale’s complaint,
         It dies upon her heart,
     As I must die on shine,
         O, beloved as thou art!

     O, lift me from the grass!
         I die, I faint, I fail!
     Let thy love in kisses rain
         On my lips and eyelids pale.
     My cheek is cold and white, alas!
         My heart beats loud and fast:
     O, press it close to shine again,
         Where it will break at last.

 Very few perhaps are familiar with these lines—yet no less a poet
      than Shelley is their author. Their warm, yet delicate and ethereal
      imagination will be appreciated by all, but by none so thoroughly as by
      him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in
      the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night.

 One of the finest poems by Willis—the very best in my opinion which
      he has ever written—has no doubt, through this same defect of undue
      brevity, been kept back from its proper position, not less in the

 The shadows lay along Broadway,
         ‘Twas near the twilight-tide—
     And slowly there a lady fair
         Was walking in her pride.
     Alone walk’d she; but, viewlessly,
         Walk’d spirits at her side.

     Peace charm’d the street beneath her feet,
         And Honor charm’d the air;
     And all astir looked kind on her,
         And called her good as fair—
     For all God ever gave to her
         She kept with chary care.

     She kept with care her beauties rare
         From lovers warm and true—
     For heart was cold to all but gold,
         And the rich came not to won,
     But honor’d well her charms to sell.
         If priests the selling do.

     Now walking there was one more fair—
         A slight girl, lily-pale;
     And she had unseen company
         To make the spirit quail—
     ‘Twixt Want and Scorn she walk’d forlorn,
         And nothing could avail.

     No mercy now can clear her brow
         From this world’s peace to pray
     For as love’s wild prayer dissolved in air,
         Her woman’s heart gave way!—
     But the sin forgiven by Christ in Heaven
         By man is cursed alway!

 In this composition we find it difficult to recognize the Willis who has
      written so many mere “verses of society.” The lines are not
      only richly ideal, but full of energy, while they breathe an earnestness,
      an evident sincerity of sentiment, for which we look in vain throughout
      all the other works of this author.

 While the epic mania, while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity is
      indispensable, has for some years past been gradually dying out of the
      public mind, by mere dint of its own absurdity, we find it succeeded by a
      heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated, but one which, in the
      brief period it has already endured, may be said to have accomplished more
      in the corruption of our Poetical Literature than all its other enemies
      combined. I allude to the heresy of The Didactic. It has been
      assumed, tacitly and avowedly, directly and indirectly, that the ultimate
      object of all Poetry is Truth. Every poem, it is said, should inculcate a
      morals and by this moral is the poetical merit of the work to be adjudged.
      We Americans especially have patronized this happy idea, and we Bostonians
      very especially have developed it in full. We have taken it into our heads
      that to write a poem simply for the poem’s sake, and to acknowledge
      such to have been our design, would be to confess ourselves radically
      wanting in the true poetic dignity and force:—but the simple fact is
      that would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should
      immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor can exist any work more thoroughly dignified, more supremely noble, than
      this very poem, this poem per se, this poem which is a poem and
      nothing more, this poem written solely for the poem’s sake.

 With as deep a reverence for the True as ever inspired the bosom of man, I
      would nevertheless limit, in some measure, its modes of inculcation. I
      would limit to enforce them. I would not enfeeble them by dissipation. The
      demands of Truth are severe. She has no sympathy with the myrtles. All that which is so indispensable in Song is precisely all that with
      which she has nothing whatever to do. It is but making her a
      flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers. In enforcing a truth
      we need severity rather than efflorescence of language. We must be simple,
      precise, terse. We must be cool, calm, unimpassioned. In a word, we must
      be in that mood which, as nearly as possible, is the exact converse of the
      poetical. He must be blind indeed who does not perceive the radical
      and chasmal difference between the truthful and the poetical modes of
      inculcation. He must be theory-mad beyond redemption who, in spite of
      these differences, shall still persist in attempting to reconcile the
      obstinate oils and waters of Poetry and Truth.

 Dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious
      distinctions, we have the Pure Intellect, Taste, and the Moral Sense. I
      place Taste in the middle, because it is just this position which in the
      mind it occupies. It holds intimate relations with either extreme; but
      from the Moral Sense is separated by so faint a difference that Aristotle
      has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the virtues
      themselves. Nevertheless we find the offices of the trio marked
      with a sufficient distinction. Just as the Intellect concerns itself with
      Truth, so Taste informs us of the Beautiful, while the Moral Sense is
      regardful of Duty. Of this latter, while Conscience teaches the
      obligation, and Reason the expediency, Taste contents herself with
      displaying the charms:—waging war upon Vice solely on the ground of
      her deformity—her disproportion—her animosity to the fitting,
      to the appropriate, to the harmonious—in a word, to Beauty.

 An immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a sense
      of the Beautiful. This it is which administers to his delight in the
      manifold forms, and sounds, and odors and sentiments amid which he exists.
      And just as the lily is repeated in the lake, or the eyes of Amaryllis in
      the mirror, so is the mere oral or written repetition of these forms, and
      sounds, and colors, and odors, and sentiments a duplicate source of the
      light. But this mere repetition is not poetry. He who shall simply sing,
      with however glowing enthusiasm, or with however vivid a truth of
      description, of the sights, and sounds, and odors, and colors, and
      sentiments which greet him in common with all mankind—he, I
      say, has yet failed to prove his divine title. There is still a something
      in the distance which he has been unable to attain. We have still a thirst
      unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us the crystal springs. This
      thirst belongs to the immortality of Man. It is at once a consequence and
      an indication of his perennial existence. It is the desire of the moth for
      the star. It is no mere appreciation of the Beauty before us, but a wild
      effort to reach the Beauty above. Inspired by an ecstatic prescience of
      the glories beyond the grave, we struggle by multiform combinations among
      the things and thoughts of Time to attain a portion of that Loveliness
      whose very elements perhaps appertain to eternity alone. And thus when by
      Poetry, or when by Music, the most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find
      ourselves melted into tears, we weep then, not as the Abbate Gravina
      supposes, through excess of pleasure, but through a certain petulant,
      impatient sorrow at our inability to grasp now, wholly, here on earth, at
      once and for ever, those divine and rapturous joys of which through’ the poem, or through the music, we attain to but brief and
      indeterminate glimpses.

 The struggle to apprehend the supernal Loveliness—this struggle, on
      the part of souls fittingly constituted—has given to the world all that which it (the world) has ever been enabled at once to
      understand and to feel as poetic.

 The Poetic Sentiment, of course, may develop itself in various modes—in
      Painting, in Sculpture, in Architecture, in the Dance—very
      especially in Music—and very peculiarly, and with a wide field, in
      the com position of the Landscape Garden. Our present theme, however, has
      regard only to its manifestation in words. And here let me speak briefly
      on the topic of rhythm. Contenting myself with the certainty that Music,
      in its various modes of metre, rhythm, and rhyme, is of so vast a moment
      in Poetry as never to be wisely rejected—is so vitally important an
      adjunct, that he is simply silly who declines its assistance, I will not
      now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality. It is in Music perhaps
      that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired
      by the Poetic Sentiment, it struggles—the creation of supernal
      Beauty. It may be, indeed, that here this sublime end is, now and
      then, attained in fact. We are often made to feel, with a shivering
      delight, that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which cannot have
      been unfamiliar to the angels. And thus there can be little doubt that in
      the union of Poetry with Music in its popular sense, we shall find the
      widest field for the Poetic development. The old Bards and Minnesingers
      had advantages which we do not possess—and Thomas Moore, singing his
      own songs, was, in the most legitimate manner, perfecting them as poems.

 To recapitulate then:—I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words
      as The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty. Its sole arbiter is Taste.
      With the Intellect or with the Conscience it has only collateral
      relations. Unless incidentally, it has no concern whatever either with
      Duty or with Truth.

 A few words, however, in explanation. That pleasure which is at
      once the most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense, is derived,
      I maintain, from the contemplation of the Beautiful. In the contemplation
      of Beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable elevation,
      or excitement of the soul, which we recognize as the Poetic
      Sentiment, and which is so easily distinguished from Truth, which is the
      satisfaction of the Reason, or from Passion, which is the excitement of
      the heart. I make Beauty, therefore—using the word as inclusive of
      the sublime—I make Beauty the province of the poem, simply because
      it is an obvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring as
      directly as possible from their causes:—no one as yet having been
      weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least most
      readily attainable in the poem. It by no means follows, however, that
      the incitements of Passion’ or the precepts of Duty, or even the
      lessons of Truth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage;
      for they may subserve incidentally, in various ways, the general purposes
      of the work: but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in
      proper subjection to that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the
      real essence of the poem.

 I cannot better introduce the few poems which I shall present for your
      consideration, than by the citation of the Proem to Longfellow’s
      “Waif”:—

 The day is done, and the darkness
         Falls from the wings of Night,
     As a feather is wafted downward
         From an Eagle in his flight.

     I see the lights of the village
         Gleam through the rain and the mist,
     And a feeling of sadness comes o’er me,
         That my soul cannot resist;

     A feeling of sadness and longing,
         That is not akin to pain,
     And resembles sorrow only
         As the mist resembles the rain.

     Come, read to me some poem,
         Some simple and heartfelt lay,
     That shall soothe this restless feeling,
         And banish the thoughts of day.

     Not from the grand old masters,
         Not from the bards sublime,
     Whose distant footsteps echo
         Through the corridors of Time.

     For, like strains of martial music,
         Their mighty thoughts suggest
     Life’s endless toil and endeavor;
         And to-night I long for rest.

     Read from some humbler poet,
         Whose songs gushed from his heart,
     As showers from the clouds of summer,
         Or tears from the eyelids start;

     Who through long days of labor,
         And nights devoid of ease,
     Still heard in his soul the music
         Of wonderful melodies.

     Such songs have power to quiet
         The restless pulse of care,
     And come like the benediction
         That follows after prayer.

     Then read from the treasured volume
         The poem of thy choice,
     And lend to the rhyme of the poet
         The beauty of thy voice.

     And the night shall be filled with music,
         And the cares that infest the day
     Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,
         And as silently steal away.

 With no great range of imagination, these lines have been justly admired
      for their delicacy of expression. Some of the images are very effective.
      Nothing can be better than—

 ———————-the bards sublime,
         Whose distant footsteps echo
     Down the corridors of Time.

 The idea of the last quatrain is also very effective. The poem on the
      whole, however, is chiefly to be admired for the graceful insouciance of its metre, so well in accordance with the character of the
      sentiments, and especially for the ease of the general manner. This
      “ease” or naturalness, in a literary style, it has long been
      the fashion to regard as ease in appearance alone—as a point of
      really difficult attainment. But not so:—a natural manner is
      difficult only to him who should never meddle with it—to the
      unnatural. It is but the result of writing with the understanding, or with
      the instinct, that the tone, in composition, should always be that
      which the mass of mankind would adopt—and must perpetually vary, of
      course, with the occasion. The author who, after the fashion of “The
      North American Review,” should be upon all occasions merely
      “quiet,” must necessarily upon many occasions be simply
      silly, or stupid; and has no more right to be considered “easy”
      or “natural” than a Cockney exquisite, or than the sleeping
      Beauty in the waxworks.

 Among the minor poems of Bryant, none has so much impressed me as the one
      which he entitles “June.” I quote only a portion of it:—

 There, through the long, long summer hours,
         The golden light should lie,
     And thick young herbs and groups of flowers
         Stand in their beauty by.
     The oriole should build and tell
     His love-tale, close beside my cell;
         The idle butterfly
     Should rest him there, and there be heard
     The housewife-bee and humming bird.

     And what, if cheerful shouts at noon,
         Come, from the village sent,
     Or songs of maids, beneath the moon,
         With fairy laughter blent?
     And what if, in the evening light,
     Betrothed lovers walk in sight
         Of my low monument?
     I would the lovely scene around
     Might know no sadder sight nor sound.

     I know, I know I should not see
         The season’s glorious show,
     Nor would its brightness shine for me;
         Nor its wild music flow;
     But if, around my place of sleep,
     The friends I love should come to weep,
         They might not haste to go.
     Soft airs and song, and the light and bloom,
     Should keep them lingering by my tomb.

     These to their soften’d hearts should bear
         The thoughts of what has been,
     And speak of one who cannot share
         The gladness of the scene;
     Whose part in all the pomp that fills
     The circuit of the summer hills,
         Is—that his grave is green;
     And deeply would their hearts rejoice
     To hear again his living voice.

 The rhythmical flow here is even voluptuous—nothing could be more
      melodious. The poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner. The
      intense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of all
      the poet’s cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to
      the soul—while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill.
      The impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness. And if, in the
      remaining compositions which I shall introduce to you, there be more or
      less of a similar tone always apparent, let me remind you that (how or why
      we know not) this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected with
      all the higher manifestations of true Beauty. It is, nevertheless,

 A feeling of sadness and longing
         That is not akin to pain,
     And resembles sorrow only
         As the mist resembles the rain.

 The taint of which I speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full
      of brilliancy and spirit as “The Health” of Edward Coate
      Pinckney:—

 I fill this cup to one made up
         Of loveliness alone,
     A woman, of her gentle sex
         The seeming paragon;
     To whom the better elements
         And kindly stars have given
     A form so fair that, like the air,
         ‘Tis less of earth than heaven.

     Her every tone is music’s own,
         Like those of morning birds,
     And something more than melody
         Dwells ever in her words;
     The coinage of her heart are they,
         And from her lips each flows
     As one may see the burden’d bee
         Forth issue from the rose.

     Affections are as thoughts to her,
         The measures of her hours;
     Her feelings have the flagrancy,
         The freshness of young flowers;
     And lovely passions, changing oft,
         So fill her, she appears
     The image of themselves by turns,—
         The idol of past years!

     Of her bright face one glance will trace
         A picture on the brain,
     And of her voice in echoing hearts
         A sound must long remain;
     But memory, such as mine of her,
         So very much endears,
     When death is nigh my latest sigh
         Will not be life’s, but hers.

     I fill’d this cup to one made up
         Of loveliness alone,
     A woman, of her gentle sex
         The seeming paragon—
     Her health! and would on earth there stood,
         Some more of such a frame,
     That life might be all poetry,
         And weariness a name.

 It was the misfortune of Mr. Pinckney to have been born too far south. Had
      he been a New Englander, it is probable that he would have been ranked as
      the first of American lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which has so long
      controlled the destinies of American Letters, in conducting the thing
      called “The North American Review.” The poem just cited is
      especially beautiful; but the poetic elevation which it induces we must
      refer chiefly to our sympathy in the poet’s enthusiasm. We pardon
      his hyperboles for the evident earnestness with which they are uttered.

 It was by no means my design, however, to expatiate upon the merits of what I should read you. These will necessarily speak for
      themselves. Boccalini, in his “Advertisements from Parnassus,”
      tells us that Zoilus once presented Apollo a very caustic criticism upon a
      very admirable book:—whereupon the god asked him for the beauties of
      the work. He replied that he only busied himself about the errors. On
      hearing this, Apollo, handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat, bade him
      pick out all the chaff for his reward.

 Now this fable answers very well as a hit at the critics—but I am by
      no means sure that the god was in the right. I am by no means certain that
      the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood.
      Excellence, in a poem especially, may be considered in the light of an
      axiom, which need only be properly put, to become self-evident. It
      is not excellence if it require to be demonstrated as such:—and
      thus to point out too particularly the merits of a work of Art, is to
      admit that they are not merits altogether.

 Among the “Melodies” of Thomas Moore is one whose
      distinguished character as a poem proper seems to have been singularly
      left out of view. I allude to his lines beginning—“Come, rest
      in this bosom.” The intense energy of their expression is not
      surpassed by anything in Byron. There are two of the lines in which a
      sentiment is conveyed that embodies the all in all of the divine
      passion of Love—a sentiment which, perhaps, has found its echo in
      more, and in more passionate, human hearts than any other single sentiment
      ever embodied in words:—

 Come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer
     Though the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here;
     Here still is the smile, that no cloud can o’ercast,
     And a heart and a hand all thy own to the last.

     Oh! what was love made for, if ‘tis not the same
     Through joy and through torment, through glory and shame?
     I know not, I ask not, if guilt’s in that heart,
     I but know that I love thee, whatever thou art.

     Thou hast call’d me thy Angel in moments of bliss,
     And thy Angel I’ll be, ‘mid the horrors of this,—
     Through the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue,
     And shield thee, and save thee,—or perish there too!

 It has been the fashion of late days to deny Moore Imagination, while
      granting him Fancy—a distinction originating with Coleridge—than
      whom no man more fully comprehended the great powers of Moore. The fact
      is, that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other
      faculties, and over the fancy of all other men, as to have induced, very
      naturally, the idea that he is fanciful only. But never was there a
      greater mistake. Never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet.
      In the compass of the English language I can call to mind no poem more
      profoundly—more weirdly imaginative, in the best sense, than
      the lines commencing—“I would I were by that dim lake”—which
      are the com. position of Thomas Moore. I regret that I am unable to
      remember them.

 One of the noblest—and, speaking of Fancy—one of the most
      singularly fanciful of modern poets, was Thomas Hood. His “Fair Ines”
      had always for me an inexpressible charm:—

 O saw ye not fair Ines?
         She’s gone into the West,
     To dazzle when the sun is down,
         And rob the world of rest;
     She took our daylight with her,
         The smiles that we love best,
     With morning blushes on her cheek,
         And pearls upon her breast.

     O turn again, fair Ines,
         Before the fall of night,
     For fear the moon should shine alone,
         And stars unrivalltd bright;
     And blessed will the lover be
         That walks beneath their light,
     And breathes the love against thy cheek
         I dare not even write!

     Would I had been, fair Ines,
         That gallant cavalier,
     Who rode so gaily by thy side,
         And whisper’d thee so near!
     Were there no bonny dames at home
         Or no true lovers here,
     That he should cross the seas to win
         The dearest of the dear?

     I saw thee, lovely Ines,
         Descend along the shore,
     With bands of noble gentlemen,
         And banners waved before;
     And gentle youth and maidens gay,
         And snowy plumes they wore;
     It would have been a beauteous dream,
         If it had been no more!

     Alas, alas, fair Ines,
         She went away with song,
     With music waiting on her steps,
         And shootings of the throng;
     But some were sad and felt no mirth,
         But only Music’s wrong,
     In sounds that sang Farewell, Farewell,
         To her you’ve loved so long.

     Farewell, farewell, fair Ines,
         That vessel never bore
     So fair a lady on its deck,
         Nor danced so light before,—
     Alas for pleasure on the sea,
         And sorrow on the shorel
     The smile that blest one lover’s heart
         Has broken many more!

 “The Haunted House,” by the same author, is one of the truest
      poems ever written,—one of the truest, one of the most
      unexceptionable, one of the most thoroughly artistic, both in its theme
      and in its execution. It is, moreover, powerfully ideal—imaginative.
      I regret that its length renders it unsuitable for the purposes of this
      lecture. In place of it permit me to offer the universally appreciated
      “Bridge of Sighs”:—

 One more Unfortunate,
     Weary of breath,
     Rashly importunate
     Gone to her death!

     Take her up tenderly,
     Lift her with care;—
     Fashion’d so slenderly,
     Young and so fair!

     Look at her garments
     Clinging like cerements;
     Whilst the wave constantly
     Drips from her clothing;
     Take her up instantly,
     Loving not loathing.

     Touch her not scornfully;
     Think of her mournfully,
     Gently and humanly;
     Not of the stains of her,
     All that remains of her
     Now is pure womanly.

     Make no deep scrutiny
     Into her mutiny
     Rash and undutiful;
     Past all dishonor,
     Death has left on her
     Only the beautiful.

     Where the lamps quiver
     So far in the river,
     With many a light
     From window and casement
     From garret to basement,
     She stood, with amazement,
     Houseless by night.

     The bleak wind of March
     Made her tremble and shiver,
     But not the dark arch,
     Or the black flowing river:
     Mad from life’s history,
     Glad to death’s mystery,
     Swift to be hurl’d—
     Anywhere, anywhere
     Out of the world!

     In she plunged boldly,
     No matter how coldly
     The rough river ran,—
     Over the brink of it,
     Picture it,—think of it,
     Dissolute Man!
     Lave in it, drink of it
     Then, if you can!

     Still, for all slips of hers,
     One of Eve’s family—
     Wipe those poor lips of hers
     Oozing so clammily,
     Loop up her tresses
     Escaped from the comb,
     Her fair auburn tresses;
     Whilst wonderment guesses
     Where was her home?

     Who was her father?
     Who was her mother?
     Had she a sister?
     Had she a brother?
     Or was there a dearer one
     Still, and a nearer one
     Yet, than all other?

     Alas! for the rarity
     Of Christian charity
     Under the sun!
     Oh! it was pitiful!
     Near a whole city full,
     Home she had none.

     Sisterly, brotherly,
     Fatherly, motherly,
     Feelings had changed:
     Love, by harsh evidence,
     Thrown from its eminence;
     Even God’s providence
     Seeming estranged.

     Take her up tenderly;
     Lift her with care;
     Fashion’d so slenderly,
     Young, and so fair!
     Ere her limbs frigidly
     Stiffen too rigidly,
     Decently,—kindly,—
     Smooth and compose them;
     And her eyes, close them,
     Staring so blindly!

     Dreadfully staring
     Through muddy impurity,
     As when with the daring
     Last look of despairing
     Fixed on futurity.

     Perhishing gloomily,
     Spurred by contumely,
     Cold inhumanity,
     Burning insanity,
     Into her rest,—
     Cross her hands humbly,
     As if praying dumbly,
     Over her breast!
     Owning her weakness,
     Her evil behavior,
     And leaving, with meekness,
     Her sins to her Saviour!

 The vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos. The
      versification although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the
      fantastic, is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which is
      the thesis of the poem.

 Among the minor poems of Lord Byron is one which has never received from
      the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves:—

 Though the day of my destiny’s over,
         And the star of my fate bath declined
     Thy soft heart refused to discover
         The faults which so many could find;
     Though thy soul with my grief was acquainted,
         It shrunk not to share it with me,
     And the love which my spirit bath painted
         It never bath found but in thee. Then when nature around me is smiling,
         The last smile which answers to mine,
     I do not believe it beguiling,
         Because it reminds me of shine;
     And when winds are at war with the ocean,
         As the breasts I believed in with me,
     If their billows excite an emotion,
         It is that they bear me from thee. Though the rock of my last hope is shivered,
         And its fragments are sunk in the wave,
     Though I feel that my soul is delivered
         To pain—it shall not be its slave.
     There is many a pang to pursue me:
         They may crush, but they shall not contemn—
     They may torture, but shall not subdue me—
         ‘Tis of thee that I think—not of them.

     Though human, thou didst not deceive me,
         Though woman, thou didst not forsake,
     Though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,
         Though slandered, thou never couldst shake,—
     Though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,
         Though parted, it was not to fly,
     Though watchful, ‘twas not to defame me,
         Nor mute, that the world might belie.

     Yet I blame not the world, nor despise it,
         Nor the war of the many with one—
     If my soul was not fitted to prize it,
         ‘Twas folly not sooner to shun:
     And if dearly that error bath cost me,
         And more than I once could foresee,
     I have found that whatever it lost me,
         It could not deprive me of thee. From the wreck of the past, which bath perished,
         Thus much I at least may recall,
     It bath taught me that which I most cherished
         Deserved to be dearest of all:
     In the desert a fountain is springing,
         In the wide waste there still is a tree,
     And a bird in the solitude singing,
        Which speaks to my spirit of thee. 

 Although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult, the versification
      could scarcely be improved. No nobler theme ever engaged the pen of
      poet. It is the soul-elevating idea that no man can consider himself
      entitled to complain of Fate while in his adversity he still retains the
      unwavering love of woman.

 From Alfred Tennyson, although in perfect sincerity I regard him as the
      noblest poet that ever lived, I have left myself time to cite only a very
      brief specimen. I call him, and think him the noblest of poets, not because the impressions he produces are at all times the most
      profound— not because the poetical excitement which he induces
      is at all times the most intense—but because it is at all
      times the most ethereal—in other words, the most elevating and most
      pure. No poet is so little of the earth, earthy. What I am about to read
      is from his last long poem, “The Princess”:—

 Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,
     Tears from the depth of some divine despair
     Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,
     In looking on the happy Autumn fields,
     And thinking of the days that are no more.

         Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,
     That brings our friends up from the underworld,
     Sad as the last which reddens over one
     That sinks with all we love below the verge;
     So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.

         Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns
     The earliest pipe of half-awaken’d birds
     To dying ears, when unto dying eyes
     The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;
     So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.

         Dear as remember’d kisses after death,
     And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign’d
     On lips that are for others; deep as love,
     Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;
     O Death in Life, the days that are no more.

 Thus, although in a very cursory and imperfect manner, I have endeavored
      to convey to you my conception of the Poetic Principle. It has been my
      purpose to suggest that, while this principle itself is strictly and
      simply the Human Aspiration for Supernal Beauty, the manifestation of the
      Principle is always found in an elevating excitement of the soul, quite
      independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the Heart, or of
      that truth which is the satisfaction of the Reason. For in regard to
      passion, alas! its tendency is to degrade rather than to elevate the Soul.
      Love, on the contrary—Love—the true, the divine Eros—the
      Uranian as distinguished from the Diona an Venus—is unquestionably
      the purest and truest of all poetical themes. And in regard to Truth, if,
      to be sure, through the attainment of a truth we are led to perceive a
      harmony where none was apparent before, we experience at once the true
      poetical effect; but this effect is referable to the harmony alone, and
      not in the least degree to the truth which merely served to render the
      harmony manifest.

 We shall reach, however, more immediately a distinct conception of what
      the true Poetry is, by mere reference to a few of the simple elements
      which induce in the Poet himself the poetical effect He recognizes the
      ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in Heaven—in
      the volutes of the flower—in the clustering of low shrubberies—in
      the waving of the grain-fields—in the slanting of tall eastern trees—in
      the blue distance of mountains—in the grouping of clouds—in
      the twinkling of half-hidden brooks—in the gleaming of silver rivers—in
      the repose of sequestered lakes—in the star-mirroring depths of
      lonely wells. He perceives it in the songs of birds—in the harp of
      Bolos—in the sighing of the night-wind—in the repining voice
      of the forest—in the surf that complains to the shore—in the
      fresh breath of the woods—in the scent of the violet—in the
      voluptuous perfume of the hyacinth—in the suggestive odour that
      comes to him at eventide from far distant undiscovered islands, over dim
      oceans, illimitable and unexplored. He owns it in all noble thoughts—in
      all unworldly motives—in all holy impulses—in all chivalrous,
      generous, and self-sacrificing deeds. He feels it in the beauty of woman—in
      the grace of her step—in the lustre of her eye—in the melody
      of her voice—in her soft laughter, in her sigh—in the harmony
      of the rustling of her robes. He deeply feels it in her winning
      endearments—in her burning enthusiasms—in her gentle charities—in
      her meek and devotional endurances—but above all—ah, far above
      all, he kneels to it—he worships it in the faith, in the purity, in
      the strength, in the altogether divine majesty—of her love.

 Let me conclude by—the recitation of yet another brief poem—one
      very different in character from any that I have before quoted. It is by
      Motherwell, and is called “The Song of the Cavalier.” With our
      modern and altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of
      warfare, we are not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to
      sympathize with the sentiments, and thus to appreciate the real excellence
      of the poem. To do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the
      soul of the old cavalier:—

 Then mounte! then mounte, brave gallants all,
         And don your helmes amaine:
     Deathe’s couriers. Fame and Honor call
         No shrewish teares shall fill your eye
     When the sword-hilt’s in our hand,—
         Heart-whole we’ll part, and no whit sighe
     For the fayrest of the land;
         Let piping swaine, and craven wight,
     Thus weepe and poling crye,
         Our business is like men to fight.
