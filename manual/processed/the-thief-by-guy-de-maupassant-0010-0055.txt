THE THIEF

 While apparently thinking of something else, Dr. Sorbier had been
      listening quietly to those amazing accounts of burglaries and daring deeds
      that might have been taken from the trial of Cartouche. “Assuredly,”
      he exclaimed, “assuredly, I know of no viler fault nor any meaner
      action than to attack a girl's innocence, to corrupt her, to profit by a
      moment of unconscious weakness and of madness, when her heart is beating
      like that of a frightened fawn, and her pure lips seek those of her
      tempter; when she abandons herself without thinking of the irremediable
      stain, nor of her fall, nor of the morrow.

 “The man who has brought this about slowly, viciously, who can tell
      with what science of evil, and who, in such a case, has not steadiness and
      self-restraint enough to quench that flame by some icy words, who has not
      sense enough for two, who cannot recover his self-possession and master
      the runaway brute within him, and who loses his head on the edge of the
      precipice over which she is going to fall, is as contemptible as any man
      who breaks open a lock, or as any rascal on the lookout for a house left
      defenceless and unprotected or for some easy and dishonest stroke of
      business, or as that thief whose various exploits you have just related to
      us.

 “I, for my part, utterly refuse to absolve him, even when
      extenuating circumstances plead in his favor, even when he is carrying on
      a dangerous flirtation, in which a man tries in vain to keep his balance,
      not to exceed the limits of the game, any more than at lawn tennis; even
      when the parts are inverted and a man's adversary is some precocious,
      curious, seductive girl, who shows you immediately that she has nothing to
      learn and nothing to experience, except the last chapter of love, one of
      those girls from whom may fate always preserve our sons, and whom a
      psychological novel writer has christened 'The Semi-Virgins.'

 “It is, of course, difficult and painful for that coarse and
      unfathomable vanity which is characteristic of every man, and which might
      be called 'malism', not to stir such a charming fire, difficult to act the
      Joseph and the fool, to turn away his eyes, and, as it were, to put wax
      into his ears, like the companions of Ulysses when they were attracted by
      the divine, seductive songs of the Sirens, difficult only to touch that
      pretty table covered with a perfectly new cloth, at which you are invited
      to take a seat before any one else, in such a suggestive voice, and are
      requested to quench your thirst and to taste that new wine, whose fresh
      and strange flavor you will never forget. But who would hesitate to
      exercise such self-restraint if, when he rapidly examines his conscience,
      in one of those instinctive returns to his sober self in which a man
      thinks clearly and recovers his head, he were to measure the gravity of
      his fault, consider it, think of its consequences, of the reprisals, of
      the uneasiness which he would always feel in the future, and which would
      destroy the repose and happiness of his life?

 “You may guess that behind all these moral reflections, such as a
      graybeard like myself may indulge in, there is a story hidden, and, sad as
      it is, I am sure it will interest you on account of the strange heroism it
      shows.”

 He was silent for a few moments, as if to classify his recollections, and,
      with his elbows resting on the arms of his easy-chair and his eyes looking
      into space, he continued in the slow voice of a hospital professor who is
      explaining a case to his class of medical students, at a bedside:

 “He was one of those men who, as our grandfathers used to say, never
      met with a cruel woman, the type of the adventurous knight who was always
      foraging, who had something of the scamp about him, but who despised
      danger and was bold even to rashness. He was ardent in the pursuit of
      pleasure, and had an irresistible charm about him, one of those men in
      whom we excuse the greatest excesses as the most natural things in the
      world. He had run through all his money at gambling and with pretty girls,
      and so became, as it were, a soldier of fortune. He amused himself
      whenever and however he could, and was at that time quartered at
      Versailles.

 “I knew him to the very depths of his childlike heart, which was
      only too easily seen through and sounded, and I loved him as some old
      bachelor uncle loves a nephew who plays him tricks, but who knows how to
      coax him. He had made me his confidant rather than his adviser, kept me
      informed of his slightest pranks, though he always pretended to be
      speaking about one of his friends, and not about himself; and I must
      confess that his youthful impetuosity, his careless gaiety, and his
      amorous ardor sometimes distracted my thoughts and made me envy the
      handsome, vigorous young fellow who was so happy at being alive, that I
      had not the courage to check him, to show him the right road, and to call
      out to him: 'Take care!' as children do at blind man's buff.

 “And one day, after one of those interminable cotillons, where the
      couples do not leave each other for hours, and can disappear together
      without anybody thinking of noticing them, the poor fellow at last
      discovered what love was, that real love which takes up its abode in the
      very centre of the heart and in the brain, and is proud of being there,
      and which rules like a sovereign and a tyrannous master, and he became
      desperately enamored of a pretty but badly brought up girl, who was as
      disquieting and wayward as she was pretty.

 “She loved him, however, or rather she idolized him despotically,
      madly, with all her enraptured soul and all her being. Left to do as she
      pleased by imprudent and frivolous parents, suffering from neurosis, in
      consequence of the unwholesome friendships which she contracted at the
      convent school, instructed by what she saw and heard and knew was going on
      around her, in spite of her deceitful and artificial conduct, knowing that
      neither her father nor her mother, who were very proud of their race as
      well as avaricious, would ever agree to let her marry the man whom she had
      taken a liking to, that handsome fellow who had little besides vision,
      ideas and debts, and who belonged to the middle-class, she laid aside all
      scruples, thought of nothing but of becoming his, no matter what might be
      the cost.

 “By degrees, the unfortunate man's strength gave way, his heart
      softened, and he allowed himself to be carried away by that current which
      buffeted him, surrounded him, and left him on the shore like a waif and a
      stray.

 “They wrote letters full of madness to each other, and not a day
      passed without their meeting, either accidentally, as it seemed, or at
      parties and balls. She had yielded her lips to him in long, ardent
      caresses, which had sealed their compact of mutual passion.”

 The doctor stopped, and his eyes suddenly filled with tears, as these
      former troubles came back to his mind; and then, in a hoarse voice, he
      went on, full of the horror of what he was going to relate:

 “For months he scaled the garden wall, and, holding his breath and
      listening for the slightest noise, like a burglar who is going to break
      into a house, he went in by the servants' entrance, which she had left
      open, slunk barefoot down a long passage and up the broad staircase, which
      creaked occasionally, to the second story, where his sweetheart's room
      was, and stayed there for hours.

 “One night, when it was darker than usual, and he was hurrying lest
      he should be later than the time agreed on, he knocked up against a piece
      of furniture in the anteroom and upset it. It so happened that the girl's
      mother had not gone to sleep, either because she had a sick headache, or
      else because she had sat up late over some novel, and, frightened at that
      unusual noise which disturbed the silence of the house, she jumped out of
      bed, opened the door, saw some one indistinctly running away and keeping
      close to the wall, and, immediately thinking that there were burglars in
      the house, she aroused her husband and the servants by her frantic
      screams. The unfortunate man understood the situation; and, seeing what a
      terrible fix he was in, and preferring to be taken for a common thief to
      dishonoring his adored one's name, he ran into the drawing-room, felt on
      the tables and what-nots, filled his pockets at random with valuable
      bric-a-brac, and then cowered down behind the grand piano, which barred
      the corner of a large room.

 “The servants, who had run in with lighted candles, found him, and,
      overwhelming him with abuse, seized him by the collar and dragged him,
      panting and apparently half dead with shame and terror, to the nearest
      police station. He defended himself with intentional awkwardness when he
      was brought up for trial, kept up his part with the most perfect
      self-possession and without any signs of the despair and anguish that he
      felt in his heart, and, condemned and degraded and made to suffer
      martyrdom in his honor as a man and a soldier—he was an officer—he
      did not protest, but went to prison as one of those criminals whom society
      gets rid of like noxious vermin.

 “He died there of misery and of bitterness of spirit, with the name
      of the fair-haired idol, for whom he had sacrificed himself, on his lips,
      as if it had been an ecstatic prayer, and he intrusted his will 'to the
      priest who administered extreme unction to him, and requested him to give
      it to me. In it, without mentioning anybody, and without in the least
      lifting the veil, he at last explained the enigma, and cleared himself of
      those accusations the terrible burden of which he had borne until his last
      breath.

 “I have always thought myself, though I do not know why, that the
      girl married and had several charming children, whom she brought up with
      the austere strictness and in the serious piety of former days!”
