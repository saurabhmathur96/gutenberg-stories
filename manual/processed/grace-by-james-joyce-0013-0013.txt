GRACE

 Two gentlemen who were in the lavatory at the time tried to lift him up: but he
was quite helpless. He lay curled up at the foot of the stairs down which he
had fallen. They succeeded in turning him over. His hat had rolled a few yards
away and his clothes were smeared with the filth and ooze of the floor on which
he had lain, face downwards. His eyes were closed and he breathed with a
grunting noise. A thin stream of blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.

 These two gentlemen and one of the curates carried him up the stairs and laid
him down again on the floor of the bar. In two minutes he was surrounded by a
ring of men. The manager of the bar asked everyone who he was and who was with
him. No one knew who he was but one of the curates said he had served the
gentleman with a small rum.

 “Was he by himself?” asked the manager.

 “No, sir. There was two gentlemen with him.”

 “And where are they?”

 No one knew; a voice said:

 “Give him air. He’s fainted.”

 The ring of onlookers distended and closed again elastically. A dark medal of
blood had formed itself near the man’s head on the tessellated floor. The
manager, alarmed by the grey pallor of the man’s face, sent for a
policeman.

 His collar was unfastened and his necktie undone. He opened his eyes for an
instant, sighed and closed them again. One of gentlemen who had carried him
upstairs held a dinged silk hat in his hand. The manager asked repeatedly did
no one know who the injured man was or where had his friends gone. The door of
the bar opened and an immense constable entered. A crowd which had followed him
down the laneway collected outside the door, struggling to look in through the
glass panels.

 The manager at once began to narrate what he knew. The constable, a young man
with thick immobile features, listened. He moved his head slowly to right and
left and from the manager to the person on the floor, as if he feared to be the
victim of some delusion. Then he drew off his glove, produced a small book from
his waist, licked the lead of his pencil and made ready to indite. He asked in
a suspicious provincial accent:

 “Who is the man? What’s his name and address?”

 A young man in a cycling-suit cleared his way through the ring of bystanders.
He knelt down promptly beside the injured man and called for water. The
constable knelt down also to help. The young man washed the blood from the
injured man’s mouth and then called for some brandy. The constable
repeated the order in an authoritative voice until a curate came running with
the glass. The brandy was forced down the man’s throat. In a few seconds
he opened his eyes and looked about him. He looked at the circle of faces and
then, understanding, strove to rise to his feet.

 “You’re all right now?” asked the young man in the
cycling-suit.

 “Sha, ’s nothing,” said the injured man, trying to stand up.

 He was helped to his feet. The manager said something about a hospital and some
of the bystanders gave advice. The battered silk hat was placed on the
man’s head. The constable asked:

 “Where do you live?”

 The man, without answering, began to twirl the ends of his moustache. He made
light of his accident. It was nothing, he said: only a little accident. He
spoke very thickly.

 “Where do you live?” repeated the constable.

 The man said they were to get a cab for him. While the point was being debated
a tall agile gentleman of fair complexion, wearing a long yellow ulster, came
from the far end of the bar. Seeing the spectacle, he called out:

 “Hallo, Tom, old man! What’s the trouble?”

 “Sha, ’s nothing,” said the man.

 The new-comer surveyed the deplorable figure before him and then turned to the
constable, saying:

 “It’s all right, constable. I’ll see him home.”

 The constable touched his helmet and answered:

 “All right, Mr Power!”

 “Come now, Tom,” said Mr Power, taking his friend by the arm.
“No bones broken. What? Can you walk?”

 The young man in the cycling-suit took the man by the other arm and the crowd
divided.

 “How did you get yourself into this mess?” asked Mr Power.

 “The gentleman fell down the stairs,” said the young man.

 “I’ ’ery ’uch o’liged to you, sir,” said
the injured man.

 “Not at all.”

 “’ant we have a little...?”

 “Not now. Not now.”

 The three men left the bar and the crowd sifted through the doors into the
laneway. The manager brought the constable to the stairs to inspect the scene
of the accident. They agreed that the gentleman must have missed his footing.
The customers returned to the counter and a curate set about removing the
traces of blood from the floor.

 When they came out into Grafton Street, Mr Power whistled for an outsider. The
injured man said again as well as he could:

 “I’ ’ery ’uch o’liged to you, sir. I hope
we’ll ’eet again. ’y na’e is Kernan.”

 The shock and the incipient pain had partly sobered him.

 “Don’t mention it,” said the young man.

 They shook hands. Mr Kernan was hoisted on to the car and, while Mr Power was
giving directions to the carman, he expressed his gratitude to the young man
and regretted that they could not have a little drink together.

 “Another time,” said the young man.

 The car drove off towards Westmoreland Street. As it passed Ballast Office the
clock showed half-past nine. A keen east wind hit them, blowing from the mouth
of the river. Mr Kernan was huddled together with cold. His friend asked him to
tell how the accident had happened.

 “I ’an’t, ’an,” he answered, “’y
’ongue is hurt.”

 “Show.”

 The other leaned over the well of the car and peered into Mr Kernan’s
mouth but he could not see. He struck a match and, sheltering it in the shell
of his hands, peered again into the mouth which Mr Kernan opened obediently.
The swaying movement of the car brought the match to and from the opened mouth.
The lower teeth and gums were covered with clotted blood and a minute piece of
the tongue seemed to have been bitten off. The match was blown out.

 “That’s ugly,” said Mr Power.

 “Sha, ’s nothing,” said Mr Kernan, closing his mouth and
pulling the collar of his filthy coat across his neck.

 Mr Kernan was a commercial traveller of the old school which believed in the
dignity of its calling. He had never been seen in the city without a silk hat
of some decency and a pair of gaiters. By grace of these two articles of
clothing, he said, a man could always pass muster. He carried on the tradition
of his Napoleon, the great Blackwhite, whose memory he evoked at times by
legend and mimicry. Modern business methods had spared him only so far as to
allow him a little office in Crowe Street on the window blind of which was
written the name of his firm with the address—London, E.C. On the
mantelpiece of this little office a little leaden battalion of canisters was
drawn up and on the table before the window stood four or five china bowls
which were usually half full of a black liquid. From these bowls Mr Kernan
tasted tea. He took a mouthful, drew it up, saturated his palate with it and
then spat it forth into the grate. Then he paused to judge.

 Mr Power, a much younger man, was employed in the Royal Irish Constabulary
Office in Dublin Castle. The arc of his social rise intersected the arc of his
friend’s decline, but Mr Kernan’s decline was mitigated by the fact
that certain of those friends who had known him at his highest point of success
still esteemed him as a character. Mr Power was one of these friends. His
inexplicable debts were a byword in his circle; he was a debonair young man.

 The car halted before a small house on the Glasnevin road and Mr Kernan was
helped into the house. His wife put him to bed while Mr Power sat downstairs in
the kitchen asking the children where they went to school and what book they
were in. The children—two girls and a boy, conscious of their
father’s helplessness and of their mother’s absence, began some
horseplay with him. He was surprised at their manners and at their accents, and
his brow grew thoughtful. After a while Mrs Kernan entered the kitchen,
exclaiming:

 “Such a sight! O, he’ll do for himself one day and that’s the
holy alls of it. He’s been drinking since Friday.”

 Mr Power was careful to explain to her that he was not responsible, that he had
come on the scene by the merest accident. Mrs Kernan, remembering Mr
Power’s good offices during domestic quarrels, as well as many small, but
opportune loans, said:

 “O, you needn’t tell me that, Mr Power. I know you’re a
friend of his, not like some of the others he does be with. They’re all
right so long as he has money in his pocket to keep him out from his wife and
family. Nice friends! Who was he with tonight, I’d like to know?”

 Mr Power shook his head but said nothing.

 “I’m so sorry,” she continued, “that I’ve nothing
in the house to offer you. But if you wait a minute I’ll send round to
Fogarty’s at the corner.”

 Mr Power stood up.

 “We were waiting for him to come home with the money. He never seems to
think he has a home at all.”

 “O, now, Mrs Kernan,” said Mr Power, “we’ll make him
turn over a new leaf. I’ll talk to Martin. He’s the man.
We’ll come here one of these nights and talk it over.”

 She saw him to the door. The carman was stamping up and down the footpath, and
swinging his arms to warm himself.

 “It’s very kind of you to bring him home,” she said.

 “Not at all,” said Mr Power.

 He got up on the car. As it drove off he raised his hat to her gaily.

 “We’ll make a new man of him,” he said. “Good-night,
Mrs Kernan.”

  Mrs Kernan’s puzzled eyes watched the car till it was out of sight. Then
she withdrew them, went into the house and emptied her husband’s pockets.

 She was an active, practical woman of middle age. Not long before she had
celebrated her silver wedding and renewed her intimacy with her husband by
waltzing with him to Mr Power’s accompaniment. In her days of courtship
Mr Kernan had seemed to her a not ungallant figure: and she still hurried to
the chapel door whenever a wedding was reported and, seeing the bridal pair,
recalled with vivid pleasure how she had passed out of the Star of the Sea
Church in Sandymount, leaning on the arm of a jovial well-fed man, who was
dressed smartly in a frock-coat and lavender trousers and carried a silk hat
gracefully balanced upon his other arm. After three weeks she had found a
wife’s life irksome and, later on, when she was beginning to find it
unbearable, she had become a mother. The part of mother presented to her no
insuperable difficulties and for twenty-five years she had kept house shrewdly
for her husband. Her two eldest sons were launched. One was in a draper’s
shop in Glasgow and the other was clerk to a tea-merchant in Belfast. They were
good sons, wrote regularly and sometimes sent home money. The other children
were still at school.

 Mr Kernan sent a letter to his office next day and remained in bed. She made
beef-tea for him and scolded him roundly. She accepted his frequent
intemperance as part of the climate, healed him dutifully whenever he was sick
and always tried to make him eat a breakfast. There were worse husbands. He had
never been violent since the boys had grown up and she knew that he would walk
to the end of Thomas Street and back again to book even a small order.

 Two nights after his friends came to see him. She brought them up to his
bedroom, the air of which was impregnated with a personal odour, and gave them
chairs at the fire. Mr Kernan’s tongue, the occasional stinging pain of
which had made him somewhat irritable during the day, became more polite. He
sat propped up in the bed by pillows and the little colour in his puffy cheeks
made them resemble warm cinders. He apologised to his guests for the disorder
of the room, but at the same time looked at them a little proudly, with a
veteran’s pride.

 He was quite unconscious that he was the victim of a plot which his friends, Mr
Cunningham, Mr M’Coy and Mr Power had disclosed to Mrs Kernan in the
parlour. The idea had been Mr Power’s but its development was entrusted
to Mr Cunningham. Mr Kernan came of Protestant stock and, though he had been
converted to the Catholic faith at the time of his marriage, he had not been in
the pale of the Church for twenty years. He was fond, moreover, of giving
side-thrusts at Catholicism.

 Mr Cunningham was the very man for such a case. He was an elder colleague of Mr
Power. His own domestic life was not very happy. People had great sympathy with
him for it was known that he had married an unpresentable woman who was an
incurable drunkard. He had set up house for her six times; and each time she
had pawned the furniture on him.

 Everyone had respect for poor Martin Cunningham. He was a thoroughly sensible
man, influential and intelligent. His blade of human knowledge, natural
astuteness particularised by long association with cases in the police courts,
had been tempered by brief immersions in the waters of general philosophy. He
was well informed. His friends bowed to his opinions and considered that his
face was like Shakespeare’s.

 When the plot had been disclosed to her, Mrs Kernan had said:

 “I leave it all in your hands, Mr Cunningham.”

 After a quarter of a century of married life, she had very few illusions left.
Religion for her was a habit and she suspected that a man of her
husband’s age would not change greatly before death. She was tempted to
see a curious appropriateness in his accident and, but that she did not wish to
seem bloody-minded, she would have told the gentlemen that Mr Kernan’s
tongue would not suffer by being shortened. However, Mr Cunningham was a
capable man; and religion was religion. The scheme might do good and, at least,
it could do no harm. Her beliefs were not extravagant. She believed steadily in
the Sacred Heart as the most generally useful of all Catholic devotions and
approved of the sacraments. Her faith was bounded by her kitchen but, if she
was put to it, she could believe also in the banshee and in the Holy Ghost.

 The gentlemen began to talk of the accident. Mr Cunningham said that he had
once known a similar case. A man of seventy had bitten off a piece of his
tongue during an epileptic fit and the tongue had filled in again so that no
one could see a trace of the bite.

 “Well, I’m not seventy,” said the invalid.

 “God forbid,” said Mr Cunningham.

 “It doesn’t pain you now?” asked Mr M’Coy.

 Mr M’Coy had been at one time a tenor of some reputation. His wife, who
had been a soprano, still taught young children to play the piano at low terms.
His line of life had not been the shortest distance between two points and for
short periods he had been driven to live by his wits. He had been a clerk in
the Midland Railway, a canvasser for advertisements for The Irish Times and for The Freeman’s Journal , a town traveller for a coal firm on
commission, a private inquiry agent, a clerk in the office of the Sub-Sheriff
and he had recently become secretary to the City Coroner. His new office made
him professionally interested in Mr Kernan’s case.

 “Pain? Not much,” answered Mr Kernan. “But it’s so
sickening. I feel as if I wanted to retch off.”

 “That’s the boose,” said Mr Cunningham firmly.

 “No,” said Mr Kernan. “I think I caught a cold on the car.
There’s something keeps coming into my throat, phlegm
or——”

 “Mucus.” said Mr M’Coy.

 “It keeps coming like from down in my throat; sickening thing.”

 “Yes, yes,” said Mr M’Coy, “that’s the
thorax.”

 He looked at Mr Cunningham and Mr Power at the same time with an air of
challenge. Mr Cunningham nodded his head rapidly and Mr Power said:

 “Ah, well, all’s well that ends well.”

 “I’m very much obliged to you, old man,” said the invalid.

 Mr Power waved his hand.

 “Those other two fellows I was with——”

 “Who were you with?” asked Mr Cunningham.

 “A chap. I don’t know his name. Damn it now, what’s his name?
Little chap with sandy hair....”

 “And who else?”

 “Harford.”

 “Hm,” said Mr Cunningham.

 When Mr Cunningham made that remark, people were silent. It was known that the
speaker had secret sources of information. In this case the monosyllable had a
moral intention. Mr Harford sometimes formed one of a little detachment which
left the city shortly after noon on Sunday with the purpose of arriving as soon
as possible at some public-house on the outskirts of the city where its members
duly qualified themselves as bona fide travellers. But his
fellow-travellers had never consented to overlook his origin. He had begun life
as an obscure financier by lending small sums of money to workmen at usurious
interest. Later on he had become the partner of a very fat short gentleman, Mr
Goldberg, in the Liffey Loan Bank. Though he had never embraced more than the
Jewish ethical code his fellow-Catholics, whenever they had smarted in person
or by proxy under his exactions, spoke of him bitterly as an Irish Jew and an
illiterate and saw divine disapproval of usury made manifest through the person
of his idiot son. At other times they remembered his good points.

 “I wonder where did he go to,” said Mr Kernan.

 He wished the details of the incident to remain vague. He wished his friends to
think there had been some mistake, that Mr Harford and he had missed each
other. His friends, who knew quite well Mr Harford’s manners in drinking,
were silent. Mr Power said again:

 “All’s well that ends well.”

 Mr Kernan changed the subject at once.

 “That was a decent young chap, that medical fellow,” he said.
“Only for him——”

 “O, only for him,” said Mr Power, “it might have been a case
of seven days, without the option of a fine.”

 “Yes, yes,” said Mr Kernan, trying to remember. “I remember
now there was a policeman. Decent young fellow, he seemed. How did it happen at
all?”

 “It happened that you were peloothered, Tom,” said Mr Cunningham
gravely.

 “True bill,” said Mr Kernan, equally gravely.

 “I suppose you squared the constable, Jack,” said Mr M’Coy.

 Mr Power did not relish the use of his Christian name. He was not
straight-laced, but he could not forget that Mr M’Coy had recently made a
crusade in search of valises and portmanteaus to enable Mrs M’Coy to
fulfil imaginary engagements in the country. More than he resented the fact
that he had been victimised he resented such low playing of the game. He
answered the question, therefore, as if Mr Kernan had asked it.

 The narrative made Mr Kernan indignant. He was keenly conscious of his
citizenship, wished to live with his city on terms mutually honourable and
resented any affront put upon him by those whom he called country bumpkins.

 “Is this what we pay rates for?” he asked. “To feed and
clothe these ignorant bostooms ... and they’re nothing else.”

 Mr Cunningham laughed. He was a Castle official only during office hours.

 “How could they be anything else, Tom?” he said.

 He assumed a thick provincial accent and said in a tone of command:

 “65, catch your cabbage!”

 Everyone laughed. Mr M’Coy, who wanted to enter the conversation by any
door, pretended that he had never heard the story. Mr Cunningham said:

 “It is supposed—they say, you know—to take place in the depot
where they get these thundering big country fellows, omadhauns, you know, to
drill. The sergeant makes them stand in a row against the wall and hold up
their plates.”

 He illustrated the story by grotesque gestures.

 “At dinner, you know. Then he has a bloody big bowl of cabbage before him
on the table and a bloody big spoon like a shovel. He takes up a wad of cabbage
on the spoon and pegs it across the room and the poor devils have to try and
catch it on their plates: 65, catch your cabbage .”

 Everyone laughed again: but Mr Kernan was somewhat indignant still. He talked
of writing a letter to the papers.

 “These yahoos coming up here,” he said, “think they can boss
the people. I needn’t tell you, Martin, what kind of men they are.”

 Mr Cunningham gave a qualified assent.

 “It’s like everything else in this world,” he said.
“You get some bad ones and you get some good ones.”

 “O yes, you get some good ones, I admit,” said Mr Kernan,
satisfied.

 “It’s better to have nothing to say to them,” said Mr
M’Coy. “That’s my opinion!”

 Mrs Kernan entered the room and, placing a tray on the table, said:

 “Help yourselves, gentlemen.”

 Mr Power stood up to officiate, offering her his chair. She declined it, saying
she was ironing downstairs, and, after having exchanged a nod with Mr
Cunningham behind Mr Power’s back, prepared to leave the room. Her
husband called out to her:

 “And have you nothing for me, duckie?”

 “O, you! The back of my hand to you!” said Mrs Kernan tartly.

 Her husband called after her:

 “Nothing for poor little hubby!”

 He assumed such a comical face and voice that the distribution of the bottles
of stout took place amid general merriment.

 The gentlemen drank from their glasses, set the glasses again on the table and
paused. Then Mr Cunningham turned towards Mr Power and said casually:

 “On Thursday night, you said, Jack.”

 “Thursday, yes,” said Mr Power.

 “Righto!” said Mr Cunningham promptly.

 “We can meet in M’Auley’s,” said Mr M’Coy.
“That’ll be the most convenient place.”

 “But we mustn’t be late,” said Mr Power earnestly,
“because it is sure to be crammed to the doors.”

 “We can meet at half-seven,” said Mr M’Coy.

 “Righto!” said Mr Cunningham.

 “Half-seven at M’Auley’s be it!”

 There was a short silence. Mr Kernan waited to see whether he would be taken
into his friends’ confidence. Then he asked:

 “What’s in the wind?”

 “O, it’s nothing,” said Mr Cunningham. “It’s only
a little matter that we’re arranging about for Thursday.”

 “The opera, is it?” said Mr Kernan.

 “No, no,” said Mr Cunningham in an evasive tone, “it’s
just a little ... spiritual matter.”

 “O,” said Mr Kernan.

 There was silence again. Then Mr Power said, point blank:

 “To tell you the truth, Tom, we’re going to make a retreat.”

 “Yes, that’s it,” said Mr Cunningham, “Jack and I and
M’Coy here—we’re all going to wash the pot.”

 He uttered the metaphor with a certain homely energy and, encouraged by his own
voice, proceeded:

 “You see, we may as well all admit we’re a nice collection of
scoundrels, one and all. I say, one and all,” he added with gruff charity
and turning to Mr Power. “Own up now!”

 “I own up,” said Mr Power.

 “And I own up,” said Mr M’Coy.

 “So we’re going to wash the pot together,” said Mr
Cunningham.

 A thought seemed to strike him. He turned suddenly to the invalid and said:

 “D’ye know what, Tom, has just occurred to me? You might join in
and we’d have a four-handed reel.”

 “Good idea,” said Mr Power. “The four of us together.”

 Mr Kernan was silent. The proposal conveyed very little meaning to his mind
but, understanding that some spiritual agencies were about to concern
themselves on his behalf, he thought he owed it to his dignity to show a stiff
neck. He took no part in the conversation for a long while but listened, with
an air of calm enmity, while his friends discussed the Jesuits.

 “I haven’t such a bad opinion of the Jesuits,” he said,
intervening at length. “They’re an educated order. I believe they
mean well too.”

 “They’re the grandest order in the Church, Tom,” said Mr
Cunningham, with enthusiasm. “The General of the Jesuits stands next to
the Pope.”

 “There’s no mistake about it,” said Mr M’Coy, “if
you want a thing well done and no flies about it you go to a Jesuit.
They’re the boyos have influence. I’ll tell you a case in
point....”

 “The Jesuits are a fine body of men,” said Mr Power.

 “It’s a curious thing,” said Mr Cunningham, “about the
Jesuit Order. Every other order of the Church had to be reformed at some time
or other but the Jesuit Order was never once reformed. It never fell
away.”

 “Is that so?” asked Mr M’Coy.

 “That’s a fact,” said Mr Cunningham. “That’s
history.”

 “Look at their church, too,” said Mr Power. “Look at the
congregation they have.”

 “The Jesuits cater for the upper classes,” said Mr M’Coy.

 “Of course,” said Mr Power.

 “Yes,” said Mr Kernan. “That’s why I have a feeling for
them. It’s some of those secular priests, ignorant,
bumptious——”

 “They’re all good men,” said Mr Cunningham, “each in
his own way. The Irish priesthood is honoured all the world over.”

 “O yes,” said Mr Power.

 “Not like some of the other priesthoods on the continent,” said Mr
M’Coy, “unworthy of the name.”

 “Perhaps you’re right,” said Mr Kernan, relenting.

 “Of course I’m right,” said Mr Cunningham. “I
haven’t been in the world all this time and seen most sides of it without
being a judge of character.”

 The gentlemen drank again, one following another’s example. Mr Kernan
seemed to be weighing something in his mind. He was impressed. He had a high
opinion of Mr Cunningham as a judge of character and as a reader of faces. He
asked for particulars.

 “O, it’s just a retreat, you know,” said Mr Cunningham.
“Father Purdon is giving it. It’s for business men, you
know.”

 “He won’t be too hard on us, Tom,” said Mr Power
persuasively.

 “Father Purdon? Father Purdon?” said the invalid.

 “O, you must know him, Tom,” said Mr Cunningham stoutly.
“Fine jolly fellow! He’s a man of the world like ourselves.”

 “Ah, ... yes. I think I know him. Rather red face; tall.”

 “That’s the man.”

 “And tell me, Martin.... Is he a good preacher?”

 “Munno.... It’s not exactly a sermon, you know. It’s just
kind of a friendly talk, you know, in a common-sense way.”

 Mr Kernan deliberated. Mr M’Coy said:

 “Father Tom Burke, that was the boy!”

 “O, Father Tom Burke,” said Mr Cunningham, “that was a born
orator. Did you ever hear him, Tom?”

 “Did I ever hear him!” said the invalid, nettled. “Rather! I
heard him....”

 “And yet they say he wasn’t much of a theologian,” said Mr
Cunningham.

 “Is that so?” said Mr M’Coy.

 “O, of course, nothing wrong, you know. Only sometimes, they say, he
didn’t preach what was quite orthodox.”

 “Ah! ... he was a splendid man,” said Mr M’Coy.

 “I heard him once,” Mr Kernan continued. “I forget the
subject of his discourse now. Crofton and I were in the back of the ... pit,
you know ... the——”

 “The body,” said Mr Cunningham.

 “Yes, in the back near the door. I forget now what.... O yes, it was on
the Pope, the late Pope. I remember it well. Upon my word it was magnificent,
the style of the oratory. And his voice! God! hadn’t he a voice! The
Prisoner of the Vatican , he called him. I remember Crofton saying to me
when we came out——”

 “But he’s an Orangeman, Crofton, isn’t he?” said Mr
Power.

 “‘Course he is,” said Mr Kernan, “and a damned decent
Orangeman too. We went into Butler’s in Moore Street—faith, I was
genuinely moved, tell you the God’s truth—and I remember well his
very words. Kernan , he said, we worship at different altars , he
said, but our belief is the same . Struck me as very well put.”

 “There’s a good deal in that,” said Mr Power. “There
used always to be crowds of Protestants in the chapel where Father Tom was
preaching.”

 “There’s not much difference between us,” said Mr
M’Coy.

 “We both believe in——”

 He hesitated for a moment.

 “... in the Redeemer. Only they don’t believe in the Pope and in
the mother of God.”

 “But, of course,” said Mr Cunningham quietly and effectively,
“our religion is the religion, the old, original faith.”

 “Not a doubt of it,” said Mr Kernan warmly.

 Mrs Kernan came to the door of the bedroom and announced:

 “Here’s a visitor for you!”

 “Who is it?”

 “Mr Fogarty.”

 “O, come in! come in!”

 A pale oval face came forward into the light. The arch of its fair trailing
moustache was repeated in the fair eyebrows looped above pleasantly astonished
eyes. Mr Fogarty was a modest grocer. He had failed in business in a licensed
house in the city because his financial condition had constrained him to tie
himself to second-class distillers and brewers. He had opened a small shop on
Glasnevin Road where, he flattered himself, his manners would ingratiate him
with the housewives of the district. He bore himself with a certain grace,
complimented little children and spoke with a neat enunciation. He was not
without culture.

 Mr Fogarty brought a gift with him, a half-pint of special whisky. He inquired
politely for Mr Kernan, placed his gift on the table and sat down with the
company on equal terms. Mr Kernan appreciated the gift all the more since he
was aware that there was a small account for groceries unsettled between him
and Mr Fogarty. He said:

 “I wouldn’t doubt you, old man. Open that, Jack, will you?”

 Mr Power again officiated. Glasses were rinsed and five small measures of
whisky were poured out. This new influence enlivened the conversation. Mr
Fogarty, sitting on a small area of the chair, was specially interested.

 “Pope Leo XIII.,” said Mr Cunningham, “was one of the lights
of the age. His great idea, you know, was the union of the Latin and Greek
Churches. That was the aim of his life.”

 “I often heard he was one of the most intellectual men in Europe,”
said Mr Power. “I mean, apart from his being Pope.”

 “So he was,” said Mr Cunningham, “if not the most so.
His motto, you know, as Pope, was Lux upon Lux—Light upon
Light .”

 “No, no,” said Mr Fogarty eagerly. “I think you’re
wrong there. It was Lux in Tenebris , I think— Light in
Darkness .”

 “O yes,” said Mr M’Coy, “ Tenebrae .”

 “Allow me,” said Mr Cunningham positively, “it was Lux
upon Lux . And Pius IX. his predecessor’s motto was Crux upon
Crux —that is, Cross upon Cross —to show the difference
between their two pontificates.”

 The inference was allowed. Mr Cunningham continued.

 “Pope Leo, you know, was a great scholar and a poet.”

 “He had a strong face,” said Mr Kernan.

 “Yes,” said Mr Cunningham. “He wrote Latin poetry.”

 “Is that so?” said Mr Fogarty.

 Mr M’Coy tasted his whisky contentedly and shook his head with a double
intention, saying:

 “That’s no joke, I can tell you.”

 “We didn’t learn that, Tom,” said Mr Power, following Mr
M’Coy’s example, “when we went to the penny-a-week
school.”

 “There was many a good man went to the penny-a-week school with a sod of
turf under his oxter,” said Mr Kernan sententiously. “The old
system was the best: plain honest education. None of your modern
trumpery....”

 “Quite right,” said Mr Power.

 “No superfluities,” said Mr Fogarty.

 He enunciated the word and then drank gravely.

 “I remember reading,” said Mr Cunningham, “that one of Pope
Leo’s poems was on the invention of the photograph—in Latin, of
course.”

 “On the photograph!” exclaimed Mr Kernan.

 “Yes,” said Mr Cunningham.

 He also drank from his glass.

 “Well, you know,” said Mr M’Coy, “isn’t the
photograph wonderful when you come to think of it?”

 “O, of course,” said Mr Power, “great minds can see
things.”

 “As the poet says: Great minds are very near to madness ,”
said Mr Fogarty.

 Mr Kernan seemed to be troubled in mind. He made an effort to recall the
Protestant theology on some thorny points and in the end addressed Mr
Cunningham.

 “Tell me, Martin,” he said. “Weren’t some of the
popes—of course, not our present man, or his predecessor, but some of the
old popes—not exactly ... you know ... up to the knocker?”

 There was a silence. Mr Cunningham said:

 “O, of course, there were some bad lots.... But the astonishing thing is
this. Not one of them, not the biggest drunkard, not the most ... out-and-out
ruffian, not one of them ever preached ex cathedra a word of false
doctrine. Now isn’t that an astonishing thing?”

 “That is,” said Mr Kernan.

 “Yes, because when the Pope speaks ex cathedra ,” Mr Fogarty
explained, “he is infallible.”

 “Yes,” said Mr Cunningham.

 “O, I know about the infallibility of the Pope. I remember I was younger
then.... Or was it that——?”

 Mr Fogarty interrupted. He took up the bottle and helped the others to a little
more. Mr M’Coy, seeing that there was not enough to go round, pleaded
that he had not finished his first measure. The others accepted under protest.
The light music of whisky falling into glasses made an agreeable interlude.

 “What’s that you were saying, Tom?” asked Mr M’Coy.

 “Papal infallibility,” said Mr Cunningham, “that was the
greatest scene in the whole history of the Church.”

 “How was that, Martin?” asked Mr Power.

 Mr Cunningham held up two thick fingers.

 “In the sacred college, you know, of cardinals and archbishops and
bishops there were two men who held out against it while the others were all
for it. The whole conclave except these two was unanimous. No! They
wouldn’t have it!”

 “Ha!” said Mr M’Coy.

 “And they were a German cardinal by the name of Dolling ... or Dowling
... or——”

 “Dowling was no German, and that’s a sure five,” said Mr
Power, laughing.

 “Well, this great German cardinal, whatever his name was, was one; and
the other was John MacHale.”

 “What?” cried Mr Kernan. “Is it John of Tuam?”

 “Are you sure of that now?” asked Mr Fogarty dubiously. “I
thought it was some Italian or American.”

 “John of Tuam,” repeated Mr Cunningham, “was the man.”

 He drank and the other gentlemen followed his lead. Then he resumed:

 “There they were at it, all the cardinals and bishops and archbishops
from all the ends of the earth and these two fighting dog and devil until at
last the Pope himself stood up and declared infallibility a dogma of the Church ex cathedra . On the very moment John MacHale, who had been arguing and
arguing against it, stood up and shouted out with the voice of a lion:
‘ Credo! ’”

 “ I believe! ” said Mr Fogarty.

 “ Credo! ” said Mr Cunningham. “That showed the faith he
had. He submitted the moment the Pope spoke.”

 “And what about Dowling?” asked Mr M’Coy.

 “The German cardinal wouldn’t submit. He left the church.”

 Mr Cunningham’s words had built up the vast image of the church in the
minds of his hearers. His deep raucous voice had thrilled them as it uttered
the word of belief and submission. When Mrs Kernan came into the room drying
her hands she came into a solemn company. She did not disturb the silence, but
leaned over the rail at the foot of the bed.

 “I once saw John MacHale,” said Mr Kernan, “and I’ll
never forget it as long as I live.”

 He turned towards his wife to be confirmed.

 “I often told you that?”

 Mrs Kernan nodded.

 “It was at the unveiling of Sir John Gray’s statue. Edmund Dwyer
Gray was speaking, blathering away, and here was this old fellow,
crabbed-looking old chap, looking at him from under his bushy eyebrows.”

 Mr Kernan knitted his brows and, lowering his head like an angry bull, glared
at his wife.

 “God!” he exclaimed, resuming his natural face, “I never saw
such an eye in a man’s head. It was as much as to say: I have you
properly taped, my lad . He had an eye like a hawk.”

 “None of the Grays was any good,” said Mr Power.

 There was a pause again. Mr Power turned to Mrs Kernan and said with abrupt
joviality:

 “Well, Mrs Kernan, we’re going to make your man here a good holy
pious and God-fearing Roman Catholic.”

 He swept his arm round the company inclusively.

 “We’re all going to make a retreat together and confess our
sins—and God knows we want it badly.”

 “I don’t mind,” said Mr Kernan, smiling a little nervously.

 Mrs Kernan thought it would be wiser to conceal her satisfaction. So she said:

 “I pity the poor priest that has to listen to your tale.”

 Mr Kernan’s expression changed.

 “If he doesn’t like it,” he said bluntly, “he can ...
do the other thing. I’ll just tell him my little tale of woe. I’m
not such a bad fellow——”

 Mr Cunningham intervened promptly.

 “We’ll all renounce the devil,” he said, “together, not
forgetting his works and pomps.”

 “Get behind me, Satan!” said Mr Fogarty, laughing and looking at
the others.

 Mr Power said nothing. He felt completely out-generalled. But a pleased
expression flickered across his face.

 “All we have to do,” said Mr Cunningham, “is to stand up with
lighted candles in our hands and renew our baptismal vows.”

 “O, don’t forget the candle, Tom,” said Mr M’Coy,
“whatever you do.”

 “What?” said Mr Kernan. “Must I have a candle?”

 “O yes,” said Mr Cunningham.

 “No, damn it all,” said Mr Kernan sensibly, “I draw the line
there. I’ll do the job right enough. I’ll do the retreat business
and confession, and ... all that business. But ... no candles! No, damn it all,
I bar the candles!”

 He shook his head with farcical gravity.

 “Listen to that!” said his wife.

 “I bar the candles,” said Mr Kernan, conscious of having created an
effect on his audience and continuing to shake his head to and fro. “I
bar the magic-lantern business.”

 Everyone laughed heartily.

 “There’s a nice Catholic for you!” said his wife.

 “No candles!” repeated Mr Kernan obdurately. “That’s
off!”

  The transept of the Jesuit Church in Gardiner Street was almost full; and still
at every moment gentlemen entered from the side door and, directed by the
lay-brother, walked on tiptoe along the aisles until they found seating
accommodation. The gentlemen were all well dressed and orderly. The light of
the lamps of the church fell upon an assembly of black clothes and white
collars, relieved here and there by tweeds, on dark mottled pillars of green
marble and on lugubrious canvases. The gentlemen sat in the benches, having
hitched their trousers slightly above their knees and laid their hats in
security. They sat well back and gazed formally at the distant speck of red
light which was suspended before the high altar.

 In one of the benches near the pulpit sat Mr Cunningham and Mr Kernan. In the
bench behind sat Mr M’Coy alone: and in the bench behind him sat Mr Power
and Mr Fogarty. Mr M’Coy had tried unsuccessfully to find a place in the
bench with the others and, when the party had settled down in the form of a
quincunx, he had tried unsuccessfully to make comic remarks. As these had not
been well received he had desisted. Even he was sensible of the decorous
atmosphere and even he began to respond to the religious stimulus. In a whisper
Mr Cunningham drew Mr Kernan’s attention to Mr Harford, the moneylender,
who sat some distance off, and to Mr Fanning, the registration agent and mayor
maker of the city, who was sitting immediately under the pulpit beside one of
the newly elected councillors of the ward. To the right sat old Michael Grimes,
the owner of three pawnbroker’s shops, and Dan Hogan’s nephew, who
was up for the job in the Town Clerk’s office. Farther in front sat Mr
Hendrick, the chief reporter of The Freeman’s Journal , and poor
O’Carroll, an old friend of Mr Kernan’s, who had been at one time a
considerable commercial figure. Gradually, as he recognised familiar faces, Mr
Kernan began to feel more at home. His hat, which had been rehabilitated by his
wife, rested upon his knees. Once or twice he pulled down his cuffs with one
hand while he held the brim of his hat lightly, but firmly, with the other
hand.

 A powerful-looking figure, the upper part of which was draped with a white
surplice, was observed to be struggling into the pulpit. Simultaneously the
congregation unsettled, produced handkerchiefs and knelt upon them with care.
Mr Kernan followed the general example. The priest’s figure now stood
upright in the pulpit, two-thirds of its bulk, crowned by a massive red face,
appearing above the balustrade.

 Father Purdon knelt down, turned towards the red speck of light and, covering
his face with his hands, prayed. After an interval, he uncovered his face and
rose. The congregation rose also and settled again on its benches. Mr Kernan
restored his hat to its original position on his knee and presented an
attentive face to the preacher. The preacher turned back each wide sleeve of
his surplice with an elaborate large gesture and slowly surveyed the array of
faces. Then he said:

  



  “For the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the
children of light. Wherefore make unto yourselves friends out of the mammon of
iniquity so that when you die they may receive you into everlasting
dwellings.” 

  



 Father Purdon developed the text with resonant assurance. It was one of the
most difficult texts in all the Scriptures, he said, to interpret properly. It
was a text which might seem to the casual observer at variance with the lofty
morality elsewhere preached by Jesus Christ. But, he told his hearers, the text
had seemed to him specially adapted for the guidance of those whose lot it was
to lead the life of the world and who yet wished to lead that life not in the
manner of worldlings. It was a text for business men and professional men.
Jesus Christ, with His divine understanding of every cranny of our human
nature, understood that all men were not called to the religious life, that by
far the vast majority were forced to live in the world and, to a certain
extent, for the world: and in this sentence He designed to give them a word of
counsel, setting before them as exemplars in the religious life those very
worshippers of Mammon who were of all men the least solicitous in matters
religious.

 He told his hearers that he was there that evening for no terrifying, no
extravagant purpose; but as a man of the world speaking to his fellow-men. He
came to speak to business men and he would speak to them in a businesslike way.
If he might use the metaphor, he said, he was their spiritual accountant; and
he wished each and every one of his hearers to open his books, the books of his
spiritual life, and see if they tallied accurately with conscience.

 Jesus Christ was not a hard taskmaster. He understood our little failings,
understood the weakness of our poor fallen nature, understood the temptations
of this life. We might have had, we all had from time to time, our temptations:
we might have, we all had, our failings. But one thing only, he said, he would
ask of his hearers. And that was: to be straight and manly with God. If their
accounts tallied in every point to say:

 “Well, I have verified my accounts. I find all well.”

 But if, as might happen, there were some discrepancies, to admit the truth, to
be frank and say like a man:

 “Well, I have looked into my accounts. I find this wrong and this wrong.
But, with God’s grace, I will rectify this and this. I will set right my
accounts.”
