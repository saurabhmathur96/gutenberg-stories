‘ANNA ON THE NECK’

 I

  A

FTER the wedding
      they had not even light refreshments; the happy pair simply drank a glass
      of champagne, changed into their travelling things, and drove to the
      station. Instead of a gay wedding ball and supper, instead of music and
      dancing, they went on a journey to pray at a shrine a hundred and fifty
      miles away. Many people commended this, saying that Modest Alexeitch was a
      man high up in the service and no longer young, and that a noisy wedding
      might not have seemed quite suitable; and music is apt to sound dreary
      when a government official of fifty-two marries a girl who is only just
      eighteen. People said, too, that Modest Alexeitch, being a man of
      principle, had arranged this visit to the monastery expressly in order to
      make his young bride realize that even in marriage he put religion and
      morality above everything.

 The happy pair were seen off at the station. The crowd of relations and
      colleagues in the service stood, with glasses in their hands, waiting for
      the train to start to shout “Hurrah!” and the bride’s
      father, Pyotr Leontyitch, wearing a top-hat and the uniform of a teacher,
      already drunk and very pale, kept craning towards the window, glass in
      hand and saying in an imploring voice:

 “Anyuta! Anya, Anya! one word!”

 Anna bent out of the window to him, and he whispered something to her,
      enveloping her in a stale smell of alcohol, blew into her ear —she
      could make out nothing—and made the sign of the cross over her face,
      her bosom, and her hands; meanwhile he was breathing in gasps and tears
      were shining in his eyes. And the schoolboys, Anna’s brothers, Petya
      and Andrusha, pulled at his coat from behind, whispering in confusion:

 “Father, hush! . . . Father, that’s enough. . . .”

 When the train started, Anna saw her father run a little way after the
      train, staggering and spilling his wine, and what a kind, guilty, pitiful
      face he had:

 “Hurra—ah!” he shouted.

 The happy pair were left alone. Modest Alexeitch looked about the
      compartment, arranged their things on the shelves, and sat down, smiling,
      opposite his young wife. He was an official of medium height, rather stout
      and puffy, who looked exceedingly well nourished, with long whiskers and
      no moustache. His clean-shaven, round, sharply defined chin looked like
      the heel of a foot. The most characteristic point in his face was the
      absence of moustache, the bare, freshly shaven place, which gradually
      passed into the fat cheeks, quivering like jelly. His deportment was
      dignified, his movements were deliberate, his manner was soft.

 “I cannot help remembering now one circumstance,” he said,
      smiling. “When, five years ago, Kosorotov received the order of St.
      Anna of the second grade, and went to thank His Excellency, His Excellency
      expressed himself as follows: ‘So now you have three Annas: one in
      your buttonhole and two on your neck.’ And it must be explained that
      at that time Kosorotov’s wife, a quarrelsome and frivolous person,
      had just returned to him, and that her name was Anna. I trust that when I
      receive the Anna of the second grade His Excellency will not have occasion
      to say the same thing to me.”

 He smiled with his little eyes. And she, too, smiled, troubled at the
      thought that at any moment this man might kiss her with his thick damp
      lips, and that she had no right to prevent his doing so. The soft
      movements of his fat person frightened her; she felt both fear and
      disgust. He got up, without haste took off the order from his neck, took
      off his coat and waistcoat, and put on his dressing-gown.

 “That’s better,” he said, sitting down beside Anna.

 Anna remembered what agony the wedding had been, when it had seemed to her
      that the priest, and the guests, and every one in church had been looking
      at her sorrowfully and asking why, why was she, such a sweet, nice girl,
      marrying such an elderly, uninteresting gentleman. Only that morning she
      was delighted that everything had been satisfactorily arranged, but at the
      time of the wedding, and now in the railway carriage, she felt cheated,
      guilty, and ridiculous. Here she had married a rich man and yet she had no
      money, her wedding-dress had been bought on credit, and when her father
      and brothers had been saying good-bye, she could see from their faces that
      they had not a farthing. Would they have any supper that day? And
      tomorrow? And for some reason it seemed to her that her father and the
      boys were sitting tonight hungry without her, and feeling the same misery
      as they had the day after their mother’s funeral.

 “Oh, how unhappy I am!” she thought. “Why am I so
      unhappy?”

 With the awkwardness of a man with settled habits, unaccustomed to deal
      with women, Modest Alexeitch touched her on the waist and patted her on
      the shoulder, while she went on thinking about money, about her mother and
      her mother’s death. When her mother died, her father, Pyotr
      Leontyitch, a teacher of drawing and writing in the high school, had taken
      to drink, impoverishment had followed, the boys had not had boots or
      goloshes, their father had been hauled up before the magistrate, the
      warrant officer had come and made an inventory of the furniture. . . .
      What a disgrace! Anna had had to look after her drunken father, darn her
      brothers’ stockings, go to market, and when she was complimented on
      her youth, her beauty, and her elegant manners, it seemed to her that
      every one was looking at her cheap hat and the holes in her boots that
      were inked over. And at night there had been tears and a haunting dread
      that her father would soon, very soon, be dismissed from the school for
      his weakness, and that he would not survive it, but would die, too, like
      their mother. But ladies of their acquaintance had taken the matter in
      hand and looked about for a good match for Anna. This Modest Alexevitch,
      who was neither young nor good-looking but had money, was soon found. He
      had a hundred thousand in the bank and the family estate, which he had let
      on lease. He was a man of principle and stood well with His Excellency; it
      would be nothing to him, so they told Anna, to get a note from His
      Excellency to the directors of the high school, or even to the Education
      Commissioner, to prevent Pyotr Leontyitch from being dismissed.

 While she was recalling these details, she suddenly heard strains of music
      which floated in at the window, together with the sound of voices. The
      train was stopping at a station. In the crowd beyond the platform an
      accordion and a cheap squeaky fiddle were being briskly played, and the
      sound of a military band came from beyond the villas and the tall birches
      and poplars that lay bathed in the moonlight; there must have been a dance
      in the place. Summer visitors and townspeople, who used to come out here
      by train in fine weather for a breath of fresh air, were parading up and
      down on the platform. Among them was the wealthy owner of all the summer
      villas—a tall, stout, dark man called Artynov. He had prominent eyes
      and looked like an Armenian. He wore a strange costume; his shirt was
      unbuttoned, showing his chest; he wore high boots with spurs, and a black
      cloak hung from his shoulders and dragged on the ground like a train. Two
      boar-hounds followed him with their sharp noses to the ground.

 Tears were still shining in Anna’s eyes, but she was not thinking
      now of her mother, nor of money, nor of her marriage; but shaking hands
      with schoolboys and officers she knew, she laughed gaily and said quickly:

 “How do you do? How are you?”

 She went out on to the platform between the carriages into the moonlight,
      and stood so that they could all see her in her new splendid dress and
      hat.

 “Why are we stopping here?” she asked.

 “This is a junction. They are waiting for the mail train to pass.”

 Seeing that Artynov was looking at her, she screwed up her eyes
      coquettishly and began talking aloud in French; and because her voice
      sounded so pleasant, and because she heard music and the moon was
      reflected in the pond, and because Artynov, the notorious Don Juan and
      spoiled child of fortune, was looking at her eagerly and with curiosity,
      and because every one was in good spirits—she suddenly felt joyful,
      and when the train started and the officers of her acquaintance saluted
      her, she was humming the polka the strains of which reached her from the
      military band playing beyond the trees; and she returned to her
      compartment feeling as though it had been proved to her at the station
      that she would certainly be happy in spite of everything.

 The happy pair spent two days at the monastery, then went back to town.
      They lived in a rent-free flat. When Modest Alexevitch had gone to the
      office, Anna played the piano, or shed tears of depression, or lay down on
      a couch and read novels or looked through fashion papers. At dinner Modest
      Alexevitch ate a great deal and talked about politics, about appointments,
      transfers, and promotions in the service, about the necessity of hard
      work, and said that, family life not being a pleasure but a duty, if you
      took care of the kopecks the roubles would take care of themselves, and
      that he put religion and morality before everything else in the world. And
      holding his knife in his fist as though it were a sword, he would say:

 “Every one ought to have his duties!”

 And Anna listened to him, was frightened, and could not eat, and she
      usually got up from the table hungry. After dinner her husband lay down
      for a nap and snored loudly, while Anna went to see her own people. Her
      father and the boys looked at her in a peculiar way, as though just before
      she came in they had been blaming her for having married for money a
      tedious, wearisome man she did not love; her rustling skirts, her
      bracelets, and her general air of a married lady, offended them and made
      them uncomfortable. In her presence they felt a little embarrassed and did
      not know what to talk to her about; but yet they still loved her as
      before, and were not used to having dinner without her. She sat down with
      them to cabbage soup, porridge, and fried potatoes, smelling of mutton
      dripping. Pyotr Leontyitch filled his glass from the decanter with a
      trembling hand and drank it off hurriedly, greedily, with repulsion, then
      poured out a second glass and then a third. Petya and Andrusha, thin, pale
      boys with big eyes, would take the decanter and say desperately:

 “You mustn’t, father. . . . Enough, father. . . .”

 And Anna, too, was troubled and entreated him to drink no more; and he
      would suddenly fly into a rage and beat the table with his fists:

 “I won’t allow any one to dictate to me!” he would
      shout. “Wretched boys! wretched girl! I’ll turn you all out!”

 But there was a note of weakness, of good-nature in his voice, and no one
      was afraid of him. After dinner he usually dressed in his best. Pale, with
      a cut on his chin from shaving, craning his thin neck, he would stand for
      half an hour before the glass, prinking, combing his hair, twisting his
      black moustache, sprinkling himself with scent, tying his cravat in a bow;
      then he would put on his gloves and his top-hat, and go off to give his
      private lessons. Or if it was a holiday he would stay at home and paint,
      or play the harmonium, which wheezed and growled; he would try to wrest
      from it pure harmonious sounds and would sing to it; or would storm at the
      boys:

 “Wretches! Good-for-nothing boys! You have spoiled the instrument!”

 In the evening Anna’s husband played cards with his colleagues, who
      lived under the same roof in the government quarters. The wives of these
      gentlemen would come in—ugly, tastelessly dressed women, as coarse
      as cooks—and gossip would begin in the flat as tasteless and
      unattractive as the ladies themselves. Sometimes Modest Alexevitch would
      take Anna to the theatre. In the intervals he would never let her stir a
      step from his side, but walked about arm in arm with her through the
      corridors and the foyer. When he bowed to some one, he immediately
      whispered to Anna: “A civil councillor . . . visits at His
      Excellency’s”; or, “A man of means . . . has a house of
      his own.” When they passed the buffet Anna had a great longing for
      something sweet; she was fond of chocolate and apple cakes, but she had no
      money, and she did not like to ask her husband. He would take a pear,
      pinch it with his fingers, and ask uncertainly:

 “How much?”

 “Twenty-five kopecks!”

 “I say!” he would reply, and put it down; but as it was
      awkward to leave the buffet without buying anything, he would order some
      seltzer-water and drink the whole bottle himself, and tears would come
      into his eyes. And Anna hated him at such times.

 And suddenly flushing crimson, he would say to her rapidly:

 “Bow to that old lady!”

 “But I don’t know her.”

 “No matter. That’s the wife of the director of the local
      treasury! Bow, I tell you,” he would grumble insistently. “Your
      head won’t drop off.”

 Anna bowed and her head certainly did not drop off, but it was agonizing.
      She did everything her husband wanted her to, and was furious with herself
      for having let him deceive her like the veriest idiot. She had only
      married him for his money, and yet she had less money now than before her
      marriage. In old days her father would sometimes give her twenty kopecks,
      but now she had not a farthing.

 To take money by stealth or ask for it, she could not; she was afraid of
      her husband, she trembled before him. She felt as though she had been
      afraid of him for years. In her childhood the director of the high school
      had always seemed the most impressive and terrifying force in the world,
      sweeping down like a thunderstorm or a steam-engine ready to crush her;
      another similar force of which the whole family talked, and of which they
      were for some reason afraid, was His Excellency; then there were a dozen
      others, less formidable, and among them the teachers at the high school,
      with shaven upper lips, stern, implacable; and now finally, there was
      Modest Alexeitch, a man of principle, who even resembled the director in
      the face. And in Anna’s imagination all these forces blended
      together into one, and, in the form of a terrible, huge white bear,
      menaced the weak and erring such as her father. And she was afraid to say
      anything in opposition to her husband, and gave a forced smile, and tried
      to make a show of pleasure when she was coarsely caressed and defiled by
      embraces that excited her terror. Only once Pyotr Leontyitch had the
      temerity to ask for a loan of fifty roubles in order to pay some very
      irksome debt, but what an agony it had been!

 “Very good; I’ll give it to you,” said Modest Alexeitch
      after a moment’s thought; “but I warn you I won’t help
      you again till you give up drinking. Such a failing is disgraceful in a
      man in the government service! I must remind you of the well-known fact
      that many capable people have been ruined by that passion, though they
      might possibly, with temperance, have risen in time to a very high
      position.”

 And long-winded phrases followed: “inasmuch as . . .”, “following
      upon which proposition . . .”, “in view of the aforesaid
      contention . . .”; and Pyotr Leontyitch was in agonies of
      humiliation and felt an intense craving for alcohol.

 And when the boys came to visit Anna, generally in broken boots and
      threadbare trousers, they, too, had to listen to sermons.

 “Every man ought to have his duties!” Modest Alexeitch would
      say to them.

 And he did not give them money. But he did give Anna bracelets, rings, and
      brooches, saying that these things would come in useful for a rainy day.
      And he often unlocked her drawer and made an inspection to see whether
      they were all safe.

 II

  M

eanwhile winter
      came on. Long before Christmas there was an announcement in the local
      papers that the usual winter ball would take place on the twenty-ninth of
      December in the Hall of Nobility. Every evening after cards Modest
      Alexeitch was excitedly whispering with his colleagues’ wives and
      glancing at Anna, and then paced up and down the room for a long while,
      thinking. At last, late one evening, he stood still, facing Anna, and
      said:

 “You ought to get yourself a ball dress. Do you understand? Only
      please consult Marya Grigoryevna and Natalya Kuzminishna.”

 And he gave her a hundred roubles. She took the money, but she did not
      consult any one when she ordered the ball dress; she spoke to no one but
      her father, and tried to imagine how her mother would have dressed for a
      ball. Her mother had always dressed in the latest fashion and had always
      taken trouble over Anna, dressing her elegantly like a doll, and had
      taught her to speak French and dance the mazurka superbly (she had been a
      governess for five years before her marriage). Like her mother, Anna could
      make a new dress out of an old one, clean gloves with benzine, hire
      jewels; and, like her mother, she knew how to screw up her eyes, lisp,
      assume graceful attitudes, fly into raptures when necessary, and throw a
      mournful and enigmatic look into her eyes. And from her father she had
      inherited the dark colour of her hair and eyes, her highly-strung nerves,
      and the habit of always making herself look her best.

 When, half an hour before setting off for the ball, Modest Alexeitch went
      into her room without his coat on, to put his order round his neck before
      her pier-glass, dazzled by her beauty and the splendour of her fresh,
      ethereal dress, he combed his whiskers complacently and said:

 “So that’s what my wife can look like . . . so that’s
      what you can look like! Anyuta!” he went on, dropping into a tone of
      solemnity, “I have made your fortune, and now I beg you to do
      something for mine. I beg you to get introduced to the wife of His
      Excellency! For God’s sake, do! Through her I may get the post of
      senior reporting clerk!”

 They went to the ball. They reached the Hall of Nobility, the entrance
      with the hall porter. They came to the vestibule with the hat-stands, the
      fur coats; footmen scurrying about, and ladies with low necks putting up
      their fans to screen themselves from the draughts. There was a smell of
      gas and of soldiers. When Anna, walking upstairs on her husband’s
      arm, heard the music and saw herself full length in the looking-glass in
      the full glow of the lights, there was a rush of joy in her heart, and she
      felt the same presentiment of happiness as in the moonlight at the
      station. She walked in proudly, confidently, for the first time feeling
      herself not a girl but a lady, and unconsciously imitating her mother in
      her walk and in her manner. And for the first time in her life she felt
      rich and free. Even her husband’s presence did not oppress her, for
      as she crossed the threshold of the hall she had guessed instinctively
      that the proximity of an old husband did not detract from her in the
      least, but, on the contrary, gave her that shade of piquant mystery that
      is so attractive to men. The orchestra was already playing and the dances
      had begun. After their flat Anna was overwhelmed by the lights, the bright
      colours, the music, the noise, and looking round the room, thought,
      “Oh, how lovely!” She at once distinguished in the crowd all
      her acquaintances, every one she had met before at parties or on picnics—all
      the officers, the teachers, the lawyers, the officials, the landowners,
      His Excellency, Artynov, and the ladies of the highest standing, dressed
      up and very décollettées , handsome and ugly, who had already taken
      up their positions in the stalls and pavilions of the charity bazaar, to
      begin selling things for the benefit of the poor. A huge officer in
      epaulettes—she had been introduced to him in Staro-Kievsky Street
      when she was a schoolgirl, but now she could not remember his name—seemed
      to spring from out of the ground, begging her for a waltz, and she flew
      away from her husband, feeling as though she were floating away in a
      sailing-boat in a violent storm, while her husband was left far away on
      the shore. She danced passionately, with fervour, a waltz, then a polka
      and a quadrille, being snatched by one partner as soon as she was left by
      another, dizzy with music and the noise, mixing Russian with French,
      lisping, laughing, and with no thought of her husband or anything else.
      She excited great admiration among the men—that was evident, and
      indeed it could not have been otherwise; she was breathless with
      excitement, felt thirsty, and convulsively clutched her fan. Pyotr
      Leontyitch, her father, in a crumpled dress-coat that smelt of benzine,
      came up to her, offering her a plate of pink ice.

 “You are enchanting this evening,” he said, looking at her
      rapturously, “and I have never so much regretted that you were in
      such a hurry to get married. . . . What was it for? I know you did it for
      our sake, but . . .” With a shaking hand he drew out a roll of notes
      and said: “I got the money for my lessons today, and can pay your
      husband what I owe him.”

 She put the plate back into his hand, and was pounced upon by some one and
      borne off to a distance. She caught a glimpse over her partner’s
      shoulder of her father gliding over the floor, putting his arm round a
      lady and whirling down the ball-room with her.

 “How sweet he is when he is sober!” she thought.

 She danced the mazurka with the same huge officer; he moved gravely, as
      heavily as a dead carcase in a uniform, twitched his shoulders and his
      chest, stamped his feet very languidly—he felt fearfully disinclined
      to dance. She fluttered round him, provoking him by her beauty, her bare
      neck; her eyes glowed defiantly, her movements were passionate, while he
      became more and more indifferent, and held out his hands to her as
      graciously as a king.

 “Bravo, bravo!” said people watching them.

 But little by little the huge officer, too, broke out; he grew lively,
      excited, and, overcome by her fascination, was carried away and danced
      lightly, youthfully, while she merely moved her shoulders and looked slyly
      at him as though she were now the queen and he were her slave; and at that
      moment it seemed to her that the whole room was looking at them, and that
      everybody was thrilled and envied them. The huge officer had hardly had
      time to thank her for the dance, when the crowd suddenly parted and the
      men drew themselves up in a strange way, with their hands at their sides.

 His Excellency, with two stars on his dress-coat, was walking up to her.
      Yes, His Excellency was walking straight towards her, for he was staring
      directly at her with a sugary smile, while he licked his lips as he always
      did when he saw a pretty woman.

 “Delighted, delighted . . .” he began. “I shall order
      your husband to be clapped in a lock-up for keeping such a treasure hidden
      from us till now. I’ve come to you with a message from my wife,”
      he went on, offering her his arm. “You must help us. . . . M-m-yes.
      . . . We ought to give you the prize for beauty as they do in America . .
      . . M-m-yes. . . . The Americans. . . . My wife is expecting you
      impatiently.”

 He led her to a stall and presented her to a middle-aged lady, the lower
      part of whose face was disproportionately large, so that she looked as
      though she were holding a big stone in her mouth.

 “You must help us,” she said through her nose in a sing-song
      voice. “All the pretty women are working for our charity bazaar, and
      you are the only one enjoying yourself. Why won’t you help us?”

 She went away, and Anna took her place by the cups and the silver samovar.
      She was soon doing a lively trade. Anna asked no less than a rouble for a
      cup of tea, and made the huge officer drink three cups. Artynov, the rich
      man with prominent eyes, who suffered from asthma, came up, too; he was
      not dressed in the strange costume in which Anna had seen him in the
      summer at the station, but wore a dress-coat like every one else. Keeping
      his eyes fixed on Anna, he drank a glass of champagne and paid a hundred
      roubles for it, then drank some tea and gave another hundred—all
      this without saying a word, as he was short of breath through asthma. . .
      . Anna invited purchasers and got money out of them, firmly convinced by
      now that her smiles and glances could not fail to afford these people
      great pleasure. She realized now that she was created exclusively for this
      noisy, brilliant, laughing life, with its music, its dancers, its adorers,
      and her old terror of a force that was sweeping down upon her and menacing
      to crush her seemed to her ridiculous: she was afraid of no one now, and
      only regretted that her mother could not be there to rejoice at her
      success.

 Pyotr Leontyitch, pale by now but still steady on his legs, came up to the
      stall and asked for a glass of brandy. Anna turned crimson, expecting him
      to say something inappropriate (she was already ashamed of having such a
      poor and ordinary father); but he emptied his glass, took ten roubles out
      of his roll of notes, flung it down, and walked away with dignity without
      uttering a word. A little later she saw him dancing in the grand chain,
      and by now he was staggering and kept shouting something, to the great
      confusion of his partner; and Anna remembered how at the ball three years
      before he had staggered and shouted in the same way, and it had ended in
      the police-sergeant’s taking him home to bed, and next day the
      director had threatened to dismiss him from his post. How inappropriate
      that memory was!

 When the samovars were put out in the stalls and the exhausted ladies
      handed over their takings to the middle-aged lady with the stone in her
      mouth, Artynov took Anna on his arm to the hall where supper was served to
      all who had assisted at the bazaar. There were some twenty people at
      supper, not more, but it was very noisy. His Excellency proposed a toast:

 “In this magnificent dining-room it will be appropriate to drink to
      the success of the cheap dining-rooms, which are the object of today’s
      bazaar.”

 The brigadier-general proposed the toast: “To the power by which
      even the artillery is vanquished,” and all the company cClinked
      glasses with the ladies. It was very, very gay.

 When Anna was escorted home it was daylight and the cooks were going to
      market. Joyful, intoxicated, full of new sensations, exhausted, she
      undressed, dropped into bed, and at once fell asleep. . . .

 It was past one in the afternoon when the servant waked her and announced
      that M. Artynov had called. She dressed quickly and went down into the
      drawing-room. Soon after Artynov, His Excellency called to thank her for
      her assistance in the bazaar. With a sugary smile, chewing his lips, he
      kissed her hand, and asking her permission to come again, took his leave,
      while she remained standing in the middle of the drawing-room, amazed,
      enchanted, unable to believe that this change in her life, this marvellous
      change, had taken place so quickly; and at that moment Modest Alexeitch
      walked in . . . and he, too, stood before her now with the same
      ingratiating, sugary, cringingly respectful expression which she was
      accustomed to see on his face in the presence of the great and powerful;
      and with rapture, with indignation, with contempt, convinced that no harm
      would come to her from it, she said, articulating distinctly each word:

 “Be off, you blockhead!”

 From this time forward Anna never had one day free, as she was always
      taking part in picnics, expeditions, performances. She returned home every
      day after midnight, and went to bed on the floor in the drawing-room, and
      afterwards used to tell every one, touchingly, how she slept under
      flowers. She needed a very great deal of money, but she was no longer
      afraid of Modest Alexeitch, and spent his money as though it were her own;
      and she did not ask, did not demand it, simply sent him in the bills.
      “Give bearer two hundred roubles,” or “Pay one hundred
      roubles at once.”

 At Easter Modest Alexeitch received the Anna of the second grade. When he
      went to offer his thanks, His Excellency put aside the paper he was
      reading and settled himself more comfortably in his chair.

 “So now you have three Annas,” he said, scrutinizing his white
      hands and pink nails—“one on your buttonhole and two on your
      neck.”

 Modest Alexeitch put two fingers to his lips as a precaution against
      laughing too loud and said:

 “Now I have only to look forward to the arrival of a little
      Vladimir. I make bold to beg your Excellency to stand godfather.”

 He was alluding to Vladimir of the fourth grade, and was already imagining
      how he would tell everywhere the story of this pun, so happy in its
      readiness and audacity, and he wanted to say something equally happy, but
      His Excellency was buried again in his newspaper, and merely gave him a
      nod.

 And Anna went on driving about with three horses, going out hunting with
      Artynov, playing in one-act dramas, going out to supper, and was more and
      more rarely with her own family; they dined now alone. Pyotr Leontyitch
      was drinking more heavily than ever; there was no money, and the harmonium
      had been sold long ago for debt. The boys did not let him go out alone in
      the street now, but looked after him for fear he might fall down; and
      whenever they met Anna driving in Staro-Kievsky Street with a pair of
      horses and Artynov on the box instead of a coachman, Pyotr Leontyitch took
      off his top-hat, and was about to shout to her, but Petya and Andrusha
      took him by the arm, and said imploringly:

 “You mustn’t, father. Hush, father!”
