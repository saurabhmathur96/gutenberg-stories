OYSTERS

  I

NEED no great
      effort of memory to recall, in every detail, the rainy autumn evening when
      I stood with my father in one of the more frequented streets of Moscow,
      and felt that I was gradually being overcome by a strange illness. I had
      no pain at all, but my legs were giving way under me, the words stuck in
      my throat, my head slipped weakly on one side . . . It seemed as though,
      in a moment, I must fall down and lose consciousness.

 If I had been taken into a hospital at that minute, the doctors would have
      had to write over my bed: Fames , a disease which is not in the
      manuals of medicine.

 Beside me on the pavement stood my father in a shabby summer overcoat and
      a serge cap, from which a bit of white wadding was sticking out. On his
      feet he had big heavy goloshes. Afraid, vain man, that people would see
      that his feet were bare under his goloshes, he had drawn the tops of some
      old boots up round the calves of his legs.

 This poor, foolish, queer creature, whom I loved the more warmly the more
      ragged and dirty his smart summer overcoat became, had come to Moscow,
      five months before, to look for a job as copying-clerk. For those five
      months he had been trudging about Moscow looking for work, and it was only
      on that day that he had brought himself to go into the street to beg for
      alms.

 Before us was a big house of three storeys, adorned with a blue signboard
      with the word “Restaurant” on it. My head was drooping feebly
      backwards and on one side, and I could not help looking upwards at the
      lighted windows of the restaurant. Human figures were flitting about at
      the windows. I could see the right side of the orchestrion, two
      oleographs, hanging lamps . . . . Staring into one window, I saw a patch
      of white. The patch was motionless, and its rectangular outlines stood out
      sharply against the dark, brown background. I looked intently and made out
      of the patch a white placard on the wall. Something was written on it, but
      what it was, I could not see. . .

 For half an hour I kept my eyes on the placard. Its white attracted my
      eyes, and, as it were, hypnotised my brain. I tried to read it, but my
      efforts were in vain.

 At last the strange disease got the upper hand.

 The rumble of the carriages began to seem like thunder, in the stench of
      the street I distinguished a thousand smells. The restaurant lights and
      the lamps dazzled my eyes like lightning. My five senses were overstrained
      and sensitive beyond the normal. I began to see what I had not seen
      before.

 “Oysters . . .” I made out on the placard.

 A strange word! I had lived in the world eight years and three months, but
      had never come across that word. What did it mean? Surely it was not the
      name of the restaurant-keeper? But signboards with names on them always
      hang outside, not on the walls indoors!

 “Papa, what does ‘oysters’ mean?” I asked in a
      husky voice, making an effort to turn my face towards my father.

 My father did not hear. He was keeping a watch on the movements of the
      crowd, and following every passer-by with his eyes. . . . From his eyes I
      saw that he wanted to say something to the passers-by, but the fatal word
      hung like a heavy weight on his trembling lips and could not be flung off.
      He even took a step after one passer-by and touched him on the sleeve, but
      when he turned round, he said, “I beg your pardon,” was
      overcome with confusion, and staggered back.

 “Papa, what does ‘oysters’ mean?” I repeated.

 “It is an animal . . . that lives in the sea.”

 I instantly pictured to myself this unknown marine animal. . . . I thought
      it must be something midway between a fish and a crab. As it was from the
      sea they made of it, of course, a very nice hot fish soup with savoury
      pepper and laurel leaves, or broth with vinegar and fricassee of fish and
      cabbage, or crayfish sauce, or served it cold with horse-radish. . . . I
      vividly imagined it being brought from the market, quickly cleaned,
      quickly put in the pot, quickly, quickly, for everyone was hungry . . .
      awfully hungry! From the kitchen rose the smell of hot fish and crayfish
      soup.

 I felt that this smell was tickling my palate and nostrils, that it was
      gradually taking possession of my whole body. . . . The restaurant, my
      father, the white placard, my sleeves were all smelling of it, smelling so
      strongly that I began to chew. I moved my jaws and swallowed as though I
      really had a piece of this marine animal in my mouth . . .

 My legs gave way from the blissful sensation I was feeling, and I clutched
      at my father’s arm to keep myself from falling, and leant against
      his wet summer overcoat. My father was trembling and shivering. He was
      cold . . .

 “Papa, are oysters a Lenten dish?” I asked.

 “They are eaten alive . . .” said my father. “They are
      in shells like tortoises, but . . . in two halves.”

 The delicious smell instantly left off affecting me, and the illusion
      vanished. . . . Now I understood it all!

 “How nasty,” I whispered, “how nasty!”

 So that’s what “oysters” meant! I imagined to myself a
      creature like a frog. A frog sitting in a shell, peeping out from it with
      big, glittering eyes, and moving its revolting jaws. I imagined this
      creature in a shell with claws, glittering eyes, and a slimy skin, being
      brought from the market. . . . The children would all hide while the cook,
      frowning with an air of disgust, would take the creature by its claw, put
      it on a plate, and carry it into the dining-room. The grown-ups would take
      it and eat it, eat it alive with its eyes, its teeth, its legs! While it
      squeaked and tried to bite their lips. . . .

 I frowned, but . . . but why did my teeth move as though I were munching?
      The creature was loathsome, disgusting, terrible, but I ate it, ate it
      greedily, afraid of distinguishing its taste or smell. As soon as I had
      eaten one, I saw the glittering eyes of a second, a third . . . I ate them
      too. . . . At last I ate the table-napkin, the plate, my father’s
      goloshes, the white placard . . . I ate everything that caught my eye,
      because I felt that nothing but eating would take away my illness. The
      oysters had a terrible look in their eyes and were loathsome. I shuddered
      at the thought of them, but I wanted to eat! To eat!

 “Oysters! Give me some oysters!” was the cry that broke from
      me and I stretched out my hand.

 “Help us, gentlemen!” I heard at that moment my father say, in
      a hollow and shaking voice. “I am ashamed to ask but—my God!—I
      can bear no more!”

 “Oysters!” I cried, pulling my father by the skirts of his
      coat.

 “Do you mean to say you eat oysters? A little chap like you!”
      I heard laughter close to me.

 Two gentlemen in top hats were standing before us, looking into my face
      and laughing.

 “Do you really eat oysters, youngster? That’s interesting! How
      do you eat them?”

 I remember that a strong hand dragged me into the lighted restaurant. A
      minute later there was a crowd round me, watching me with curiosity and
      amusement. I sat at a table and ate something slimy, salt with a flavour
      of dampness and mouldiness. I ate greedily without chewing, without
      looking and trying to discover what I was eating. I fancied that if I
      opened my eyes I should see glittering eyes, claws, and sharp teeth.

 All at once I began biting something hard, there was a sound of a
      scrunching.

 “Ha, ha! He is eating the shells,” laughed the crowd. “Little
      silly, do you suppose you can eat that?”

 After that I remember a terrible thirst. I was lying in my bed, and could
      not sleep for heartburn and the strange taste in my parched mouth. My
      father was walking up and down, gesticulating with his hands.

 “I believe I have caught cold,” he was muttering. “I’ve
      a feeling in my head as though someone were sitting on it. . . . Perhaps
      it is because I have not . . . er . . . eaten anything to-day. . . . I
      really am a queer, stupid creature. . . . I saw those gentlemen pay ten
      roubles for the oysters. Why didn’t I go up to them and ask them . .
      . to lend me something? They would have given something.”

 Towards morning, I fell asleep and dreamt of a frog sitting in a shell,
      moving its eyes. At midday I was awakened by thirst, and looked for my
      father: he was still walking up and down and gesticulating.
