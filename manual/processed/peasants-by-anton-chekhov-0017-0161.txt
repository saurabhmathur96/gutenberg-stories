PEASANTS

 I

 N

IKOLAY TCHIKILDYEEV, a waiter in the Moscow hotel, Slavyansky Bazaar, was
taken ill. His legs went numb and his gait was affected, so that on one
occasion, as he was going along the corridor, he tumbled and fell down
with a tray full of ham and peas. He had to leave his job. All his own
savings and his wife’s were spent on doctors and medicines; they had
nothing left to live upon. He felt dull with no work to do, and he made up
his mind he must go home to the village. It is better to be ill at home,
and living there is cheaper; and it is a true saying that the walls of
home are a help.

 He reached Zhukovo towards evening. In his memories of childhood he had
pictured his home as bright, snug, comfortable. Now, going into the hut,
he was positively frightened; it was so dark, so crowded, so unclean. His
wife Olga and his daughter Sasha, who had come with him, kept looking in
bewilderment at the big untidy stove, which filled up almost half the hut
and was black with soot and flies. What lots of flies! The stove was on
one side, the beams lay slanting on the walls, and it looked as though the
hut were just going to fall to pieces. In the corner, facing the door,
under the holy images, bottle labels and newspaper cuttings were stuck on
the walls instead of pictures. The poverty, the poverty! Of the grown-up
people there were none at home; all were at work at the harvest. On the
stove was sitting a white-headed girl of eight, unwashed and apathetic;
she did not even glance at them as they came in. On the floor a white cat
was rubbing itself against the oven fork.

 “Puss, puss!” Sasha called to her. “Puss!”

 “She can’t hear,” said the little girl; “she has gone deaf.”

 “How is that?”

 “Oh, she was beaten.”

 Nikolay and Olga realized from the firs t glance what life was like here,
but said nothing to one another; in silence they put down their bundles,
and went out into the village street. Their hut was the third from the
end, and seemed the very poorest and oldest-looking; the second was not
much better; but the last one had an iron roof, and curtains in the
windows. That hut stood apart, not enclosed; it was a tavern. The huts
were in a single row, and the whole of the little village—quiet and
dreamy, with willows, elders, and mountain-ash trees peeping out from the
yards—had an attractive look.

 Beyond the peasants homesteads there was a slope down to the river, so
steep and precipitous that huge stones jutted out bare here and there
through the clay. Down the slope, among the stones and holes dug by the
potters, ran winding paths; bits of broken pottery, some brown, some red,
lay piled up in heaps, and below there stretched a broad, level, bright
green meadow, from which the hay had been already carried, and in which
the peasants’ cattle were wandering. The river, three-quarters of a mile
from the village, ran twisting and turning, with beautiful leafy banks;
beyond it was again a broad meadow, a herd of cattle, long strings of
white geese; then, just as on the near side, a steep ascent uphill, and on
the top of the hill a hamlet, and a church with five domes, and at a
little distance the manor-house.

 “It’s lovely here in your parts!” said Olga, crossing herself at the sight
of the church. “What space, oh Lord!”

 Just at that moment the bell began ringing for service (it was Saturday
evening). Two little girls, down below, who were dragging up a pail of
water, looked round at the church to listen to the bell.

 “At this time they are serving the dinners at the Slavyansky Bazaar,” said
Nikolay dreamily.

 Sitting on the edge of the slope, Nikolay and Olga watched the sun
setting, watched the gold and crimson sky reflected in the river, in the
church windows, and in the whole air—which was soft and still and
unutterably pure as it never was in Moscow. And when the sun had set the
flocks and herds passed, bleating and lowing; geese flew across from the
further side of the river, and all sank into silence; the soft light died
away in the air, and the dusk of evening began quickly moving down upon
them.

 Meanwhile Nikolay’s father and mother, two gaunt, bent, toothless old
people, just of the same height, came back. The women—the
sisters-in-law Marya and Fyokla—who had been working on the
landowner’s estate beyond the river, arrived home, too. Marya, the wife of
Nikolay’s brother Kiryak, had six children, and Fyokla, the wife of
Nikolay’s brother Denis—who had gone for a soldier—had two;
and when Nikolay, going into the hut, saw all the family, all those bodies
big and little moving about on the lockers, in the hanging cradles and in
all the corners, and when he saw the greed with which the old father and
the women ate the black bread, dipping it in water, he realized he had
made a mistake in coming here, sick, penniless, and with a family, too—a
great mistake!

 “And where is Kiryak?” he asked after they had exchanged greetings.

 “He is in service at the merchant’s,” answered his father; “a keeper in
the woods. He is not a bad peasant, but too fond of his glass.”

 “He is no great help!” said the old woman tearfully. “Our men are a
grievous lot; they bring nothing into the house, but take plenty out.
Kiryak drinks, and so does the old man; it is no use hiding a sin; he
knows his way to the tavern. The Heavenly Mother is wroth.”

 In honour of the visitors they brought out the samovar. The tea smelt of
fish; the sugar was grey and looked as though it had been nibbled;
cockroaches ran to and fro over the bread and among the crockery. It was
disgusting to drink, and the conversation was disgusting, too—about
nothing but poverty and illnesses. But before they had time to empty their
first cups there came a loud, prolonged, drunken shout from the yard:

 “Ma-arya!”

 “It looks as though Kiryak were coming,” said the old man. “Speak of the
devil.”

 All were hushed. And again, soon afterwards, the same shout, coarse and
drawn-out as though it came out of the earth:

 “Ma-arya!”

 Marya, the elder sister-in-law, turned pale and huddled against the stove,
and it was strange to see the look of terror on the face of the strong,
broad-shouldered, ugly woman. Her daughter, the child who had been sitting
on the stove and looked so apathetic, suddenly broke into loud weeping.

 “What are you howling for, you plague?” Fyokla, a handsome woman, also
strong and broad-shouldered, shouted to her. “He won’t kill you, no fear!”

 From his old father Nikolay learned that Marya was afraid to live in the
forest with Kiryak, and that when he was drunk he always came for her,
made a row, and beat her mercilessly.

 “Ma-arya!” the shout sounded close to the door.

 “Protect me, for Christ’s sake, good people!” faltered Marya, breathing as
though she had been plunged into very cold water. “Protect me, kind
people....”

 All the children in the hut began crying, and looking at them, Sasha, too,
began to cry. They heard a drunken cough, and a tall, black-bearded
peasant wearing a winter cap came into the hut, and was the more terrible
because his face could not be seen in the dim light of the little lamp. It
was Kiryak. Going up to his wife, he swung his arm and punched her in the
face with his fist. Stunned by the blow, she did not utter a sound, but
sat down, and her nose instantly began bleeding.

 “What a disgrace! What a disgrace!” muttered the old man, clambering up on
to the stove. “Before visitors, too! It’s a sin!”

 The old mother sat silent, bowed, lost in thought; Fyokla rocked the
cradle.

 Evidently conscious of inspiring fear, and pleased at doing so, Kiryak
seized Marya by the arm, dragged her towards the door, and bellowed like
an animal in order to seem still more terrible; but at that moment he
suddenly caught sight of the visitors and stopped.

 “Oh, they have come,...” he said, letting his wife go; “my own brother and
his family....”

 Staggering and opening wide his red, drunken eyes, he said his prayer
before the image and went on:

 “My brother and his family have come to the parental home... from Moscow,
I suppose. The great capital Moscow, to be sure, the mother of cities....
Excuse me.”

 He sank down on the bench near the samovar and began drinking tea, sipping
it loudly from the saucer in the midst of general silence.... He drank off
a dozen cups, then reclined on the bench and began snoring.

 They began going to bed. Nikolay, as an invalid, was put on the stove with
his old father; Sasha lay down on the floor, while Olga went with the
other women into the barn.

 “Aye, aye, dearie,” she said, lying down on the hay beside Marya; “you
won’t mend your trouble with tears. Bear it in patience, that is all. It
is written in the Scriptures: ‘If anyone smite thee on the right cheek,
offer him the left one also.’... Aye, aye, dearie.”

 Then in a low singsong murmur she told them about Moscow, about her own
life, how she had been a servant in furnished lodgings.

 “And in Moscow the houses are big, built of brick,” she said; “and there
are ever so many churches, forty times forty, dearie; and they are all
gentry in the houses, so handsome and so proper!”

 Marya told her that she had not only never been in Moscow, but had not
even been in their own district town; she could not read or write, and
knew no prayers, not even “Our Father.” Both she and Fyokla, the other
sister-in-law, who was sitting a little way off listening, were extremely
ignorant and could understand nothing. They both disliked their husbands;
Marya was afraid of Kiryak, and whenever he stayed with her she was
shaking with fear, and always got a headache from the fumes of vodka and
tobacco with which he reeked. And in answer to the question whether she
did not miss her husband, Fyokla answered with vexation:

 “Miss him!”

 They talked a little and sank into silence.

 It was cool, and a cock crowed at the top of his voice near the barn,
preventing them from sleeping. When the bluish morning light was already
peeping through all the crevices, Fyokla got up stealthily and went out,
and then they heard the sound of her bare feet running off somewhere.

 II

 Olga went to church, and took Marya with her. As they went down the path
towards the meadow both were in good spirits. Olga liked the wide view,
and Marya felt that in her sister-in-law she had someone near and akin to
her. The sun was rising. Low down over the meadow floated a drowsy hawk.
The river looked gloomy; there was a haze hovering over it here and there,
but on the further bank a streak of light already stretched across the
hill. The church was gleaming, and in the manor garden the rooks were
cawing furiously.

 “The old man is all right,” Marya told her, “but Granny is strict; she is
continually nagging. Our own grain lasted till Carnival. We buy flour now
at the tavern. She is angry about it; she says we eat too much.”

 “Aye, aye, dearie! Bear it in patience, that is all. It is written: ‘Come
unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden.’”

 Olga spoke sedately, rhythmically, and she walked like a pilgrim woman,
with a rapid, anxious step. Every day she read the gospel, read it aloud
like a deacon; a great deal of it she did not understand, but the words of
the gospel moved her to tears, and words like “forasmuch as” and “verily”
she pronounced with a sweet flutter at her heart. She believed in God, in
the Holy Mother, in the Saints; she believed one must not offend anyone in
the world—not simple folks, nor Germans, nor gypsies, nor Jews—and
woe even to those who have no compassion on the beasts. She believed this
was written in the Holy Scriptures; and so, when she pronounced phrases
from Holy Writ, even though she did not understand them, her face grew
softened, compassionate, and radiant.

 “What part do you come from?” Marya asked her.

 “I am from Vladimir. Only I was taken to Moscow long ago, when I was eight
years old.”

 They reached the river. On the further side a woman was standing at the
water’s edge, undressing.

 “It’s our Fyokla,” said Marya, recognizing her. “She has been over the
river to the manor yard. To the stewards. She is a shameless hussy and
foul-mouthed—fearfully!”

 Fyokla, young and vigorous as a girl, with her black eyebrows and her
loose hair, jumped off the bank and began splashing the water with her
feet, and waves ran in all directions from her.

 “Shameless—dreadfully!” repeated Marya.

 The river was crossed by a rickety little bridge of logs, and exactly
below it in the clear, limpid water was a shoal of broad-headed mullets.
The dew was glistening on the green bushes that looked into the water.
There was a feeling of warmth; it was comforting! What a lovely morning!
And how lovely life would have been in this world, in all likelihood, if
it were not for poverty, horrible, hopeless poverty, from which one can
find no refuge! One had only to look round at the village to remember
vividly all that had happened the day before, and the illusion of
happiness which seemed to surround them vanished instantly.

 They reached the church. Marya stood at the entrance, and did not dare to
go farther. She did not dare to sit down either. Though they only began
ringing for mass between eight and nine, she remained standing the whole
time.

 While the gospel was being read the crowd suddenly parted to make way for
the family from the great house. Two young girls in white frocks and
wide-brimmed hats walked in; with them a chubby, rosy boy in a sailor
suit. Their appearance touched Olga; she made up her mind from the first
glance that they were refined, well-educated, handsome people. Marya
looked at them from under her brows, sullenly, dejectedly, as though they
were not human beings coming in, but monsters who might crush her if she
did not make way for them.

 And every time the deacon boomed out something in his bass voice she
fancied she heard “Ma-arya!” and she shuddered.

 III

 The arrival of the visitors was already known in the village, and directly
after mass a number of people gathered together in the hut. The
Leonytchevs and Matvyeitchevs and the Ilyitchovs came to inquire about
their relations who were in service in Moscow. All the lads of Zhukovo who
could read and write were packed off to Moscow and hired out as butlers or
waiters (while from the village on the other side of the river the boys
all became bakers), and that had been the custom from the days of serfdom
long ago when a certain Luka Ivanitch, a peasant from Zhukovo, now a
legendary figure, who had been a waiter in one of the Moscow clubs, would
take none but his fellow-villagers into his service, and found jobs for
them in taverns and restaurants; and from that time the village of Zhukovo
was always called among the inhabitants of the surrounding districts
Slaveytown. Nikolay had been taken to Moscow when he was eleven, and Ivan
Makaritch, one of the Matvyeitchevs, at that time a headwaiter in the
“Hermitage” garden, had put him into a situation. And now, addressing the
Matvyeitchevs, Nikolay said emphatically:

 “Ivan Makaritch was my benefactor, and I am bound to pray for him day and
night, as it is owing to him I have become a good man.”

 “My good soul!” a tall old woman, the sister of Ivan Makaritch, said
tearfully, “and not a word have we heard about him, poor dear.”

 “In the winter he was in service at Omon’s, and this season there was a
rumour he was somewhere out of town, in gardens.... He has aged! In old
days he would bring home as much as ten roubles a day in the summer-time,
but now things are very quiet everywhere. The old man frets.”

 The women looked at Nikolay’s feet, shod in felt boots, and at his pale
face, and said mournfully:

 “You are not one to get on, Nikolay Osipitch; you are not one to get on!
No, indeed!”

 And they all made much of Sasha. She was ten years old, but she was little
and very thin, and might have been taken for no more than seven. Among the
other little girls, with their sunburnt faces and roughly cropped hair,
dressed in long faded smocks, she with her white little face, with her big
dark eyes, with a red ribbon in her hair, looked funny, as though she were
some little wild creature that had been caught and brought into the hut.

 “She can read, too,” Olga said in her praise, looking tenderly at her
daughter. “Read a little, child!” she said, taking the gospel from the
corner. “You read, and the good Christian people will listen.”

 The testament was an old and heavy one in leather binding, with
dog’s-eared edges, and it exhaled a smell as though monks had come into
the hut. Sasha raised her eyebrows and began in a loud rhythmic chant:

 “‘And the angel of the Lord... appeared unto Joseph, saying unto him: Rise
up, and take the Babe and His mother.’”

 “The Babe and His mother,” Olga repeated, and flushed all over with
emotion.

 “‘And flee into Egypt,... and tarry there until such time as...’”

 At the word “tarry” Olga could not refrain from tears. Looking at her,
Marya began to whimper, and after her Ivan Makaritch’s sister. The old
father cleared his throat, and bustled about to find something to give his
grand-daughter, but, finding nothing, gave it up with a wave of his hand.
And when the reading was over the neighbours dispersed to their homes,
feeling touched and very much pleased with Olga and Sasha.

 As it was a holiday, the family spent the whole day at home. The old
woman, whom her husband, her daughters-in-law, her grandchildren all alike
called Granny, tried to do everything herself; she heated the stove and
set the samovar with her own hands, even waited at the midday meal, and
then complained that she was worn out with work. And all the time she was
uneasy for fear someone should eat a piece too much, or that her husband
and daughters-in-law would sit idle. At one time she would hear the
tavern-keeper’s geese going at the back of the huts to her kitchen-garden,
and she would run out of the hut with a long stick and spend half an hour
screaming shrilly by her cabbages, which were as gaunt and scraggy as
herself; at another time she fancied that a crow had designs on her
chickens, and she rushed to attack it with loud words of abuse. She was
cross and grumbling from morning till night. And often she raised such an
outcry that passers-by stopped in the street.

 She was not affectionate towards the old man, reviling him as a lazy-bones
and a plague. He was not a responsible, reliable peasant, and perhaps if
she had not been continually nagging at him he would not have worked at
all, but would have simply sat on the stove and talked. He talked to his
son at great length about certain enemies of his, complained of the
insults he said he had to put up with every day from the neighbours, and
it was tedious to listen to him.

 “Yes,” he would say, standing with his arms akimbo, “yes.... A week after
the Exaltation of the Cross I sold my hay willingly at thirty kopecks a
pood.... Well and good.... So you see I was taking the hay in the morning
with a good will; I was interfering with no one. In an unlucky hour I see
the village elder, Antip Syedelnikov, coming out of the tavern. ‘Where are
you taking it, you ruffian?’ says he, and takes me by the ear.”

 Kiryak had a fearful headache after his drinking bout, and was ashamed to
face his brother.

 “What vodka does! Ah, my God!” he muttered, shaking his aching head. “For
Christ’s sake, forgive me, brother and sister; I’m not happy myself.”

 As it was a holiday, they bought a herring at the tavern and made a soup
of the herring’s head. At midday they all sat down to drink tea, and went
on drinking it for a long time, till they were all perspiring; they looked
positively swollen from the tea-drinking, and after it began sipping the
broth from the herring’s head, all helping themselves out of one bowl. But
the herring itself Granny had hidden.

 In the evening a potter began firing pots on the ravine. In the meadow
below the girls got up a choral dance and sang songs. They played the
concertina. And on the other side of the river a kiln for baking pots was
lighted, too, and the girls sang songs, and in the distance the singing
sounded soft and musical. The peasants were noisy in and about the tavern.
They were singing with drunken voices, each on his own account, and
swearing at one another, so that Olga could only shudder and say:

 “Oh, holy Saints!”

 She was amazed that the abuse was incessant, and those who were loudest
and most persistent in this foul language were the old men who were so
near their end. And the girls and children heard the swearing, and were
not in the least disturbed by it, and it was evident that they were used
to it from their cradles.

 It was past midnight, the kilns on both sides of the river were put out,
but in the meadow below and in the tavern the merrymaking still went on.
The old father and Kiryak, both drunk, walking arm-in-arm and jostling
against each other’s shoulders, went to the barn where Olga and Marya were
lying.

 “Let her alone,” the old man persuaded him; “let her alone.... She is a
harmless woman.... It’s a sin....”

 “Ma-arya!” shouted Kiryak.

 “Let her be.... It’s a sin.... She is not a bad woman.”

 Both stopped by the barn and went on.

 “I lo-ove the flowers of the fi-ield,” the old man began singing suddenly
in a high, piercing tenor. “I lo-ove to gather them in the meadows!”

 Then he spat, and with a filthy oath went into the hut.

 IV

 Granny put Sasha by her kitchen-garden and told her to keep watch that the
geese did not go in. It was a hot August day. The tavernkeeper’s geese
could make their way into the kitchen-garden by the backs of the huts, but
now they were busily engaged picking up oats by the tavern, peacefully
conversing together, and only the gander craned his head high as though
trying to see whether the old woman were coming with her stick. The other
geese might come up from below, but they were now grazing far away the
other side of the river, stretched out in a long white garland about the
meadow. Sasha stood about a little, grew weary, and, seeing that the geese
were not coming, went away to the ravine.

 There she saw Marya’s eldest daughter Motka, who was standing motionless
on a big stone, staring at the church. Marya had given birth to thirteen
children, but she only had six living, all girls, not one boy, and the
eldest was eight. Motka in a long smock was standing barefooted in the
full sunshine; the sun was blazing down right on her head, but she did not
notice that, and seemed as though turned to stone. Sasha stood beside her
and said, looking at the church:

 “God lives in the church. Men have lamps and candles, but God has little
green and red and blue lamps like little eyes. At night God walks about
the church, and with Him the Holy Mother of God and Saint Nikolay, thud,
thud, thud!... And the watchman is terrified, terrified! Aye, aye,
dearie,” she added, imitating her mother. “And when the end of the world
comes all the churches will be carried up to heaven.”

 “With the-ir be-ells?” Motka asked in her deep voice, drawling every
syllable.

 “With their bells. And when the end of the world comes the good will go to
Paradise, but the angry will burn in fire eternal and unquenchable,
dearie. To my mother as well as to Marya God will say: ‘You never offended
anyone, and for that go to the right to Paradise’; but to Kiryak and
Granny He will say: ‘You go to the left into the fire.’ And anyone who has
eaten meat in Lent will go into the fire, too.”

 She looked upwards at the sky, opening wide her eyes, and said:

 “Look at the sky without winking, you will see angels.”

 Motka began looking at the sky, too, and a minute passed in silence.

 “Do you see them?” asked Sasha.

 “I don’t,” said Motka in her deep voice.

 “But I do. Little angels are flying about the sky and flap, flap with
their little wings as though they were gnats.”

 Motka thought for a little, with her eyes on the ground, and asked:

 “Will Granny burn?”

 “She will, dearie.”

 From the stone an even gentle slope ran down to the bottom, covered with
soft green grass, which one longed to lie down on or to touch with one’s
hands... Sasha lay down and rolled to the bottom. Motka with a grave,
severe face, taking a deep breath, lay down, too, and rolled to the
bottom, and in doing so tore her smock from the hem to the shoulder.

 “What fun it is!” said Sasha, delighted.

 They walked up to the top to roll down again, but at that moment they
heard a shrill, familiar voice. Oh, how awful it was! Granny, a toothless,
bony, hunchbacked figure, with short grey hair which was fluttering in the
wind, was driving the geese out of the kitchen-garden with a long stick,
shouting.

 “They have trampled all the cabbages, the damned brutes! I’d cut your
throats, thrice accursed plagues! Bad luck to you!”

 She saw the little girls, flung down the stick and picked up a switch,
and, seizing Sasha by the neck with her fingers, thin and hard as the
gnarled branches of a tree, began whipping her. Sasha cried with pain and
terror, while the gander, waddling and stretching his neck, went up to the
old woman and hissed at her, and when he went back to his flock all the
geese greeted him approvingly with “Ga-ga-ga!” Then Granny proceeded to
whip Motka, and in this Motka’s smock was torn again. Feeling in despair,
and crying loudly, Sasha went to the hut to complain. Motka followed her;
she, too, was crying on a deeper note, without wiping her tears, and her
face was as wet as though it had been dipped in water.

 “Holy Saints!” cried Olga, aghast, as the two came into the hut. “Queen of
Heaven!”

 Sasha began telling her story, while at the same time Granny walked in
with a storm of shrill cries and abuse; then Fyokla flew into a rage, and
there was an uproar in the hut.

 “Never mind, never mind!” Olga, pale and upset, tried to comfort them,
stroking Sasha’s head. “She is your grandmother; it’s a sin to be angry
with her. Never mind, my child.”

 Nikolay, who was worn out already by the everlasting hubbub, hunger,
stifling fumes, filth, who hated and despised the poverty, who was ashamed
for his wife and daughter to see his father and mother, swung his legs off
the stove and said in an irritable, tearful voice, addressing his mother:

 “You must not beat her! You have no right to beat her!”

 “You lie rotting on the stove, you wretched creature!” Fyokla shouted at
him spitefully. “The devil brought you all on us, eating us out of house
and home.”

 Sasha and Motka and all the little girls in the hut huddled on the stove
in the corner behind Nikolay’s back, and from that refuge listened in
silent terror, and the beating of their little hearts could be distinctly
heard. Whenever there is someone in a family who has long been ill, and
hopelessly ill, there come painful moments when all timidly, secretly, at
the bottom of their hearts long for his death; and only the children fear
the death of someone near them, and always feel horrified at the thought
of it. And now the children, with bated breath, with a mournful look on
their faces, gazed at Nikolay and thought that he was soon to die; and
they wanted to cry and to say something friendly and compassionate to him.

 He pressed close to Olga, as though seeking protection, and said to her
softly in a quavering voice:

 “Olya darling, I can’t stay here longer. It’s more than I can bear. For
God’s sake, for Christ’s sake, write to your sister Klavdia Abramovna. Let
her sell and pawn everything she has; let her send us the money. We will
go away from here. Oh, Lord,” he went on miserably, “to have one peep at
Moscow! If I could see it in my dreams, the dear place!”

 And when the evening came on, and it was dark in the hut, it was so dismal
that it was hard to utter a word. Granny, very ill-tempered, soaked some
crusts of rye bread in a cup, and was a long time, a whole hour, sucking
at them. Marya, after milking the cow, brought in a pail of milk and set
it on a bench; then Granny poured it from the pail into a jug just as
slowly and deliberately, evidently pleased that it was now the Fast of the
Assumption, so that no one would drink milk and it would be left
untouched. And she only poured out a very little in a saucer for Fyokla’s
baby. When Marya and she carried the jug down to the cellar Motka suddenly
stirred, clambered down from the stove, and going to the bench where stood
the wooden cup full of crusts, sprinkled into it some milk from the
saucer.

 Granny, coming back into the hut, sat down to her soaked crusts again,
while Sasha and Motka, sitting on the stove, gazed at her, and they were
glad that she had broken her fast and now would go to hell. They were
comforted and lay down to sleep, and Sasha as she dozed off to sleep
imagined the Day of Judgment: a huge fire was burning, somewhat like a
potter’s kiln, and the Evil One, with horns like a cow’s, and black all
over, was driving Granny into the fire with a long stick, just as Granny
herself had been driving the geese.

 V

 On the day of the Feast of the Assumption, between ten and eleven in the
evening, the girls and lads who were merrymaking in the meadow suddenly
raised a clamour and outcry, and ran in the direction of the village; and
those who were above on the edge of the ravine could not for the first
moment make out what was the matter.

 “Fire! Fire!” they heard desperate shouts from below. “The village is on
fire!”

 Those who were sitting above looked round, and a terrible and
extraordinary spectacle met their eyes. On the thatched roof of one of the
end cottages stood a column of flame, seven feet high, which curled round
and scattered sparks in all directions as though it were a fountain. And
all at once the whole roof burst into bright flame, and the crackling of
the fire was audible.

 The light of the moon was dimmed, and the whole village was by now bathed
in a red quivering glow: black shadows moved over the ground, there was a
smell of burning, and those who ran up from below were all gasping and
could not speak for trembling; they jostled against each other, fell down,
and they could hardly see in the unaccustomed light, and did not recognize
each other. It was terrible. What seemed particularly dreadful was that
doves were flying over the fire in the smoke; and in the tavern, where
they did not yet know of the fire, they were still singing and playing the
concertina as though there were nothing the matter.

 “Uncle Semyon’s on fire,” shouted a loud, coarse voice.

 Marya was fussing about round her hut, weeping and wringing her hands,
while her teeth chattered, though the fire was a long way off at the other
end of the village. Nikolay came out in high felt boots, the children ran
out in their little smocks. Near the village constable’s hut an iron sheet
was struck. Boom, boom, boom!... floated through the air, and this
repeated, persistent sound sent a pang to the heart and turned one cold.
The old women stood with the holy ikons. Sheep, calves, cows were driven
out of the back-yards into the street; boxes, sheepskins, tubs were
carried out. A black stallion, who was kept apart from the drove of horses
because he kicked and injured them, on being set free ran once or twice up
and down the village, neighing and pawing the ground; then suddenly
stopped short near a cart and began kicking it with his hind-legs.

 They began ringing the bells in the church on the other side of the river.

 Near the burning hut it was hot and so light that one could distinctly see
every blade of grass. Semyon, a red-haired peasant with a long nose,
wearing a reefer-jacket and a cap pulled down right over his ears, sat on
one of the boxes which they had succeeded in bringing out: his wife was
lying on her face, moaning and unconscious. A little old man of eighty,
with a big beard, who looked like a gnome—not one of the villagers,
though obviously connected in some way with the fire—walked about
bareheaded, with a white bundle in his arms. The glare was reflected on
his bald head. The village elder, Antip Syedelnikov, as swarthy and
black-haired as a gypsy, went up to the hut with an axe, and hacked out
the windows one after another—no one knew why—then began
chopping up the roof.

 “Women, water!” he shouted. “Bring the engine! Look sharp!”

 The peasants, who had been drinking in the tavern just before, dragged the
engine up. They were all drunk; they kept stumbling and falling down, and
all had a helpless expression and tears in their eyes.

 “Wenches, water!” shouted the elder, who was drunk, too. “Look sharp,
wenches!”

 The women and the girls ran downhill to where there was a spring, and kept
hauling pails and buckets of water up the hill, and, pouring it into the
engine, ran down again. Olga and Marya and Sasha and Motka all brought
water. The women and the boys pumped the water; the pipe hissed, and the
elder, directing it now at the door, now at the windows, held back the
stream with his finger, which made it hiss more sharply still.

 “Bravo, Antip!” voices shouted approvingly. “Do your best.”

 Antip went inside the hut into the fire and shouted from within.

 “Pump! Bestir yourselves, good Christian folk, in such a terrible
mischance!”

 The peasants stood round in a crowd, doing nothing but staring at the
fire. No one knew what to do, no one had the sense to do anything, though
there were stacks of wheat, hay, barns, and piles of faggots standing all
round. Kiryak and old Osip, his father, both tipsy, were standing there,
too. And as though to justify his doing nothing, old Osip said, addressing
the woman who lay on the ground:

 “What is there to trouble about, old girl! The hut is insured—why
are you taking on?”

 Semyon, addressing himself first to one person and then to another, kept
describing how the fire had started.

 “That old man, the one with the bundle, a house-serf of General
Zhukov’s.... He was cook at our general’s, God rest his soul! He came over
this evening: ‘Let me stay the night,’ says he.... Well, we had a glass,
to be sure.... The wife got the samovar—she was going to give the
old fellow a cup of tea, and in an unlucky hour she set the samovar in the
entrance. The sparks from the chimney must have blown straight up to the
thatch; that’s how it was. We were almost burnt ourselves. And the old
fellow’s cap has been burnt; what a shame!”

 And the sheet of iron was struck indefatigably, and the bells kept ringing
in the church the other side of the river. In the glow of the fire, Olga,
breathless, looking with horror at the red sheep and the pink doves flying
in the smoke, kept running down the hill and up again. It seemed to her
that the ringing went to her heart with a sharp stab, that the fire would
never be over, that Sasha was lost.... And when the ceiling of the hut
fell in with a crash, the thought that now the whole village would be
burnt made her weak and faint, and she could not go on fetching water, but
sat down on the ravine, setting the pail down near her; beside her and
below her, the peasant women sat wailing as though at a funeral.

 Then the stewards and watchmen from the estate the other side of the river
arrived in two carts, bringing with them a fire-engine. A very young
student in an unbuttoned white tunic rode up on horseback. There was the
thud of axes. They put a ladder to the burning framework of the house, and
five men ran up it at once. Foremost of them all was the student, who was
red in the face and shouting in a harsh hoarse voice, and in a tone as
though putting out fires was a thing he was used to. They pulled the house
to pieces, a beam at a time; they dragged away the corn, the hurdles, and
the stacks that were near.

 “Don’t let them break it up!” cried stern voices in the crowd. “Don’t let
them.”

 Kiryak made his way up to the hut with a resolute air, as though he meant
to prevent the newcomers from breaking up the hut, but one of the workmen
turned him back with a blow in his neck. There was the sound of laughter,
the workman dealt him another blow, Kiryak fell down, and crawled back
into the crowd on his hands and knees.

 Two handsome girls in hats, probably the student’s sisters, came from the
other side of the river. They stood a little way off, looking at the fire.
The beams that had been dragged apart were no longer burning, but were
smoking vigorously; the student, who was working the hose, turned the
water, first on the beams, then on the peasants, then on the women who
were bringing the water.

 “George!” the girls called to him reproachfully in anxiety, “George!”

 The fire was over. And only when they began to disperse they noticed that
the day was breaking, that everyone was pale and rather dark in the face,
as it always seems in the early morning when the last stars are going out.
As they separated, the peasants laughed and made jokes about General
Zhukov’s cook and his cap which had been burnt; they already wanted to
turn the fire into a joke, and even seemed sorry that it had so soon been
put out.

 “How well you extinguished the fire, sir!” said Olga to the student. “You
ought to come to us in Moscow: there we have a fire every day.”

 “Why, do you come from Moscow?” asked one of the young ladies.

 “Yes, miss. My husband was a waiter at the Slavyansky Bazaar. And this is
my daughter,” she said, indicating Sasha, who was cold and huddling up to
her. “She is a Moscow girl, too.”

 The two young ladies said something in French to the student, and he gave
Sasha a twenty-kopeck piece.

 Old Father Osip saw this, and there was a gleam of hope in his face.

 “We must thank God, your honour, there was no wind,” he said, addressing
the student, “or else we should have been all burnt up together. Your
honour, kind gentlefolks,” he added in embarrassment in a lower tone, “the
morning’s chilly... something to warm one... half a bottle to your
honour’s health.”

 Nothing was given him, and clearing his throat he slouched home. Olga
stood afterwards at the end of the street and watched the two carts
crossing the river by the ford and the gentlefolks walking across the
meadow; a carriage was waiting for them the other side of the river. Going
into the hut, she described to her husband with enthusiasm:

 “Such good people! And so beautiful! The young ladies were like cherubim.”

 “Plague take them!” Fyokla, sleepy, said spitefully.

 VI

 Marya thought herself unhappy, and said that she would be very glad to
die; Fyokla, on the other hand, found all this life to her taste: the
poverty, the uncleanliness, and the incessant quarrelling. She ate what
was given her without discrimination; slept anywhere, on whatever came to
hand. She would empty the slops just at the porch, would splash them out
from the doorway, and then walk barefoot through the puddle. And from the
very first day she took a dislike to Olga and Nikolay just because they
did not like this life.

 “We shall see what you’ll find to eat here, you Moscow gentry!” she said
malignantly. “We shall see!”

 One morning, it was at the beginning of September, Fyokla, vigorous,
good-looking, and rosy from the cold, brought up two pails of water; Marya
and Olga were sitting meanwhile at the table drinking tea.

 “Tea and sugar,” said Fyokla sarcastically. “The fine ladies!” she added,
setting down the pails. “You have taken to the fashion of tea every day.
You better look out that you don’t burst with your tea-drinking,” she went
on, looking with hatred at Olga. “That’s how you have come by your fat
mug, having a good time in Moscow, you lump of flesh!” She swung the yoke
and hit Olga such a blow on the shoulder that the two sisters-in-law could
only clasp their hands and say:

 “Oh, holy Saints!”

 Then Fyokla went down to the river to wash the clothes, swearing all the
time so loudly that she could be heard in the hut.

 The day passed and was followed by the long autumn evening. They wound
silk in the hut; everyone did it except Fyokla; she had gone over the
river. They got the silk from a factory close by, and the whole family
working together earned next to nothing, twenty kopecks a week.

 “Things were better in the old days under the gentry,” said the old father
as he wound silk. “You worked and ate and slept, everything in its turn.
At dinner you had cabbage-soup and boiled grain, and at supper the same
again. Cucumbers and cabbage in plenty: you could eat to your heart’s
content, as much as you wanted. And there was more strictness. Everyone
minded what he was about.”

 The hut was lighted by a single little lamp, which burned dimly and
smoked. When someone screened the lamp and a big shadow fell across the
window, the bright moonlight could be seen. Old Osip, speaking slowly,
told them how they used to live before the emancipation; how in those very
parts, where life was now so poor and so dreary, they used to hunt with
harriers, greyhounds, retrievers, and when they went out as beaters the
peasants were given vodka; how whole waggonloads of game used to be sent
to Moscow for the young masters; how the bad were beaten with rods or sent
away to the Tver estate, while the good were rewarded. And Granny told
them something, too. She remembered everything, positively everything. She
described her mistress, a kind, God-fearing woman, whose husband was a
profligate and a rake, and all of whose daughters made unlucky marriages:
one married a drunkard, another married a workman, the other eloped
secretly (Granny herself, at that time a young girl, helped in the
elopement), and they had all three as well as their mother died early from
grief. And remembering all this, Granny positively began to shed tears.

 All at once someone knocked at the door, and they all started.

 “Uncle Osip, give me a night’s lodging.”

 The little bald old man, General Zhukov’s cook, the one whose cap had been
burnt, walked in. He sat down and listened, then he, too, began telling
stories of all sorts. Nikolay, sitting on the stove with his legs hanging
down, listened and asked questions about the dishes that were prepared in
the old days for the gentry. They talked of rissoles, cutlets, various
soups and sauces, and the cook, who remembered everything very well,
mentioned dishes that are no longer served. There was one, for instance—a
dish made of bulls’ eyes, which was called “waking up in the morning.”

 “And used you to do cutlets a la marechal?” asked Nikolay.

 “No.”

 Nikolay shook his head reproachfully and said:

 “Tut, tut! You were not much of a cook!”

 The little girls sitting and lying on the stove stared down without
bJlinking; it seemed as though there were a great many of them, like
cherubim in the clouds. They liked the stories: they were breathless; they
shuddered and turned pale with alternate rapture and terror, and they
listened breathlessly, afraid to stir, to Granny, whose stories were the
most interesting of all.

 They lay down to sleep in silence; and the old people, troubled and
excited by their reminiscences, thought how precious was youth, of which,
whatever it might have been like, nothing was left in the memory but what
was living, joyful, touching, and how terribly cold was death, which was
not far off, better not think of it! The lamp died down. And the dusk, and
the two little windows sharply defined by the moonlight, and the stillness
and the creak of the cradle, reminded them for some reason that life was
over, that nothing one could do would bring it back.... You doze off, you
forget yourself, and suddenly someone touches your shoulder or breathes on
your cheek—and sleep is gone; your body feels cramped, and thoughts
of death keep creeping into your mind. You turn on the other side: death
is forgotten, but old dreary, sickening thoughts of poverty, of food, of
how dear flour is getting, stray through the mind, and a little later
again you remember that life is over and you cannot bring it back....

 “Oh, Lord!” sighed the cook.

 Someone gave a soft, soft tap at the window. It must be Fyokla come back.
Olga got up, and yawning and whispering a prayer, opened the door, then
drew the bolt in the outer room, but no one came in; only from the street
came a cold draught and a sudden brightness from the moonlight. The
street, still and deserted, and the moon itself floating across the sky,
could be seen at the open door.

 “Who is there?” called Olga.

 “I,” she heard the answer—“it is I.”

 Near the door, crouching against the wall, stood Fyokla, absolutely naked.
She was shivering with cold, her teeth were chattering, and in the bright
moonlight she looked very pale, strange, and beautiful. The shadows on
her, and the bright moonlight on her skin, stood out vividly, and her dark
eyebrows and firm, youthful bosom were defined with peculiar distinctness.

 “The ruffians over there undressed me and turned me out like this,” she
said. “I’ve come home without my clothes... naked as my mother bore me.
Bring me something to put on.”

 “But go inside!” Olga said softly, beginning to shiver, too.

 “I don’t want the old folks to see.” Granny was, in fact, already stirring
and muttering, and the old father asked: “Who is there?” Olga brought her
own smock and skirt, dressed Fyokla, and then both went softly into the
inner room, trying not to make a noise with the door.

 “Is that you, you sleek one?” Granny grumbled angrily, guessing who it
was. “Fie upon you, nightwalker!... Bad luck to you!”

 “It’s all right, it’s all right,” whispered Olga, wrapping Fyokla up;
“it’s all right, dearie.”

 All was stillness again. They always slept badly; everyone was kept awake
by something worrying and persistent: the old man by the pain in his back,
Granny by anxiety and anger, Marya by terror, the children by itch and
hunger. Now, too, their sleep was troubled; they kept turning over from
one side to the other, talking in their sleep, getting up for a drink.

 Fyokla suddenly broke into a loud, coarse howl, but immediately checked
herself, and only uttered sobs from time to time, growing softer and on a
lower note, until she relapsed into silence. From time to time from the
other side of the river there floated the sound of the beating of the
hours; but the time seemed somehow strange—five was struck and then
three.

 “Oh Lord!” sighed the cook.

 Looking at the windows, it was difficult to tell whether it was still
moonlight or whether the dawn had begun. Marya got up and went out, and
she could be heard milking the cows and saying, “Stea-dy!” Granny went
out, too. It was still dark in the hut, but all the objects in it could be
discerned.

 Nikolay, who had not slept all night, got down from the stove. He took his
dress-coat out of a green box, put it on, and going to the window, stroked
the sleeves and took hold of the coat-tails—and smiled. Then he
carefully took off the coat, put it away in his box, and lay down again.

 Marya came in again and began lighting the stove. She was evidently hardly
awake, and seemed dropping asleep as she walked. Probably she had had some
dream, or the stories of the night before came into her mind as,
stretching luxuriously before the stove, she said:

 “No, freedom is better.”

 VII

 The master arrived—that was what they called the police inspector.
When he would come and what he was coming for had been known for the last
week. There were only forty households in Zhukovo, but more than two
thousand roubles of arrears of rates and taxes had accumulated.

 The police inspector stopped at the tavern. He drank there two glasses of
tea, and then went on foot to the village elder’s hut, near which a crowd
of those who were in debt stood waiting. The elder, Antip Syedelnikov,
was, in spite of his youth—he was only a little over thirty—strict
and always on the side of the authorities, though he himself was poor and
did not pay his taxes regularly. Evidently he enjoyed being elder, and
liked the sense of authority, which he could only display by strictness.
In the village council the peasants were afraid of him and obeyed him. It
would sometimes happen that he would pounce on a drunken man in the street
or near the tavern, tie his hands behind him, and put him in the lock-up.
On one occasion he even put Granny in the lock-up because she went to the
village council instead of Osip, and began swearing, and he kept her there
for a whole day and night. He had never lived in a town or read a book,
but somewhere or other had picked up various learned expressions, and
loved to make use of them in conversation, and he was respected for this
though he was not always understood.

 When Osip came into the village elder’s hut with his tax book, the police
inspector, a lean old man with a long grey beard, in a grey tunic, was
sitting at a table in the passage, writing something. It was clean in the
hut; all the walls were dotted with pictures cut out of the illustrated
papers, and in the most conspicuous place near the ikon there was a
portrait of the Battenburg who was the Prince of Bulgaria. By the table
stood Antip Syedelnikov with his arms folded.

 “There is one hundred and nineteen roubles standing against him,” he said
when it came to Osip’s turn. “Before Easter he paid a rouble, and he has
not paid a kopeck since.”

 The police inspector raised his eyes to Osip and asked:

 “Why is this, brother?”

 “Show Divine mercy, your honour,” Osip began, growing agitated. “Allow me
to say last year the gentleman at Lutorydsky said to me, ‘Osip,’ he said,
‘sell your hay... you sell it,’ he said. Well, I had a hundred poods for
sale; the women mowed it on the water-meadow. Well, we struck a bargain
all right, willingly....”

 He complained of the elder, and kept turning round to the peasants as
though inviting them to bear witness; his face flushed red and perspired,
and his eyes grew sharp and angry.

 “I don’t know why you are saying all this,” said the police inspector. “I
am asking you... I am asking you why you don’t pay your arrears. You don’t
pay, any of you, and am I to be responsible for you?”

 “I can’t do it.”

 “His words have no sequel, your honour,” said the elder. “The
Tchikildyeevs certainly are of a defective class, but if you will just ask
the others, the root of it all is vodka, and they are a very bad lot. With
no sort of understanding.”

 The police inspector wrote something down, and said to Osip quietly, in an
even tone, as though he were asking him for water:

 “Be off.”

 Soon he went away; and when he got into his cheap chaise and cleared his
throat, it could be seen from the very expression of his long thin back
that he was no longer thinking of Osip or of the village elder, nor of the
Zhukovo arrears, but was thinking of his own affairs. Before he had gone
three-quarters of a mile Antip was already carrying off the samovar from
the Tchikildyeevs’ cottage, followed by Granny, screaming shrilly and
straining her throat:

 “I won’t let you have it, I won’t let you have it, damn you!”

 He walked rapidly with long steps, and she pursued him panting, almost
falling over, a bent, ferocious figure; her kerchief slipped on to her
shoulders, her grey hair with greenish lights on it was blown about in the
wind. She suddenly stopped short, and like a genuine rebel, fell to
beating her breast with her fists and shouting louder than ever in a
sing-song voice, as though she were sobbing:

 “Good Christians and believers in God! Neighbours, they have ill-treated
me! Kind friends, they have oppressed me! Oh, oh! dear people, take my
part.”

 “Granny, Granny!” said the village elder sternly, “have some sense in your
head!”

 It was hopelessly dreary in the Tchikildyeevs’ hut without the samovar;
there was something humiliating in this loss, insulting, as though the
honour of the hut had been outraged. Better if the elder had carried off
the table, all the benches, all the pots—it would not have seemed so
empty. Granny screamed, Marya cried, and the little girls, looking at her,
cried, too. The old father, feeling guilty, sat in the corner with bowed
head and said nothing. And Nikolay, too, was silent. Granny loved him and
was sorry for him, but now, forgetting her pity, she fell upon him with
abuse, with reproaches, shaking her fist right in his face. She shouted
that it was all his fault; why had he sent them so little when he boasted
in his letters that he was getting fifty roubles a month at the Slavyansky
Bazaar? Why had he come, and with his family, too? If he died, where was
the money to come from for his funeral...? And it was pitiful to look at
Nikolay, Olga, and Sasha.

 The old father cleared his throat, took his cap, and went off to the
village elder. Antip was soldering something by the stove, puffing out his
cheeks; there was a smell of burning. His children, emaciated and
unwashed, no better than the Tchikildyeevs, were scrambling about the
floor; his wife, an ugly, freckled woman with a prominent stomach, was
winding silk. They were a poor, unlucky family, and Antip was the only one
who looked vigorous and handsome. On a bench there were five samovars
standing in a row. The old man said his prayer to Battenburg and said:

 “Antip, show the Divine mercy. Give me back the samovar, for Christ’s
sake!”

 “Bring three roubles, then you shall have it.”

 “I can’t do it!”

 Antip puffed out his cheeks, the fire roared and hissed, and the glow was
reflected in the samovar. The old man crumpled up his cap and said after a
moment’s thought:

 “You give it me back.”

 The swarthy elder looked quite black, and was like a magician; he turned
round to Osip and said sternly and rapidly:

 “It all depends on the rural captain. On the twenty-sixth instant you can
state the grounds for your dissatisfaction before the administrative
session, verbally or in writing.”

 Osip did not understand a word, but he was satisfied with that and went
home.

 Ten days later the police inspector came again, stayed an hour and went
away. During those days the weather had changed to cold and windy; the
river had been frozen for some time past, but still there was no snow, and
people found it difficult to get about. On the eve of a holiday some of
the neighbours came in to Osip’s to sit and have a talk. They did not
light the lamp, as it would have been a sin to work, but talked in the
darkness. There were some items of news, all rather unpleasant. In two or
three households hens had been taken for the arrears, and had been sent to
the district police station, and there they had died because no one had
fed them; they had taken sheep, and while they were being driven away tied
to one another, shifted into another cart at each village, one of them had
died. And now they were discussing the question, who was to blame?

 “The Zemstvo,” said Osip. “Who else?”

 “Of course it is the Zemstvo.”

 The Zemstvo was blamed for everything—for the arrears, and for the
oppressions, and for the failure of the crops, though no one of them knew
what was meant by the Zemstvo. And this dated from the time when
well-to-do peasants who had factories, shops, and inns of their own were
members of the Zemstvos, were dissatisfied with them, and took to swearing
at the Zemstvos in their factories and inns.

 They talked of God’s not sending the snow; they had to bring in wood for
fuel, and there was no driving nor walking in the frozen ruts. In old days
fifteen to twenty years ago conversation was much more interesting in
Zhukovo. In those days every old man looked as though he were treasuring
some secret; as though he knew something and was expecting something. They
used to talk about an edict in golden letters, about the division of
lands, about new land, about treasures; they hinted at something. Now the
people of Zhukovo had no mystery at all; their whole life was bare and
open in the sight of all, and they could talk of nothing but poverty,
food, there being no snow yet....

 There was a pause. Then they thought again of the hens, of the sheep, and
began discussing whose fault it was.

 “The Zemstvo,” said Osip wearily. “Who else?”

 VIII

 The parish church was nearly five miles away at Kosogorovo, and the
peasants only attended it when they had to do so for baptisms, weddings,
or funerals; they went to the services at the church across the river. On
holidays in fine weather the girls dressed up in their best and went in a
crowd together to church, and it was a cheering sight to see them in their
red, yellow, and green dresses cross the meadow; in bad weather they all
stayed at home. They went for the sacrament to the parish church. From
each of those who did not manage in Lent to go to confession in readiness
for the sacrament the parish priest, going the round of the huts with the
cross at Easter, took fifteen kopecks.

 The old father did not believe in God, for he hardly ever thought about
Him; he recognized the supernatural, but considered it was entirely the
women’s concern, and when religion or miracles were discussed before him,
or a question were put to him, he would say reluctantly, scratching
himself:

 “Who can tell!”

 Granny believed, but her faith was somewhat hazy; everything was mixed up
in her memory, and she could scarcely begin to think of sins, of death, of
the salvation of the soul, before poverty and her daily cares took
possession of her mind, and she instantly forgot what she was thinking
about. She did not remember the prayers, and usually in the evenings,
before lying down to sleep, she would stand before the ikons and whisper:

 “Holy Mother of Kazan, Holy Mother of Smolensk, Holy Mother of
Troerutchitsy...”

 Marya and Fyokla crossed themselves, fasted, and took the sacrament every
year, but understood nothing. The children were not taught their prayers,
nothing was told them about God, and no moral principles were instilled
into them; they were only forbidden to eat meat or milk in Lent. In the
other families it was much the same: there were few who believed, few who
understood. At the same time everyone loved the Holy Scripture, loved it
with a tender, reverent love; but they had no Bible, there was no one to
read it and explain it, and because Olga sometimes read them the gospel,
they respected her, and they all addressed her and Sasha as though they
were superior to themselves.

 For church holidays and services Olga often went to neighbouring villages,
and to the district town, in which there were two monasteries and
twenty-seven churches. She was dreamy, and when she was on these
pilgrimages she quite forgot her family, and only when she got home again
suddenly made the joyful discovery that she had a husband and daughter,
and then would say, smiling and radiant:

 “God has sent me blessings!”

 What went on in the village worried her and seemed to her revolting. On
Elijah’s Day they drank, at the Assumption they drank, at the Ascension
they drank. The Feast of the Intercession was the parish holiday for
Zhukovo, and the peasants used to drink then for three days; they
squandered on drink fifty roubles of money belonging to the Mir, and then
collected more for vodka from all the households. On the first day of the
feast the Tchikildyeevs killed a sheep and ate of it in the morning, at
dinner-time, and in the evening; they ate it ravenously, and the children
got up at night to eat more. Kiryak was fearfully drunk for three whole
days; he drank up everything, even his boots and cap, and beat Marya so
terribly that they had to pour water over her. And then they were all
ashamed and sick.

 However, even in Zhukovo, in this “Slaveytown,” there was once an outburst
of genuine religious enthusiasm. It was in August, when throughout the
district they carried from village to village the Holy Mother, the giver
of life. It was still and overcast on the day when they expected Her at Zhukovo. The girls set off in the morning to meet the ikon, in their
bright holiday dresses, and brought Her towards the evening, in procession
with the cross and with singing, while the bells pealed in the church
across the river. An immense crowd of villagers and strangers flooded the
street; there was noise, dust, a great crush.... And the old father and
Granny and Kiryak—all stretched out their hands to the ikon, looked
eagerly at it and said, weeping:

 “Defender! Mother! Defender!”

 All seemed suddenly to realize that there was not an empty void between
earth and heaven, that the rich and the powerful had not taken possession
of everything, that there was still a refuge from injury, from slavish
bondage, from crushing, unendurable poverty, from the terrible vodka.

 “Defender! Mother!” sobbed Marya. “Mother!”

 But the thanksgiving service ended and the ikon was carried away, and
everything went on as before; and again there was a sound of coarse
drunken oaths from the tavern.

 Only the well-to-do peasants were afraid of death; the richer they were
the less they believed in God, and in the salvation of souls, and only
through fear of the end of the world put up candles and had services said
for them, to be on the safe side. The peasants who were rather poorer were
not afraid of death. The old father and Granny were told to their faces
that they had lived too long, that it was time they were dead, and they
did not mind. They did not hinder Fyokla from saying in Nikolay’s presence
that when Nikolay died her husband Denis would get exemption—to
return home from the army. And Marya, far from fearing death, regretted
that it was so slow in coming, and was glad when her children died.

 Death they did not fear, but of every disease they had an exaggerated
terror. The merest trifle was enough—a stomach upset, a slight
chill, and Granny would be wrapped up on the stove, and would begin
moaning loudly and incessantly:

 “I am dy-ing!”

 The old father hurried off for the priest, and Granny received the
sacrament and extreme unction. They often talked of colds, of worms, of
tumours which move in the stomach and coil round to the heart. Above all,
they were afraid of catching cold, and so put on thick clothes even in the
summer and warmed themselves at the stove. Granny was fond of being
doctored, and often went to the hospital, where she used to say she was
not seventy, but fifty-eight; she supposed that if the doctor knew her
real age he would not treat her, but would say it was time she died
instead of taking medicine. She usually went to the hospital early in the
morning, taking with her two or three of the little girls, and came back
in the evening, hungry and ill-tempered—with drops for herself and
ointments for the little girls. Once she took Nikolay, who swallowed drops
for a fortnight afterwards, and said he felt better.

 Granny knew all the doctors and their assistants and the wise men for
twenty miles round, and not one of them she liked. At the Intercession,
when the priest made the round of the huts with the cross, the deacon told
her that in the town near the prison lived an old man who had been a
medical orderly in the army, and who made wonderful cures, and advised her
to try him. Granny took his advice. When the first snow fell she drove to
the town and fetched an old man with a big beard, a converted Jew, in a
long gown, whose face was covered with blue veins. There were outsiders at
work in the hut at the time: an old tailor, in terrible spectacles, was
cutting a waistcoat out of some rags, and two young men were making felt
boots out of wool; Kiryak, who had been dismissed from his place for
drunkenness, and now lived at home, was sitting beside the tailor mending
a bridle. And it was crowded, stifling, and noisome in the hut. The
converted Jew examined Nikolay and said that it was necessary to try
cupping.

 He put on the cups, and the old tailor, Kiryak, and the little girls stood
round and looked on, and it seemed to them that they saw the disease being
drawn out of Nikolay; and Nikolay, too, watched how the cups suckling at
his breast gradually filled with dark blood, and felt as though there
really were something coming out of him, and smiled with pleasure.

 “It’s a good thing,” said the tailor. “Please God, it will do you good.”

 The Jew put on twelve cups and then another twelve, drank some tea, and
went away. Nikolay began shivering; his face looked drawn, and, as the
women expressed it, shrank up like a fist; his fingers turned blue. He
wrapped himself up in a quilt and in a sheepskin, but got colder and
colder. Towards the evening he began to be in great distress; asked to be
laid on the ground, asked the tailor not to smoke; then he subsided under
the sheepskin and towards morning he died.

 Oh, what a grim, what a long winter!

 Their own grain did not last beyond Christmas, and they had to buy flour.
Kiryak, who lived at home now, was noisy in the evenings, inspiring terror
in everyone, and in the mornings he suffered from headache and was
ashamed; and he was a pitiful sight. In the stall the starved cows
bellowed day and night—a heart-rending sound to Granny and Marya.
And as ill-luck would have it, there was a sharp frost all the winter, the
snow drifted in high heaps, and the winter dragged on. At Annunciation
there was a regular blizzard, and there was a fall of snow at Easter.

 But in spite of it all the winter did end. At the beginning of April there
came warm days and frosty nights. Winter would not give way, but one warm
day overpowered it at last, and the streams began to flow and the birds
began to sing. The whole meadow and the bushes near the river were drowned
in the spring floods, and all the space between Zhukovo and the further
side was filled up with a vast sheet of water, from which wild ducks rose
up in flocks here and there. The spring sunset, flaming among gorgeous
clouds, gave every evening something new, extraordinary, incredible—just
what one does not believe in afterwards, when one sees those very colours
and those very clouds in a picture.

 The cranes flew swiftly, swiftly, with mournful cries, as though they were
calling themselves. Standing on the edge of the ravine, Olga looked a long
time at the flooded meadow, at the sunshine, at the bright church, that
looked as though it had grown younger; and her tears flowed and her breath
came in gasps from her passionate longing to go away, to go far away to
the end of the world. It was already settled that she should go back to
Moscow to be a servant, and that Kiryak should set off with her to get a
job as a porter or something. Oh, to get away quickly!

 As soon as it dried up and grew warm they got ready to set off. Olga and
Sasha, with wallets on their backs and shoes of plaited bark on their
feet, came out before daybreak: Marya came out, too, to see them on their
way. Kiryak was not well, and was kept at home for another week. For the
last time Olga prayed at the church and thought of her husband, and though
she did not shed tears, her face puckered up and looked ugly like an old
woman’s. During the winter she had grown thinner and plainer, and her hair
had gone a little grey, and instead of the old look of sweetness and the
pleasant smile on her face, she had the resigned, mournful expression left
by the sorrows she had been through, and there was something blank and
irresponsive in her eyes, as though she did not hear what was said. She
was sorry to part from the village and the peasants. She remembered how
they had carried out Nikolay, and how a requiem had been ordered for him
at almost every hut, and all had shed tears in sympathy with her grief. In
the course of the summer and the winter there had been hours and days when
it seemed as though these people lived worse than the beasts, and to live
with them was terrible; they were coarse, dishonest, filthy, and drunken;
they did not live in harmony, but quarrelled continually, because they
distrusted and feared and did not respect one another. Who keeps the
tavern and makes the people drunken? A peasant. Who wastes and spends on
drink the funds of the commune, of the schools, of the church? A peasant.
Who stole from his neighbours, set fire to their property, gave false
witness at the court for a bottle of vodka? At the meetings of the Zemstvo
and other local bodies, who was the first to fall foul of the peasants? A
peasant. Yes, to live with them was terrible; but yet, they were human
beings, they suffered and wept like human beings, and there was nothing in
their lives for which one could not find excuse. Hard labour that made the
whole body ache at night, the cruel winters, the scanty harvests, the
overcrowding; and they had no help and none to whom they could look for
help. Those of them who were a little stronger and better off could be no
help, as they were themselves coarse, dishonest, drunken, and abused one
another just as revoltingly; the paltriest little clerk or official
treated the peasants as though they were tramps, and addressed even the
village elders and church wardens as inferiors, and considered they had a
right to do so. And, indeed, can any sort of help or good example be given
by mercenary, greedy, depraved, and idle persons who only visit the
village in order to insult, to despoil, and to terrorize? Olga remembered
the pitiful, humiliated look of the old people when in the winter Kiryak
had been taken to be flogged.... And now she felt sorry for all these
people, painfully so, and as she walked on she kept looking back at the
huts.

 After walking two miles with them Marya said good-bye, then kneeling, and
falling forward with her face on the earth, she began wailing:

 “Again I am left alone. Alas, for poor me! poor, unhappy!...”

 And she wailed like this for a long time, and for a long way Olga and
Sasha could still see her on her knees, bowing down to someone at the side
and clutching her head in her hands, while the rooks flew over her head.

 The sun rose high; it began to get hot. Zhukovo was left far behind.
Walking was pleasant. Olga and Sasha soon forgot both the village and
Marya; they were gay and everything entertained them. Now they came upon
an ancient barrow, now upon a row of telegraph posts running one after
another into the distance and disappearing into the horizon, and the wires
hummed mysteriously. Then they saw a homestead, all wreathed in green
foliage; there came a scent from it of dampness, of hemp, and it seemed
for some reason that happy people lived there. Then they came upon a
horse’s skeleton whitening in solitude in the open fields. And the larks
trilled unceasingly, the corncrakes called to one another, and the
landrail cried as though someone were really scraping at an old iron rail.

 At midday Olga and Sasha reached a big village. There in the broad street
they met the little old man who was General Zhukov’s cook. He was hot, and
his red, perspiring bald head shone in the sunshine. Olga and he did not
recognize each other, then looked round at the same moment, recognized
each other, and went their separate ways without saying a word. Stopping
near the hut which looked newest and most prosperous, Olga bowed down
before the open windows, and said in a loud, thin, chanting voice:

 “Good Christian folk, give alms, for Christ’s sake, that God’s blessing
may be upon you, and that your parents may be in the Kingdom of Heaven in
peace eternal.”

 “Good Christian folk,” Sasha began chanting, “give, for Christ’s sake,
that God’s blessing, the Heavenly Kingdom...”
