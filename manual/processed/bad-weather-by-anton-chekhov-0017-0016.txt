BAD WEATHER

 BIG raindrops were pattering on the dark windows. It was one of those
      disgusting summer holiday rains which, when they have begun, last a long
      time-for weeks, till the frozen holiday maker grows used to it, and sinks
      into complete apathy. It was cold; there was a feeling of raw, unpleasant
      dampness. The mother-in-law of a lawyer, called Kvashin, and his wife,
      Nadyezhda Filippovna, dressed in waterproofs and shawls, were sitting over
      the dinner table in the dining-room. It was written on the countenance of
      the elder lady that she was, thank God, well-fed, well-clothed and in good
      health, that she had married her only daughter to a good man, and now
      could play her game of patience with an easy conscience; her daughter, a
      rather short, plump, fair young woman of twenty, with a gentle an√¶mic
      face, was reading a book with her elbows on the table; judging from her
      eyes she was not so much reading as thinking her own thoughts, which were
      not in the book. Neither of them spoke. There was the sound of the
      pattering rain, and from the kitchen they could hear the prolonged yawns
      of the cook.

 Kvashin himself was not at home. On rainy days he did not come to the
      summer villa, but stayed in town; damp, rainy weather affected his
      bronchitis and prevented him from working. He was of the opinion that the
      sight of the grey sky and the tears of rain on the windows deprived one of
      energy and induced the spleen. In the town, where there was greater
      comfort, bad weather was scarcely noticed.

 After two games of patience, the old lady shuffled the cards and took a
      glance at her daughter.

 "I have been trying with the cards whether it will be fine to-morrow, and
      whether our Alexey Stepanovitch will come," she said. "It is five days
      since he was here. . . . The weather is a chastisement from God."

 Nadyezhda Filippovna looked indifferently at her mother, got up, and began
      walking up and down the room.

 "The barometer was rising yesterday," she said doubtfully, "but they say
      it is falling again to-day."

 The old lady laid out the cards in three long rows and shook her head.

 "Do you miss him?" she asked, glancing at her daughter.

 "Of course."

 "I see you do. I should think so. He hasn't been here for five days. In
      May the utmost was two, or at most three days, and now it is serious, five
      days! I am not his wife, and yet I miss him. And yesterday, when I heard
      the barometer was rising, I ordered them to kill a chicken and prepare a
      carp for Alexey Stepanovitch. He likes them. Your poor father couldn't
      bear fish, but he likes it. He always eats it with relish."

 "My heart aches for him," said the daughter. "We are dull, but it is
      duller still for him, you know, mamma."

 "I should think so! In the law-courts day in and day out, and in the empty
      flat at night alone like an owl."

 "And what is so awful, mamma, he is alone there without servants; there is
      no one to set the samovar or bring him water. Why didn't he engage a valet
      for the summer months? And what use is the summer villa at all if he does
      not care for it? I told him there was no need to have it, but no, 'It is
      for the sake of your health,' he said, and what is wrong with my health?
      It makes me ill that he should have to put up with so much on my account."

 Looking over her mother's shoulder, the daughter noticed a mistake in the
      patience, bent down to the table and began correcting it. A silence
      followed. Both looked at the cards and imagined how their Alexey
      Stepanovitch, utterly forlorn, was sitting now in the town in his gloomy,
      empty study and working, hungry, exhausted, yearning for his family. . . .

 "Do you know what, mamma?" said Nadyezhda Filippovna suddenly, and her
      eyes began to shine. "If the weather is the same to-morrow I'll go by the
      first train and see him in town! Anyway, I shall find out how he is, have
      a look at him, and pour out his tea."

 And both of them began to wonder how it was that this idea, so simple and
      easy to carry out, had not occurred to them before. It was only half an
      hour in the train to the town, and then twenty minutes in a cab. They said
      a little more, and went off to bed in the same room, feeling more
      contented.

 "Oho-ho-ho. . . . Lord, forgive us sinners!" sighed the old lady when the
      clock in the hall struck two. "There is no sleeping."

 "You are not asleep, mamma?" the daughter asked in a whisper. "I keep
      thinking of Alyosha. I only hope he won't ruin his health in town.
      Goodness knows where he dines and lunches. In restaurants and taverns."

 "I have thought of that myself," sighed the old lady. "The Heavenly Mother
      save and preserve him. But the rain, the rain!"

 In the morning the rain was not pattering on the panes, but the sky was
      still grey. The trees stood looking mournful, and at every gust of wind
      they scattered drops. The footprints on the muddy path, the ditches and
      the ruts were full of water. Nadyezhda Filippovna made up her mind to go.

 "Give him my love," said the old lady, wrapping her daughter up. "Tell him
      not to think too much about his cases. . . . And he must rest. Let him
      wrap his throat up when he goes out: the weather-God help us! And take him
      the chicken; food from home, even if cold, is better than at a
      restaurant."

 The daughter went away, saying that she would come back by an evening
      train or else next morning.

 But she came back long before dinner-time, when the old lady was sitting
      on her trunk in her bedroom and drowsily thinking what to cook for her
      son-in-law's supper.

 Going into the room her daughter, pale and agitated, sank on the bed
      without uttering a word or taking off her hat, and pressed her head into
      the pillow.

 "But what is the matter," said the old lady in surprise, "why back so
      soon? Where is Alexey Stepanovitch?"

 Nadyezhda Filippovna raised her head and gazed at her mother with dry,
      imploring eyes.

 "He is deceiving us, mamma," she said.

 "What are you saying? Christ be with you!" cried the old lady in alarm,
      and her cap slipped off her head. "Who is going to deceive us? Lord, have
      mercy on us!"

 "He is deceiving us, mamma!" repeated her daughter, and her chin began to
      quiver.

 "How do you know?" cried the old lady, turning pale.

 "Our flat is locked up. The porter tells me that Alyosha has not been home
      once for these five days. He is not living at home! He is not at home, not
      at home!"

 She waved her hands and burst into loud weeping, uttering nothing but:
      "Not at home! Not at home!"

 She began to be hysterical.

 "What's the meaning of it?" muttered the old woman in horror. "Why, he
      wrote the day before yesterday that he never leaves the flat! Where is he
      sleeping? Holy Saints!"

 Nadyezhda Filippovna felt so faint that she could not take off her hat.
      She looked about her blankly, as though she had been drugged, and
      convulsively clutched at her mother's arms.

 "What a person to trust: a porter!" said the old lady, fussing round her
      daughter and crying. "What a jealous girl you are! He is not going to
      deceive you, and how dare he? We are not just anybody. Though we are of
      the merchant class, yet he has no right, for you are his lawful wife! We
      can take proceedings! I gave twenty thousand roubles with you! You did not
      want for a dowry!"

 And the old lady herself sobbed and gesticulated, and she felt faint, too,
      and lay down on her trunk. Neither of them noticed that patches of blue
      had made their appearance in the sky, that the clouds were more
      transparent, that the first sunbeam was cautiously gliding over the wet
      grass in the garden, that with renewed gaiety the sparrows were hopping
      about the puddles which reflected the racing clouds.

 Towards evening Kvashin arrived. Before leaving town he had gone to his
      flat and had learned from the porter that his wife had come in his
      absence.

 "Here I am," he said gaily, coming into his mother-in-law's room and
      pretending not to notice their stern and tear-stained faces. "Here I am!
      It's five days since we have seen each other!"

 He rapidly kissed his wife's hand and his mother-in-law's, and with the
      air of a man delighted at having finished a difficult task, he lolled in
      an arm-chair.

 "Ough!" he said, puffing out all the air from his lungs. "Here I have been
      worried to death. I have scarcely sat down. For almost five days now I
      have been, as it were, bivouacking. I haven't been to the flat once, would
      you believe it? I have been busy the whole time with the meeting of
      Shipunov's and Ivantchikov's creditors; I had to work in Galdeyev's office
      at the shop. . . . I've had nothing to eat or to drink, and slept on a
      bench, I was chilled through . . . . I hadn't a free minute. I hadn't even
      time to go to the flat. That's how I came not to be at home, Nadyusha. . .
      And Kvashin, holding his sides as though his back were aching, glanced
      stealthily at his wife and mother-in-law to see the effect of his lie, or
      as he called it, diplomacy. The mother-in-law and wife were looking at
      each other in joyful astonishment, as though beyond all hope and
      expectation they had found something precious, which they had lost. . . .
      Their faces beamed, their eyes glowed. . . .

 "My dear man," cried the old lady, jumping up, "why am I sitting here?
      Tea! Tea at once! Perhaps you are hungry?"

 "Of course he is hungry," cried his wife, pulling off her head a bandage
      soaked in vinegar. "Mamma, bring the wine, and the savouries. Natalya, lay
      the table! Oh, my goodness, nothing is ready!"

 And both of them, frightened, happy, and bustling, ran about the room. The
      old lady could not look without laughing at her daughter who had slandered
      an innocent man, and the daughter felt ashamed. . . .

 The table was soon laid. Kvashin, who smelt of madeira and liqueurs and
      who could scarcely breathe from repletion, complained of being hungry,
      forced himself to munch and kept on talking of the meeting of Shipunov's
      and Ivantchikov's creditors, while his wife and mother-in-law could not
      take their eyes off his face, and both thought:

 "How clever and kind he is! How handsome!"

 "All serene," thought Kvashin, as he lay down on the well-filled feather
      bed. "Though they are regular tradesmen's wives, though they are
      Philistines, yet they have a charm of their own, and one can spend a day
      or two of the week here with enjoyment. . . ."

 He wrapped himself up, got warm, and as he dozed off, he said to himself:

 "All serene!"
