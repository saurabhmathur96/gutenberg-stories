The tiny old lady in the black dress and curious little black bonnet
had at first seemed alarmed at the sound made by her feet upon the
stone pavements. But later she forgot about it, for she suddenly came
into the tempest of the Sixth Avenue shopping district, where from the
streams of people and vehicles went up a roar like that from headlong
mountain torrents.

 She seemed then like a chip that catches, recoils, turns and wheels, a
reluctant thing in the clutch of the impetuous river. She hesitated,
faltered, debated with herself. Frequently she seemed about to address
people; then of a sudden she would evidently lose her courage.
Meanwhile the torrent jostled her, swung her this and that way.

 At last, however, she saw two young women gazing in at a shop-window.
They were well-dressed girls; they wore gowns with enormous sleeves
that made them look like full-rigged ships with all sails set. They
seemed to have plenty of time; they leisurely scanned the goods in the
window. Other people had made the tiny old woman much afraid because
obviously they were speeding to keep such tremendously important
engagements. She went close to the girls and peered in at the same
window. She watched them furtively for a time. Then finally she said—

 "Excuse me!"

 The girls looked down at this old face with its two large eyes turned
towards them.

 "Excuse me, can you tell me where I can get any work?"

 For an instant the two girls stared. Then they seemed about to exchange
a smile, but, at the last moment, they checked it. The tiny old lady's
eyes were upon them. She was quaintly serious, silently expectant.
She made one marvel that in that face the wrinkles showed no trace of
experience, knowledge; they were simply little, soft, innocent creases.
As for her glance, it had the trustfulness of ignorance and the candour
of babyhood.

 "I want to get something to do, because I need the money," she
continued since, in their astonishment, they had not replied to her
first question. "Of course I'm not strong and I couldn't do very much,
but I can sew well; and in a house where there was a good many men
folks, I could do all the mending. Do you know any place where they
would like me to come?"

 The young women did then exchange a smile, but it was a subtle tender
smile, the edge of personal grief.

 "Well, no, madame," hesitatingly said one of them at last; "I don't
think I know any one."

 A shade passed over the tiny old lady's face, a shadow of the wing of
disappointment.

  "Don't you?" she said, with a little struggle to be brave, in her voice.

 Then the girl hastily continued—"But if you will give me your address,
I may find some one, and if I do, I will surely let you know of it."

 The tiny old lady dictated her address, bending over to watch the girl
write on a visiting card with a little silver pencil. Then she said—

 "I thank you very much." She bowed to them, smiling, and went on down
the avenue.

 As for the two girls, they walked to the curb and watched this aged
figure, small and frail, in its black gown and curious black bonnet.
At last, the crowd, the innumerable wagons, intermingling and changing
with uproar and riot, suddenly engulfed it.

    STEPHEN CRANE'S WORKS

  THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE

 Post 8vo, cloth, 3s. net; ornamental
wrapper, 2s. 6d. net.  [PIONEER SERIES.

 The Saturday Review —"Mr. Stephen Crane's picture of the effect of
actual fighting on a raw regiment is simply unapproached in intimate
knowledge and sustained imaginative strength. In the supreme moments
of the fight he is possessed by the fiery breath of battle, and finds
an inspired utterance that will reach the universal heart of man. This
extraordinary book will appeal strongly to the insatiable desire to
know the psychology of war—how the sights and sounds, the terrible
details of the drama of battle, affect the senses and the soul of man."

 St. James's Gazette —"This is not merely a remarkable book; it is a
revelation Mr. Crane has laid the War God on the dissecting-table, and
exposed his every bone and nerve and sinew and artery to the public
gaze."

 The Speaker —"Every page is crowded, not merely with incidents such
as the war correspondent describes, but with the tragedy of life. The
reader sees the battle, not from afar, but from the inside. He hears
the laboured breathing of the wearied soldiers, sees the colour rising
and falling in their cheeks, and feels at heart as they themselves did
in this first act in the tremendous drama which so many people talk
about and so few understand.... As a work of art, The Red Badge of
Courage deserves high praise. As a moral lesson that mankind still
needs, the praise it deserves is higher still."

  THE LITTLE REGIMENT

 Post 8vo, cloth, 3s. net; ornamental
wrapper, 2s. 6d. net.  [PIONEER SERIES.

 The Athenum —"The extraordinary power of imagination is more
wonderful than that of Defoe. It is in dialogue that he is at his
strongest, for in this the words are used as the soldiers would have
used them."

  London: WILLIAM HEINEMANN, 21 Bedford Street, W.C.

    STEPHEN CRANE'S WORKS

  THE THIRD VIOLET

 Crown 8vo, cloth extra, 6s.  The Athenum —"A vividness of portraiture which puts The Third
Violet on a high level—higher, we think, than Mr. Crane's very
different Maggie , though perhaps lower than The Little Regiment ,
which is also very different. In his present book Mr. Crane is more
the rival of Mr. Henry James than of Mr. Rudyard Kipling. But he is
intensely American, which can hardly be said of Mr. Henry James, and
it is possible that if he continues in his present line of writing he
may be the author who will introduce the United States to the ordinary
English world. We have never come across a book that brought certain
sections of American society so perfectly before the reader as does The Third Violet . The picture is an extremely pleasant one, and its
truth appeals to the English reader, so that the effect of the book
is to draw him nearer to his American cousins. The Third Violet incidentally contains the best dog that we have come across in modern
fiction. Mr. Crane's dialogue is excellent, and it is dialogue of a
type for which neither The Red Badge of Courage nor his other books
had prepared us."

 The Academy —"By this latest product of his genius our
impression of Mr. Crane is confirmed: that for psychological insight, for
dramatic intensity, and for potency of phrase he is already in the front
rank of English-American writers of fiction, and that he possesses a certain
separate quality which places him apart. It is a short story and a
slender, but taking it in conjunction with what he has previously given
us, there remains, in our judgment, no room for doubt."

 The Bookman —"An idyll, and a very pretty one. In The Red
Badge of Courage and Maggie there is an intenser force; but in
this slighter effort we feel the same directness, the same true reading of the
workings of the mind, the same contempt for conventions and clap-trap
sentiment."

 The Sketch —"There is a strong human interest in it, and a boyish
vigour which is refreshing."

 The Scotsman —"It is very light, very amusing, and very
American. The literary touch is singularly deft and felicitous, the strokes
playful but unerring.... The treatment has the distinction which only a vivid
imagination, a fine dramatic faculty and an intuitive perception of the
deeper things of human nature can give to a book."

 Manchester Guardian —"It is invigorating to follow the breezy
mountain life up in the pine woods.... The book abounds in those
felicitous descriptions and bright dialogues of which Mr. Crane is
master.... One more delightful dog is added to the heroes of fiction."

 Daily Mail —"We would not for the world have it other than
it is.... In its short tantalisingly abrupt chapters, the tale gives the
history of a wooing, a history clear, simple, and often sparkling as a rill of
spring water."

  MAGGIE: A Child of the Streets

 12mo, buckram, gilt top, 2s.  The Literary World —"Contains all the force, all the power, and all
the reality which Mr. Crane has proved his pen to possess."

 1.F.

 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

 Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

 Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
