GRISHA
    

GRISHA, a chubby
      little boy, born two years and eight months ago, is walking on the
      boulevard with his nurse. He is wearing a long, wadded pelisse, a scarf, a
      big cap with a fluffy pom-pom, and warm over-boots. He feels hot and
      stifled, and now, too, the rollicking April sunshine is beating straight
      in his face, and making his eyelids tingle.
    

      The whole of his clumsy, timidly and uncertainly stepping little figure
      expresses the utmost bewilderment.
    

      Hitherto Grisha has known only a rectangular world, where in one corner
      stands his bed, in the other nurse’s trunk, in the third a chair,
      while in the fourth there is a little lamp burning. If one looks under the
      bed, one sees a doll with a broken arm and a drum; and behind nurse’s
      trunk, there are a great many things of all sorts: cotton reels, boxes
      without lids, and a broken Jack-a-dandy. In that world, besides nurse and
      Grisha, there are often mamma and the cat. Mamma is like a doll, and puss
      is like papa’s fur-coat, only the coat hasn’t got eyes and a
      tail. From the world which is called the nursery a door leads to a great
      expanse where they have dinner and tea. There stands Grisha’s chair
      on high legs, and on the wall hangs a clock which exists to swing its
      pendulum and chime. From the dining-room, one can go into a room where
      there are red arm-chairs. Here, there is a dark patch on the carpet,
      concerning which fingers are still shaken at Grisha. Beyond that room is
      still another, to which one is not admitted, and where one sees glimpses
      of papa—an extremely enigmatical person! Nurse and mamma are
      comprehensible: they dress Grisha, feed him, and put him to bed, but what
      papa exists for is unknown. There is another enigmatical person, auntie,
      who presented Grisha with a drum. She appears and disappears. Where does
      she disappear to? Grisha has more than once looked under the bed, behind
      the trunk, and under the sofa, but she was not there.
    

      In this new world, where the sun hurts one’s eyes, there are so many
      papas and mammas and aunties, that there is no knowing to whom to run. But
      what is stranger and more absurd than anything is the horses. Grisha gazes
      at their moving legs, and can make nothing of it. He looks at his nurse
      for her to solve the mystery, but she does not speak.
    

      All at once he hears a fearful tramping. . . . A crowd of soldiers, with
      red faces and bath brooms under their arms, move in step along the
      boulevard straight upon him. Grisha turns cold all over with terror, and
      looks inquiringly at nurse to know whether it is dangerous. But nurse
      neither weeps nor runs away, so there is no danger. Grisha looks after the
      soldiers, and begins to move his feet in step with them himself.
    

      Two big cats with long faces run after each other across the boulevard,
      with their tongues out, and their tails in the air. Grisha thinks that he
      must run too, and runs after the cats.
    

      “Stop!” cries nurse, seizing him roughly by the shoulder.
      “Where are you off to? Haven’t you been told not to be
      naughty?”
    

      Here there is a nurse sitting holding a tray of oranges. Grisha passes by
      her, and, without saying anything, takes an orange.
    

      “What are you doing that for?” cries the companion of his
      travels, slapping his hand and snatching away the orange. “Silly!”
    

      Now Grisha would have liked to pick up a bit of glass that was lying at
      his feet and gleaming like a lamp, but he is afraid that his hand will be
      slapped again.
    

      “My respects to you!” Grisha hears suddenly, almost above his
      ear, a loud thick voice, and he sees a tall man with bright buttons.
    

      To his great delight, this man gives nurse his hand, stops, and begins
      talking to her. The brightness of the sun, the noise of the carriages, the
      horses, the bright buttons are all so impressively new and not dreadful,
      that Grisha’s soul is filled with a feeling of enjoyment and he
      begins to laugh.
    

      “Come along! Come along!” he cries to the man with the bright
      buttons, tugging at his coattails.
    

      “Come along where?” asks the man.
    

      “Come along!” Grisha insists.
    

      He wants to say that it would be just as well to take with them papa,
      mamma, and the cat, but his tongue does not say what he wants to.
    

      A little later, nurse turns out of the boulevard, and leads Grisha into a
      big courtyard where there is still snow; and the man with the bright
      buttons comes with them too. They carefully avoid the lumps of snow and
      the puddles, then, by a dark and dirty staircase, they go into a room.
      Here there is a great deal of smoke, there is a smell of roast meat, and a
      woman is standing by the stove frying cutlets. The cook and the nurse kiss
      each other, and sit down on the bench together with the man, and begin
      talking in a low voice. Grisha, wrapped up as he is, feels insufferably
      hot and stifled.
    

      “Why is this?” he wonders, looking about him.
    

      He sees the dark ceiling, the oven fork with two horns, the stove which
      looks like a great black hole.
    

      “Mam-ma,” he drawls.
    

      “Come, come, come!” cries the nurse. “Wait a bit!”
    

      The cook puts a bottle on the table, two wine-glasses, and a pie. The two
      women and the man with the bright buttons cDlink glasses and empty them
      several times, and, the man puts his arm round first the cook and then the
      nurse. And then all three begin singing in an undertone.
    

      Grisha stretches out his hand towards the pie, and they give him a piece
      of it. He eats it and watches nurse drinking. . . . He wants to drink too.
    

      “Give me some, nurse!” he begs.
    

      The cook gives him a sip out of her glass. He rolls his eyes, bDlinks,
      coughs, and waves his hands for a long time afterwards, while the cook
      looks at him and laughs.
    

      When he gets home Grisha begins to tell mamma, the walls, and the bed
      where he has been, and what he has seen. He talks not so much with his
      tongue, as with his face and his hands. He shows how the sun shines, how
      the horses run, how the terrible stove looks, and how the cook drinks. . .
      .
    

      In the evening he cannot get to sleep. The soldiers with the brooms, the
      big cats, the horses, the bit of glass, the tray of oranges, the bright
      buttons, all gathered together, weigh on his brain. He tosses from side to
      side, babbles, and, at last, unable to endure his excitement, begins
      crying.
    

      “You are feverish,” says mamma, putting her open hand on his
      forehead. “What can have caused it?
    

      “Stove!” wails Grisha. “Go away, stove!”
    

      “He must have eaten too much . . .” mamma decides.
    

      And Grisha, shattered by the impressions of the new life he has just
      experienced, receives a spoonful of castor-oil from mamma.
