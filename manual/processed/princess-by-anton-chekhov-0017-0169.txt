THE PRINCESS

  A

CARRIAGE with
      four fine sleek horses drove in at the big so-called Red Gate of the N—-
      Monastery. While it was still at a distance, the priests and monks who
      were standing in a group round the part of the hostel allotted to the
      gentry, recognised by the coachman and horses that the lady in the
      carriage was Princess Vera Gavrilovna, whom they knew very well.

 An old man in livery jumped off the box and helped the princess to get out
      of the carriage. She raised her dark veil and moved in a leisurely way up
      to the priests to receive their blessing; then she nodded pleasantly to
      the rest of the monks and went into the hostel.

 “Well, have you missed your princess?” she said to the monk
      who brought in her things. “It’s a whole month since I’ve
      been to see you. But here I am; behold your princess. And where is the
      Father Superior? My goodness, I am burning with impatience! Wonderful,
      wonderful old man! You must be proud of having such a Superior.”

 When the Father Superior came in, the princess uttered a shriek of
      delight, crossed her arms over her bosom, and went up to receive his
      blessing.

 “No, no, let me kiss your hand,” she said, snatching it and
      eagerly kissing it three times. “How glad I am to see you at last,
      holy Father! I’m sure you’ve forgotten your princess, but my
      thoughts have been in your dear monastery every moment. How delightful it
      is here! This living for God far from the busy, giddy world has a special
      charm of its own, holy Father, which I feel with my whole soul although I
      cannot express it!”

 The princess’s cheeks glowed and tears came into her eyes. She
      talked incessantly, fervently, while the Father Superior, a grave, plain,
      shy old man of seventy, remained mute or uttered abruptly, like a soldier
      on duty, phrases such as:

 “Certainly, Your Excellency. . . . Quite so. I understand.”

 “Has Your Excellency come for a long stay?” he inquired.

 “I shall stay the night here, and to-morrow I’m going on to
      Klavdia Nikolaevna’s—it’s a long time since I’ve
      seen her—and the day after to-morrow I’ll come back to you and
      stay three or four days. I want to rest my soul here among you, holy
      Father. . . .”

 The princess liked being at the monastery at N—-. For the last two
      years it had been a favourite resort of hers; she used to go there almost
      every month in the summer and stay two or three days, even sometimes a
      week. The shy novices, the stillness, the low ceilings, the smell of
      cypress, the modest fare, the cheap curtains on the windows—all this
      touched her, softened her, and disposed her to contemplation and good
      thoughts. It was enough for her to be half an hour in the hostel for her
      to feel that she, too, was timid and modest, and that she, too, smelt of
      cypress-wood. The past retreated into the background, lost its
      significance, and the princess began to imagine that in spite of her
      twenty-nine years she was very much like the old Father Superior, and
      that, like him, she was created not for wealth, not for earthly grandeur
      and love, but for a peaceful life secluded from the world, a life in
      twilight like the hostel.

 It happens that a ray of light gleams in the dark cell of the anchorite
      absorbed in prayer, or a bird alights on the window and sings its song;
      the stern anchorite will smile in spite of himself, and a gentle, sinless
      joy will pierce through the load of grief over his sins, like water
      flowing from under a stone. The princess fancied she brought from the
      outside world just such comfort as the ray of light or the bird. Her gay,
      friendly smile, her gentle eyes, her voice, her jests, her whole
      personality in fact, her little graceful figure always dressed in simple
      black, must arouse in simple, austere people a feeling of tenderness and
      joy. Every one, looking at her, must think: “God has sent us an
      angel. . . .” And feeling that no one could help thinking this, she
      smiled still more cordially, and tried to look like a bird.

 After drinking tea and resting, she went for a walk. The sun was already
      setting. From the monastery garden came a moist fragrance of freshly
      watered mignonette, and from the church floated the soft singing of men’s
      voices, which seemed very pleasant and mournful in the distance. It was
      the evening service. In the dark windows where the little lamps glowed
      gently, in the shadows, in the figure of the old monk sitting at the
      church door with a collecting-box, there was such unruffled peace that the
      princess felt moved to tears.

 Outside the gate, in the walk between the wall and the birch-trees where
      there were benches, it was quite evening. The air grew rapidly darker and
      darker. The princess went along the walk, sat on a seat, and sank into
      thought.

 She thought how good it would be to settle down for her whole life in this
      monastery where life was as still and unruffled as a summer evening; how
      good it would be to forget the ungrateful, dissipated prince; to forget
      her immense estates, the creditors who worried her every day, her
      misfortunes, her maid Dasha, who had looked at her impertinently that
      morning. It would be nice to sit here on the bench all her life and watch
      through the trunks of the birch-trees the evening mist gathering in
      wreaths in the valley below; the rooks flying home in a black cloud like a
      veil far, far away above the forest; two novices, one astride a piebald
      horse, another on foot driving out the horses for the night and rejoicing
      in their freedom, playing pranks like little children; their youthful
      voices rang out musically in the still air, and she could distinguish
      every word. It is nice to sit and listen to the silence: at one moment the
      wind blows and stirs the tops of the birch-trees, then a frog rustles in
      last year’s leaves, then the clock on the belfry strikes the
      quarter. . . . One might sit without moving, listen and think, and think.
      . . .

 An old woman passed by with a wallet on her back. The princess thought
      that it would be nice to stop the old woman and to say something friendly
      and cordial to her, to help her. . . . But the old woman turned the corner
      without once looking round.

 Not long afterwards a tall man with a grey beard and a straw hat came
      along the walk. When he came up to the princess, he took off his hat and
      bowed. From the bald patch on his head and his sharp, hooked nose the
      princess recognised him as the doctor, Mihail Ivanovitch, who had been in
      her service at Dubovki. She remembered that some one had told her that his
      wife had died the year before, and she wanted to sympathise with him, to
      console him.

 “Doctor, I expect you don’t recognise me?” she said with
      an affable smile.

 “Yes, Princess, I recognised you,” said the doctor, taking off
      his hat again.

 “Oh, thank you; I was afraid that you, too, had forgotten your
      princess. People only remember their enemies, but they forget their
      friends. Have you, too, come to pray?”

 “I am the doctor here, and I have to spend the night at the
      monastery every Saturday.”

 “Well, how are you?” said the princess, sighing. “I hear
      that you have lost your wife. What a calamity!”

 “Yes, Princess, for me it is a great calamity.”

 “There’s nothing for it! We must bear our troubles with
      resignation. Not one hair of a man’s head is lost without the Divine
      Will.”

 “Yes, Princess.”

 To the princess’s friendly, gentle smile and her sighs the doctor
      responded coldly and dryly: “Yes, Princess.” And the
      expression of his face was cold and dry.

 “What else can I say to him?” she wondered.

 “How long it is since we met!” she said. “Five years!
      How much water has flowed under the bridge, how many changes in that time;
      it quite frightens one to think of it! You know, I am married. . . . I am
      not a countess now, but a princess. And by now I am separated from my
      husband too.”

 “Yes, I heard so.”

 “God has sent me many trials. No doubt you have heard, too, that I
      am almost ruined. My Dubovki, Sofyino, and Kiryakovo have all been sold
      for my unhappy husband’s debts. And I have only Baranovo and
      Mihaltsevo left. It’s terrible to look back: how many changes and
      misfortunes of all kinds, how many mistakes!”

 “Yes, Princess, many mistakes.”

 The princess was a little disconcerted. She knew her mistakes; they were
      all of such a private character that no one but she could think or speak
      of them. She could not resist asking:

 “What mistakes are you thinking about?”

 “You referred to them, so you know them . . .” answered the
      doctor, and he smiled. “Why talk about them!”

 “No; tell me, doctor. I shall be very grateful to you. And please
      don’t stand on ceremony with me. I love to hear the truth.”

 “I am not your judge, Princess.”

 “Not my judge! What a tone you take! You must know something about
      me. Tell me!”

 “If you really wish it, very well. Only I regret to say I’m
      not clever at talking, and people can’t always understand me.”

 The doctor thought a moment and began:

 “A lot of mistakes; but the most important of them, in my opinion,
      was the general spirit that prevailed on all your estates. You see, I don’t
      know how to express myself. I mean chiefly the lack of love, the aversion
      for people that was felt in absolutely everything. Your whole system of
      life was built upon that aversion. Aversion for the human voice, for
      faces, for heads, steps . . . in fact, for everything that makes up a
      human being. At all the doors and on the stairs there stand sleek, rude,
      and lazy grooms in livery to prevent badly dressed persons from entering
      the house; in the hall there are chairs with high backs so that the
      footmen waiting there, during balls and receptions, may not soil the walls
      with their heads; in every room there are thick carpets that no human step
      may be heard; every one who comes in is infallibly warned to speak as
      softly and as little as possible, and to say nothing that might have a
      disagreeable effect on the nerves or the imagination. And in your room you
      don’t shake hands with any one or ask him to sit down— just as
      you didn’t shake hands with me or ask me to sit down. . . .”

 “By all means, if you like,” said the princess, smiling and
      holding out her hand. “Really, to be cross about such trifles. . . .”

 “But I am not cross,” laughed the doctor, but at once he
      flushed, took off his hat, and waving it about, began hotly: “To be
      candid, I’ve long wanted an opportunity to tell you all I think. . .
      . That is, I want to tell you that you look upon the mass of mankind from
      the Napoleonic standpoint as food for the cannon. But Napoleon had at
      least some idea; you have nothing except aversion.”

 “I have an aversion for people?” smiled the princess,
      shrugging her shoulders in astonishment. “I have!”

 “Yes, you! You want facts? By all means. In Mihaltsevo three former
      cooks of yours, who have gone blind in your kitchens from the heat of the
      stove, are living upon charity. All the health and strength and good looks
      that is found on your hundreds of thousands of acres is taken by you and
      your parasites for your grooms, your footmen, and your coachmen. All these
      two-legged cattle are trained to be flunkeys, overeat themselves, grow
      coarse, lose the ‘image and likeness,’ in fact. . . . Young
      doctors, agricultural experts, teachers, intellectual workers generally—think
      of it!—are torn away from their honest work and forced for a crust
      of bread to take part in all sorts of mummeries which make every decent
      man feel ashamed! Some young men cannot be in your service for three years
      without becoming hypocrites, toadies, sneaks. . . . Is that a good thing?
      Your Polish superintendents, those abject spies, all those Kazimers and
      Kaetans, go hunting about on your hundreds of thousands of acres from
      morning to night, and to please you try to get three skins off one ox.
      Excuse me, I speak disconnectedly, but that doesn’t matter. You don’t
      look upon the simple people as human beings. And even the princes, counts,
      and bishops who used to come and see you, you looked upon simply as
      decorative figures, not as living beings. But the worst of all, the thing
      that most revolts me, is having a fortune of over a million and doing
      nothing for other people, nothing!”

 The princess sat amazed, aghast, offended, not knowing what to say or how
      to behave. She had never before been spoken to in such a tone. The doctor’s
      unpleasant, angry voice and his clumsy, faltering phrases made a harsh
      clattering noise in her ears and her head. Then she began to feel as
      though the gesticulating doctor was hitting her on the head with his hat.

 “It’s not true!” she articulated softly, in an imploring
      voice. “I’ve done a great deal of good for other people; you
      know it yourself!”

 “Nonsense!” cried the doctor. “Can you possibly go on
      thinking of your philanthropic work as something genuine and useful, and
      not a mere mummery? It was a farce from beginning to end; it was playing
      at loving your neighbour, the most open farce which even children and
      stupid peasant women saw through! Take for instance your— what was
      it called?—house for homeless old women without relations, of which
      you made me something like a head doctor, and of which you were the
      patroness. Mercy on us! What a charming institution it was! A house was
      built with parquet floors and a weathercock on the roof; a dozen old women
      were collected from the villages and made to sleep under blankets and
      sheets of Dutch linen, and given toffee to eat.”

 The doctor gave a malignant chuckle into his hat, and went on speaking
      rapidly and stammering:

 “It was a farce! The attendants kept the sheets and the blankets
      under lock and key, for fear the old women should soil them—‘Let
      the old devil’s pepper-pots sleep on the floor.’ The old women
      did not dare to sit down on the beds, to put on their jackets, to walk
      over the polished floors. Everything was kept for show and hidden away
      from the old women as though they were thieves, and the old women were
      clothed and fed on the sly by other people’s charity, and prayed to
      God night and day to be released from their prison and from the canting
      exhortations of the sleek rascals to whose care you committed them. And
      what did the managers do? It was simply charming! About twice a week there
      would be thirty-five thousand messages to say that the princess—that
      is, you—were coming to the home next day. That meant that next day I
      had to abandon my patients, dress up and be on parade. Very good; I
      arrive. The old women, in everything clean and new, are already drawn up
      in a row, waiting. Near them struts the old garrison rat—the
      superintendent with his mawkish, sneaking smile. The old women yawn and
      exchange glances, but are afraid to complain. We wait. The junior steward
      gallops up. Half an hour later the senior steward; then the superintendent
      of the accounts’ office, then another, and then another of them . .
      . they keep arriving endlessly. They all have mysterious, solemn faces. We
      wait and wait, shift from one leg to another, look at the clock—all
      this in monumental silence because we all hate each other like poison. One
      hour passes, then a second, and then at last the carriage is seen in the
      distance, and . . . and . . .”

 The doctor went off into a shrill laugh and brought out in a shrill voice:

 “You get out of the carriage, and the old hags, at the word of
      command from the old garrison rat, begin chanting: ‘The Glory of our
      Lord in Zion the tongue of man cannot express. . .’ A pretty scene,
      wasn’t it?”

 The doctor went off into a bass chuckle, and waved his hand as though to
      signify that he could not utter another word for laughing. He laughed
      heavily, harshly, with clenched teeth, as ill-natured people laugh; and
      from his voice, from his face, from his glittering, rather insolent eyes
      it could be seen that he had a profound contempt for the princess, for the
      home, and for the old women. There was nothing amusing or laughable in all
      that he described so clumsily and coarsely, but he laughed with
      satisfaction, even with delight.

 “And the school?” he went on, panting from laughter. “Do
      you remember how you wanted to teach peasant children yourself? You must
      have taught them very well, for very soon the children all ran away, so
      that they had to be thrashed and bribed to come and be taught. And you
      remember how you wanted to feed with your own hands the infants whose
      mothers were working in the fields. You went about the village crying
      because the infants were not at your disposal, as the mothers would take
      them to the fields with them. Then the village foreman ordered the mothers
      by turns to leave their infants behind for your entertainment. A strange
      thing! They all ran away from your benevolence like mice from a cat! And
      why was it? It’s very simple. Not because our people are ignorant
      and ungrateful, as you always explained it to yourself, but because in all
      your fads, if you’ll excuse the word, there wasn’t a ha’p’orth
      of love and kindness! There was nothing but the desire to amuse yourself
      with living puppets, nothing else. . . . A person who does not feel the
      difference between a human being and a lap-dog ought not to go in for
      philanthropy. I assure you, there’s a great difference between human
      beings and lap-dogs!”

 The princess’s heart was beating dreadfully; there was a thudding in
      her ears, and she still felt as though the doctor were beating her on the
      head with his hat. The doctor talked quickly, excitedly, and uncouthly,
      stammering and gesticulating unnecessarily. All she grasped was that she
      was spoken to by a coarse, ill-bred, spiteful, and ungrateful man; but
      what he wanted of her and what he was talking about, she could not
      understand.

 “Go away!” she said in a tearful voice, putting up her hands
      to protect her head from the doctor’s hat; “go away!”

 “And how you treat your servants!” the doctor went on,
      indignantly. “You treat them as the lowest scoundrels, and don’t
      look upon them as human beings. For example, allow me to ask, why did you
      dismiss me? For ten years I worked for your father and afterwards for you,
      honestly, without vacations or holidays. I gained the love of all for more
      than seventy miles round, and suddenly one fine day I am informed that I
      am no longer wanted. What for? I’ve no idea to this day. I, a doctor
      of medicine, a gentleman by birth, a student of the Moscow University,
      father of a family—am such a petty, insignificant insect that you
      can kick me out without explaining the reason! Why stand on ceremony with
      me! I heard afterwards that my wife went without my knowledge three times
      to intercede with you for me—you wouldn’t receive her. I am
      told she cried in your hall. And I shall never forgive her for it, never!”

 The doctor paused and clenched his teeth, making an intense effort to
      think of something more to say, very unpleasant and vindictive. He thought
      of something, and his cold, frowning face suddenly brightened.

 “Take your attitude to this monastery!” he said with avidity.
      “You’ve never spared any one, and the holier the place, the
      more chance of its suffering from your loving-kindness and angelic
      sweetness. Why do you come here? What do you want with the monks here,
      allow me to ask you? What is Hecuba to you or you to Hecuba? It’s
      another farce, another amusement for you, another sacrilege against human
      dignity, and nothing more. Why, you don’t believe in the monks’
      God; you’ve a God of your own in your heart, whom you’ve
      evolved for yourself at spiritualist séances. You look with condescension
      upon the ritual of the Church; you don’t go to mass or vespers; you
      sleep till midday. . . . Why do you come here? . . . You come with a God
      of your own into a monastery you have nothing to do with, and you imagine
      that the monks look upon it as a very great honour. To be sure they do!
      You’d better ask, by the way, what your visits cost the monastery.
      You were graciously pleased to arrive here this evening, and a messenger
      from your estate arrived on horseback the day before yesterday to warn
      them of your coming. They were the whole day yesterday getting the rooms
      ready and expecting you. This morning your advance-guard arrived—an
      insolent maid, who keeps running across the courtyard, rustling her
      skirts, pestering them with questions, giving orders. . . . I can’t
      endure it! The monks have been on the lookout all day, for if you were not
      met with due ceremony, there would be trouble! You’d complain to the
      bishop! ‘The monks don’t like me, your holiness; I don’t
      know what I’ve done to displease them. It’s true I’m a
      great sinner, but I’m so unhappy!’ Already one monastery has
      been in hot water over you. The Father Superior is a busy, learned man; he
      hasn’t a free moment, and you keep sending for him to come to your
      rooms. Not a trace of respect for age or for rank! If at least you were a
      bountiful giver to the monastery, one wouldn’t resent it so much,
      but all this time the monks have not received a hundred roubles from you!”

 Whenever people worried the princess, misunderstood her, or mortified her,
      and when she did not know what to say or do, she usually began to cry. And
      on this occasion, too, she ended by hiding her face in her hands and
      crying aloud in a thin treble like a child. The doctor suddenly stopped
      and looked at her. His face darkened and grew stern.

 “Forgive me, Princess,” he said in a hollow voice. “I’ve
      given way to a malicious feeling and forgotten myself. It was not right.”

 And coughing in an embarrassed way, he walked away quickly, without
      remembering to put his hat on.

 Stars were already twinkling in the sky. The moon must have been rising on
      the further side of the monastery, for the sky was clear, soft, and
      transparent. Bats were flitting noiselessly along the white monastery
      wall.

 The clock slowly struck three quarters, probably a quarter to nine. The
      princess got up and walked slowly to the gate. She felt wounded and was
      crying, and she felt that the trees and the stars and even the bats were
      pitying her, and that the clock struck musically only to express its
      sympathy with her. She cried and thought how nice it would be to go into a
      monastery for the rest of her life. On still summer evenings she would
      walk alone through the avenues, insulted, injured, misunderstood by
      people, and only God and the starry heavens would see the martyr’s
      tears. The evening service was still going on in the church. The princess
      stopped and listened to the singing; how beautiful the singing sounded in
      the still darkness! How sweet to weep and suffer to the sound of that
      singing!

 Going into her rooms, she looked at her tear-stained face in the glass and
      powdered it, then she sat down to supper. The monks knew that she liked
      pickled sturgeon, little mushrooms, Malaga and plain honey-cakes that left
      a taste of cypress in the mouth, and every time she came they gave her all
      these dishes. As she ate the mushrooms and drank the Malaga, the princess
      dreamed of how she would be finally ruined and deserted—how all her
      stewards, bailiffs, clerks, and maid-servants for whom she had done so
      much, would be false to her, and begin to say rude things; how people all
      the world over would set upon her, speak ill of her, jeer at her. She
      would renounce her title, would renounce society and luxury, and would go
      into a convent without one word of reproach to any one; she would pray for
      her enemies—and then they would all understand her and come to beg
      her forgiveness, but by that time it would be too late. . . .

 After supper she knelt down in the corner before the ikon and read two
      chapters of the Gospel. Then her maid made her bed and she got into it.
      Stretching herself under the white quilt, she heaved a sweet, deep sigh,
      as one sighs after crying, closed her eyes, and began to fall asleep.

 In the morning she waked up and glanced at her watch. It was half-past
      nine. On the carpet near the bed was a bright, narrow streak of sunlight
      from a ray which came in at the window and dimly lighted up the room.
      Flies were buzzing behind the black curtain at the window. “It’s
      early,” thought the princess, and she closed her eyes.

 Stretching and lying snug in her bed, she recalled her meeting yesterday
      with the doctor and all the thoughts with which she had gone to sleep the
      night before: she remembered she was unhappy. Then she thought of her
      husband living in Petersburg, her stewards, doctors, neighbours, the
      officials of her acquaintance . . . a long procession of familiar
      masculine faces passed before her imagination. She smiled and thought, if
      only these people could see into her heart and understand her, they would
      all be at her feet.

 At a quarter past eleven she called her maid.

 “Help me to dress, Dasha,” she said languidly. “But go
      first and tell them to get out the horses. I must set off for Klavdia
      Nikolaevna’s.”

 Going out to get into the carriage, she bGlinked at the glaring daylight
      and laughed with pleasure: it was a wonderfully fine day! As she scanned
      from her half-closed eyes the monks who had gathered round the steps to
      see her off, she nodded graciously and said:

 “Good-bye, my friends! Till the day after tomorrow.”

 It was an agreeable surprise to her that the doctor was with the monks by
      the steps. His face was pale and severe.

 “Princess,” he said with a guilty smile, taking off his hat,
      “I’ve been waiting here a long time to see you. Forgive me,
      for God’s sake. . . . I was carried away yesterday by an evil,
      vindictive feeling and I talked . . . nonsense. In short, I beg your
      pardon.”

 The princess smiled graciously, and held out her hand for him to kiss. He
      kissed it, turning red.

      nodded in all directions. There was a gay, warm, serene feeling in her

      the dusty road past huts and gardens, past long trains of waggons and
      strings of pilgrims on their way to the monastery, she still screwed up
      her eyes and smiled softly. She was thinking there was no higher bliss
      than to bring warmth, light, and joy wherever one went, to forgive
      injuries, to smile graciously on one’s enemies. The peasants she
      passed bowed to her, the carriage rustled softly, clouds of dust rose from
      under the wheels and floated over the golden rye, and it seemed to the
      princess that her body was swaying not on carriage cushions but on clouds,
      and that she herself was like a light, transparent little cloud. . . .

      happy I am!”
