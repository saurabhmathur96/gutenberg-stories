A LADY’S STORY
    

NINE years ago
      Pyotr Sergeyitch, the deputy prosecutor, and I were riding towards evening
      in hay-making time to fetch the letters from the station.
    

      The weather was magnificent, but on our way back we heard a peal of
      thunder, and saw an angry black storm-cloud which was coming straight
      towards us. The storm-cloud was approaching us and we were approaching it.
    

      Against the background of it our house and church looked white and the
      tall poplars shone like silver. There was a scent of rain and mown hay. My
      companion was in high spirits. He kept laughing and talking all sorts of
      nonsense. He said it would be nice if we could suddenly come upon a
      medieval castle with turreted towers, with moss on it and owls, in which
      we could take shelter from the rain and in the end be killed by a
      thunderbolt....
    

      Then the first wave raced through the rye and a field of oats, there was a
      gust of wind, and the dust flew round and round in the air. Pyotr
      Sergeyitch laughed and spurred on his horse.
    

      “It’s fine!” he cried, “it’s splendid!”
    

      Infected by his gaiety, I too began laughing at the thought that in a
      minute I should be drenched to the skin and might be struck by lightning.
    

      Riding swiftly in a hurricane when one is breathless with the wind, and
      feels like a bird, thrills one and puts one’s heart in a flutter. By
      the time we rode into our courtyard the wind had gone down, and big drops
      of rain were pattering on the grass and on the roofs. There was not a soul
      near the stable.
    

      Pyotr Sergeyitch himself took the bridles off, and led the horses to their
      stalls. I stood in the doorway waiting for him to finish, and watching the
      slanting streaks of rain; the sweetish, exciting scent of hay was even
      stronger here than in the fields; the storm-clouds and the rain made it
      almost twilight.
    

      “What a crash!” said Pyotr Sergeyitch, coming up to me after a
      very loud rolling peal of thunder when it seemed as though the sky were
      split in two. “What do you say to that?”
    

      He stood beside me in the doorway and, still breathless from his rapid
      ride, looked at me. I could see that he was admiring me.
    

      “Natalya Vladimirovna,” he said, “I would give anything
      only to stay here a little longer and look at you. You are lovely to-day.”
    

      His eyes looked at me with delight and supplication, his face was pale. On
      his beard and mustache were glittering raindrops, and they, too, seemed to
      be looking at me with love.
    

      “I love you,” he said. “I love you, and I am happy at
      seeing you. I know you cannot be my wife, but I want nothing, I ask
      nothing; only know that I love you. Be silent, do not answer me, take no
      notice of it, but only know that you are dear to me and let me look at
      you.”
    

      His rapture affected me too; I looked at his enthusiastic face, listened
      to his voice which mingled with the patter of the rain, and stood as
      though spellbound, unable to stir.
    

      I longed to go on endlessly looking at his shining eyes and listening.
    

      “You say nothing, and that is splendid,” said Pyotr
      Sergeyitch. “Go on being silent.”
    

      I felt happy. I laughed with delight and ran through the drenching rain to
      the house; he laughed too, and, leaping as he went, ran after me.
    

      Both drenched, panting, noisily clattering up the stairs like children, we
      dashed into the room. My father and brother, who were not used to seeing
      me laughing and light-hearted, looked at me in surprise and began laughing
      too.
    

      The storm-clouds had passed over and the thunder had ceased, but the
      raindrops still glittered on Pyotr Sergeyitch’s beard. The whole
      evening till supper-time he was singing, whistling, playing noisily with
      the dog and racing about the room after it, so that he nearly upset the
      servant with the samovar. And at supper he ate a great deal, talked
      nonsense, and maintained that when one eats fresh cucumbers in winter
      there is the fragrance of spring in one’s mouth.
    

      When I went to bed I lighted a candle and threw my window wide open, and
      an undefined feeling took possession of my soul. I remembered that I was
      free and healthy, that I had rank and wealth, that I was beloved; above
      all, that I had rank and wealth, rank and wealth, my God! how nice that
      was!... Then, huddling up in bed at a touch of cold which reached me from
      the garden with the dew, I tried to discover whether I loved Pyotr
      Sergeyitch or not,... and fell asleep unable to reach any conclusion.
    

      And when in the morning I saw quivering patches of sunlight and the
      shadows of the lime trees on my bed, what had happened yesterday rose
      vividly in my memory. Life seemed to me rich, varied, full of charm.
      Humming, I dressed quickly and went out into the garden....
    

      And what happened afterwards? Why—nothing. In the winter when we
      lived in town Pyotr Sergeyitch came to see us from time to time. Country
      acquaintances are charming only in the country and in summer; in the town
      and in winter they lose their charm. When you pour out tea for them in the
      town it seems as though they are wearing other people’s coats, and
      as though they stirred their tea too long. In the town, too, Pyotr
      Sergeyitch spoke sometimes of love, but the effect was not at all the same
      as in the country. In the town we were more vividly conscious of the wall
      that stood between us. I had rank and wealth, while he was poor, and he
      was not even a nobleman, but only the son of a deacon and a deputy public
      prosecutor; we both of us—I through my youth and he for some unknown
      reason—thought of that wall as very high and thick, and when he was
      with us in the town he would criticize aristocratic society with a forced
      smile, and maintain a sullen silence when there was anyone else in the
      drawing-room. There is no wall that cannot be broken through, but the
      heroes of the modern romance, so far as I know them, are too timid,
      spiritless, lazy, and oversensitive, and are too ready to resign
      themselves to the thought that they are doomed to failure, that personal
      life has disappointed them; instead of struggling they merely criticize,
      calling the world vulgar and forgetting that their criticism passes little
      by little into vulgarity.
    

      I was loved, happiness was not far away, and seemed to be almost touching
      me; I went on living in careless ease without trying to understand myself,
      not knowing what I expected or what I wanted from life, and time went on
      and on.... People passed by me with their love, bright days and warm
      nights flashed by, the nightingales sang, the hay smelt fragrant, and all
      this, sweet and overwhelming in remembrance, passed with me as with
      everyone rapidly, leaving no trace, was not prized, and vanished like
      mist.... Where is it all?
    

      My father is dead, I have grown older; everything that delighted me,
      caressed me, gave me hope—the patter of the rain, the rolling of the
      thunder, thoughts of happiness, talk of love—all that has become
      nothing but a memory, and I see before me a flat desert distance; on the
      plain not one living soul, and out there on the horizon it is dark and
      terrible....
    

      A ring at the bell.... It is Pyotr Sergeyitch. When in the winter I see
      the trees and remember how green they were for me in the summer I whisper:
    

      “Oh, my darlings!”
    

      And when I see people with whom I spent my spring-time, I feel sorrowful
      and warm and whisper the same thing.
    

      He has long ago by my father’s good offices been transferred to
      town. He looks a little older, a little fallen away. He has long given up
      declaring his love, has left off talking nonsense, dislikes his official
      work, is ill in some way and disillusioned; he has given up trying to get
      anything out of life, and takes no interest in living. Now he has sat down
      by the hearth and looks in silence at the fire....
    

      Not knowing what to say I ask him:
    

      “Well, what have you to tell me?”
    

      “Nothing,” he answers.
    

      And silence again. The red glow of the fire plays about his melancholy
      face.
    

      I thought of the past, and all at once my shoulders began quivering, my
      head dropped, and I began weeping bitterly. I felt unbearably sorry for
      myself and for this man, and passionately longed for what had passed away
      and what life refused us now. And now I did not think about rank and
      wealth.
    

      I broke into loud sobs, pressing my temples, and muttered:
    

      “My God! my God! my life is wasted!”
    

      And he sat and was silent, and did not say to me: “Don’t weep.”
      He understood that I must weep, and that the time for this had come.
    

      I saw from his eyes that he was sorry for me; and I was sorry for him,
      too, and vexed with this timid, unsuccessful man who could not make a life
      for me, nor for himself.
    

      When I saw him to the door, he was, I fancied, purposely a long while
      putting on his coat. Twice he kissed my hand without a word, and looked a
      long while into my tear-stained face. I believe at that moment he recalled
      the storm, the streaks of rain, our laughter, my face that day; he longed
      to say something to me, and he would have been glad to say it; but he said
      nothing, he merely shook his head and pressed my hand. God help him!
    

      After seeing him out, I went back to my study and again sat on the carpet
      before the fireplace; the red embers were covered with ash and began to
      grow dim. The frost tapped still more angrily at the windows, and the wind
      droned in the chimney.
    

      The maid came in and, thinking I was asleep, called my name.
