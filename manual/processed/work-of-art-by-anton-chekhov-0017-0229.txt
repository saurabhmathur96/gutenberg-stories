A WORK OF ART

  S

ASHA SMIRNOV, the
      only son of his mother, holding under his arm, something wrapped up in No.
      223 of the Financial News , assumed a sentimental expression, and
      went into Dr. Koshelkov’s consulting-room.

 “Ah, dear lad!” was how the doctor greeted him. “Well!
      how are we feeling? What good news have you for me?”

 Sasha bKlinked, laid his hand on his heart and said in an agitated voice:
      “Mamma sends her greetings to you, Ivan Nikolaevitch, and told me to
      thank you. . . . I am the only son of my mother and you have saved my life
      . . . you have brought me through a dangerous illness and . . . we do not
      know how to thank you.”

 “Nonsense, lad!” said the doctor, highly delighted. “I
      only did what anyone else would have done in my place.”

 “I am the only son of my mother . . . we are poor people and cannot
      of course repay you, and we are quite ashamed, doctor, although, however,
      mamma and I . . . the only son of my mother, earnestly beg you to accept
      in token of our gratitude . . . this object, which . . . An object of
      great value, an antique bronze. . . . A rare work of art.”

 “You shouldn’t!” said the doctor, frowning. “What’s
      this for!”

 “No, please do not refuse,” Sasha went on muttering as he
      unpacked the parcel. “You will wound mamma and me by refusing. . . .
      It’s a fine thing . . . an antique bronze. . . . It was left us by
      my deceased father and we have kept it as a precious souvenir. My father
      used to buy antique bronzes and sell them to connoisseurs . . . Mamma and
      I keep on the business now.”

 Sasha undid the object and put it solemnly on the table. It was a not very
      tall candelabra of old bronze and artistic workmanship. It consisted of a
      group: on the pedestal stood two female figures in the costume of Eve and
      in attitudes for the description of which I have neither the courage nor
      the fitting temperament. The figures were smiling coquettishly and
      altogether looked as though, had it not been for the necessity of
      supporting the candlestick, they would have skipped off the pedestal and
      have indulged in an orgy such as is improper for the reader even to
      imagine.

 Looking at the present, the doctor slowly scratched behind his ear,
      cleared his throat and blew his nose irresolutely.

 “Yes, it certainly is a fine thing,” he muttered, “but .
      . . how shall I express it? . . . it’s . . . h’m . . . it’s
      not quite for family reading. It’s not simply decolleté but beyond
      anything, dash it all. . . .”

 “How do you mean?”

 “The serpent-tempter himself could not have invented anything worse
      . . . . Why, to put such a phantasmagoria on the table would be defiling
      the whole flat.”

 “What a strange way of looking at art, doctor!” said Sasha,
      offended. “Why, it is an artistic thing, look at it! There is so
      much beauty and elegance that it fills one’s soul with a feeling of
      reverence and brings a lump into one’s throat! When one sees
      anything so beautiful one forgets everything earthly. . . . Only look, how
      much movement, what an atmosphere, what expression!”

 “I understand all that very well, my dear boy,” the doctor
      interposed, “but you know I am a family man, my children run in
      here, ladies come in.”

 “Of course if you look at it from the point of view of the crowd,”
      said Sasha, “then this exquisitely artistic work may appear in a
      certain light. . . . But, doctor, rise superior to the crowd, especially
      as you will wound mamma and me by refusing it. I am the only son of my
      mother, you have saved my life. . . . We are giving you the thing most
      precious to us and . . . and I only regret that I have not the pair to
      present to you. . . .”

 “Thank you, my dear fellow, I am very grateful . . . Give my
      respects to your mother but really consider, my children run in here,
      ladies come. . . . However, let it remain! I see there’s no arguing
      with you.”

 “And there is nothing to argue about,” said Sasha, relieved.
      “Put the candlestick here, by this vase. What a pity we have not the
      pair to it! It is a pity! Well, good-bye, doctor.”

 After Sasha’s departure the doctor looked for a long time at the
      candelabra, scratched behind his ear and meditated.

 “It’s a superb thing, there’s no denying it,” he
      thought, “and it would be a pity to throw it away. . . . But it’s
      impossible for me to keep it. . . . H’m! . . . Here’s a
      problem! To whom can I make a present of it, or to what charity can I give
      it?”

 After long meditation he thought of his good friend, the lawyer Uhov, to
      whom he was indebted for the management of legal business.

 “Excellent,” the doctor decided, “it would be awkward
      for him as a friend to take money from me, and it will be very suitable
      for me to present him with this. I will take him the devilish thing!
      Luckily he is a bachelor and easy-going.”

 Without further procrastination the doctor put on his hat and coat, took
      the candelabra and went off to Uhov’s.

 “How are you, friend!” he said, finding the lawyer at home.
      “I’ve come to see you . . . to thank you for your efforts. . .
      . You won’t take money so you must at least accept this thing here.
      . . . See, my dear fellow. . . . The thing is magnificent!”

 On seeing the bronze the lawyer was moved to indescribable delight.

 “What a specimen!” he chuckled. “Ah, deuce take it, to
      think of them imagining such a thing, the devils! Exquisite! Ravishing!
      Where did you get hold of such a delightful thing?”

 After pouring out his ecstasies the lawyer looked timidly towards the door
      and said: “Only you must carry off your present, my boy . . . . I
      can’t take it. . . .”

 “Why?” cried the doctor, disconcerted.

 “Why . . . because my mother is here at times, my clients . . .
      besides I should be ashamed for my servants to see it.”

 “Nonsense! Nonsense! Don’t you dare to refuse!” said the
      doctor, gesticulating. “It’s piggish of you! It’s a work
      of art! . . . What movement . . . what expression! I won’t even talk
      of it! You will offend me!”

 “If one could plaster it over or stick on fig-leaves . . .”

 But the doctor gesticulated more violently than before, and dashing out of
      the flat went home, glad that he had succeeded in getting the present off
      his hands.

 When he had gone away the lawyer examined the candelabra, fingered it all
      over, and then, like the doctor, racked his brains over the question what
      to do with the present.

 “It’s a fine thing,” he mused, “and it would be a
      pity to throw it away and improper to keep it. The very best thing would
      be to make a present of it to someone. . . . I know what! I’ll take
      it this evening to Shashkin, the comedian. The rascal is fond of such
      things, and by the way it is his benefit tonight.”

 No sooner said than done. In the evening the candelabra, carefully wrapped
      up, was duly carried to Shashkin’s. The whole evening the comic
      actor’s dressing-room was besieged by men coming to admire the
      present; the dressing-room was filled with the hum of enthusiasm and
      laughter like the neighing of horses. If one of the actresses approached
      the door and asked: “May I come in?” the comedian’s
      husky voice was heard at once: “No, no, my dear, I am not dressed!”

 After the performance the comedian shrugged his shoulders, flung up his
      hands and said: “Well what am I to do with the horrid thing? Why, I
      live in a private flat! Actresses come and see me! It’s not a
      photograph that you can put in a drawer!”

 “You had better sell it, sir,” the hairdresser who was
      disrobing the actor advised him. “There’s an old woman living
      about here who buys antique bronzes. Go and enquire for Madame Smirnov . .
      . everyone knows her.”

 The actor followed his advice. . . . Two days later the doctor was sitting
      in his consulting-room, and with his finger to his brow was meditating on
      the acids of the bile. All at once the door opened and Sasha Smirnov flew
      into the room. He was smiling, beaming, and his whole figure was radiant
      with happiness. In his hands he held something wrapped up in newspaper.

 “Doctor!” he began breathlessly, “imagine my delight!
      Happily for you we have succeeded in picking up the pair to your
      candelabra! Mamma is so happy. . . . I am the only son of my mother, you
      saved my life. . . .”

 And Sasha, all of a tremor with gratitude, set the candelabra before the
      doctor. The doctor opened his mouth, tried to say something, but said
      nothing: he could not speak.
