LOVE

  “T

HREE o’clock
      in the morning. The soft April night is looking in at my windows and
      caressingly winking at me with its stars. I can’t sleep, I am so
      happy!

 “My whole being from head to heels is bursting with a strange,
      incomprehensible feeling. I can’t analyse it just now—I haven’t
      the time, I’m too lazy, and there—hang analysis! Why, is a man
      likely to interpret his sensations when he is flying head foremost from a
      belfry, or has just learned that he has won two hundred thousand? Is he in
      a state to do it?”

 This was more or less how I began my love-letter to Sasha, a girl of
      nineteen with whom I had fallen in love. I began it five times, and as
      often tore up the sheets, scratched out whole pages, and copied it all
      over again. I spent as long over the letter as if it had been a novel I
      had to write to order. And it was not because I tried to make it longer,
      more elaborate, and more fervent, but because I wanted endlessly to
      prolong the process of this writing, when one sits in the stillness of one’s
      study and communes with one’s own day-dreams while the spring night
      looks in at one’s window. Between the lines I saw a beloved image,
      and it seemed to me that there were, sitting at the same table writing
      with me, spirits as naïvely happy, as foolish, and as blissfully smiling
      as I. I wrote continually, looking at my hand, which still ached
      deliciously where hers had lately pressed it, and if I turned my eyes away
      I had a vision of the green trellis of the little gate. Through that
      trellis Sasha gazed at me after I had said goodbye to her. When I was
      saying good-bye to Sasha I was thinking of nothing and was simply admiring
      her figure as every decent man admires a pretty woman; when I saw through
      the trellis two big eyes, I suddenly, as though by inspiration, knew that
      I was in love, that it was all settled between us, and fully decided
      already, that I had nothing left to do but to carry out certain
      formalities.

 It is a great delight also to seal up a love-letter, and, slowly putting
      on one’s hat and coat, to go softly out of the house and to carry
      the treasure to the post. There are no stars in the sky now: in their
      place there is a long whitish streak in the east, broken here and there by
      clouds above the roofs of the dingy houses; from that streak the whole sky
      is flooded with pale light. The town is asleep, but already the
      water-carts have come out, and somewhere in a far-away factory a whistle
      sounds to wake up the workpeople. Beside the postbox, slightly moist with
      dew, you are sure to see the clumsy figure of a house porter, wearing a
      bell-shaped sheepskin and carrying a stick. He is in a condition akin to
      catalepsy: he is not asleep or awake, but something between.

 If the boxes knew how often people resort to them for the decision of
      their fate, they would not have such a humble air. I, anyway, almost
      kissed my postbox, and as I gazed at it I reflected that the post is the
      greatest of blessings.

 I beg anyone who has ever been in love to remember how one usually hurries
      home after dropping the letter in the box, rapidly gets into bed and pulls
      up the quilt in the full conviction that as soon as one wakes up in the
      morning one will be overwhelmed with memories of the previous day and look
      with rapture at the window, where the daylight will be eagerly making its
      way through the folds of the curtain.

 Well, to facts. . . . Next morning at midday, Sasha’s maid brought
      me the following answer: “I am delited be sure to come to us to day
      please I shall expect you. Your S.”

 Not a single comma. This lack of punctuation, and the misspelling of the
      word “delighted,” the whole letter, and even the long, narrow
      envelope in which it was put filled my heart with tenderness. In the
      sprawling but diffident handwriting I recognised Sasha’s walk, her
      way of raising her eyebrows when she laughed, the movement of her lips. .
      . . But the contents of the letter did not satisfy me. In the first place,
      poetical letters are not answered in that way, and in the second, why
      should I go to Sasha’s house to wait till it should occur to her
      stout mamma, her brothers, and poor relations to leave us alone together?
      It would never enter their heads, and nothing is more hateful than to have
      to restrain one’s raptures simply because of the intrusion of some
      animate trumpery in the shape of a half-deaf old woman or little girl
      pestering one with questions. I sent an answer by the maid asking Sasha to
      select some park or boulevard for a rendezvous. My suggestion was readily
      accepted. I had struck the right chord, as the saying is.

 Between four and five o’clock in the afternoon I made my way to the
      furthest and most overgrown part of the park. There was not a soul in the
      park, and the tryst might have taken place somewhere nearer in one of the
      avenues or arbours, but women don’t like doing it by halves in
      romantic affairs; in for a penny, in for a pound—if you are in for a
      tryst, let it be in the furthest and most impenetrable thicket, where one
      runs the risk of stumbling upon some rough or drunken man. When I went up
      to Sasha she was standing with her back to me, and in that back I could
      read a devilish lot of mystery. It seemed as though that back and the nape
      of her neck, and the black spots on her dress were saying: Hush! . . . The
      girl was wearing a simple cotton dress over which she had thrown a light
      cape. To add to the air of mysterious secrecy, her face was covered with a
      white veil. Not to spoil the effect, I had to approach on tiptoe and speak
      in a half whisper.

 From what I remember now, I was not so much the essential point of the
      rendezvous as a detail of it. Sasha was not so much absorbed in the
      interview itself as in its romantic mysteriousness, my kisses, the silence
      of the gloomy trees, my vows. . . . There was not a minute in which she
      forgot herself, was overcome, or let the mysterious expression drop from
      her face, and really if there had been any Ivan Sidoritch or Sidor
      Ivanitch in my place she would have felt just as happy. How is one to make
      out in such circumstances whether one is loved or not? Whether the love is
      “the real thing” or not?

 From the park I took Sasha home with me. The presence of the beloved woman
      in one’s bachelor quarters affects one like wine and music. Usually
      one begins to speak of the future, and the confidence and self-reliance
      with which one does so is beyond bounds. You make plans and projects, talk
      fervently of the rank of general though you have not yet reached the rank
      of a lieutenant, and altogether you fire off such high-flown nonsense that
      your listener must have a great deal of love and ignorance of life to
      assent to it. Fortunately for men, women in love are always blinded by
      their feelings and never know anything of life. Far from not assenting,
      they actually turn pale with holy awe, are full of reverence and hang
      greedily on the maniac’s words. Sasha listened to me with attention,
      but I soon detected an absent-minded expression on her face, she did not
      understand me. The future of which I talked interested her only in its
      external aspect and I was wasting time in displaying my plans and projects
      before her. She was keenly interested in knowing which would be her room,
      what paper she would have in the room, why I had an upright piano instead
      of a grand piano, and so on. She examined carefully all the little things
      on my table, looked at the photographs, sniffed at the bottles, peeled the
      old stamps off the envelopes, saying she wanted them for something.

 “Please collect old stamps for me!” she said, making a grave
      face. “Please do.”

 Then she found a nut in the window, noisily cracked it and ate it.

 “Why don’t you stick little labels on the backs of your books?”
      she asked, taking a look at the bookcase.

 “What for?”

 “Oh, so that each book should have its number. And where am I to put
      my books? I’ve got books too, you know.”

 “What books have you got?” I asked.

 Sasha raised her eyebrows, thought a moment and said:

 “All sorts.”

 And if it had entered my head to ask her what thoughts, what convictions,
      what aims she had, she would no doubt have raised her eyebrows, thought a
      minute, and have said in the same way: “All sorts.”

 Later I saw Sasha home and left her house regularly, officially engaged,
      and was so reckoned till our wedding. If the reader will allow me to judge
      merely from my personal experience, I maintain that to be engaged is very
      dreary, far more so than to be a husband or nothing at all. An engaged man
      is neither one thing nor the other, he has left one side of the river and
      not reached the other, he is not married and yet he can’t be said to
      be a bachelor, but is in something not unlike the condition of the porter
      whom I have mentioned above.

 Every day as soon as I had a free moment I hastened to my fiancée. As I
      went I usually bore within me a multitude of hopes, desires, intentions,
      suggestions, phrases. I always fancied that as soon as the maid opened the
      door I should, from feeling oppressed and stifled, plunge at once up to my
      neck into a sea of refreshing happiness. But it always turned out
      otherwise in fact. Every time I went to see my fiancée I found all her
      family and other members of the household busy over the silly trousseau.
      (And by the way, they were hard at work sewing for two months and then
      they had less than a hundred roubles’ worth of things). There was a
      smell of irons, candle grease and fumes. Bugles scrunched under one’s
      feet. The two most important rooms were piled up with billows of linen,
      calico, and muslin and from among the billows peeped out Sasha’s
      little head with a thread between her teeth. All the sewing party welcomed
      me with cries of delight but at once led me off into the dining-room where
      I could not hinder them nor see what only husbands are permitted to
      behold. In spite of my feelings, I had to sit in the dining-room and
      converse with Pimenovna, one of the poor relations. Sasha, looking worried
      and excited, kept running by me with a thimble, a skein of wool or some
      other boring object.

 “Wait, wait, I shan’t be a minute,” she would say when I
      raised imploring eyes to her. “Only fancy that wretch Stepanida has
      spoilt the bodice of the barège dress!”

 And after waiting in vain for this grace, I lost my temper, went out of
      the house and walked about the streets in the company of the new cane I
      had bought. Or I would want to go for a walk or a drive with my fiancée,
      would go round and find her already standing in the hall with her mother,
      dressed to go out and playing with her parasol.

 “Oh, we are going to the Arcade,” she would say. “We
      have got to buy some more cashmere and change the hat.”

 My outing is knocked on the head. I join the ladies and go with them to
      the Arcade. It is revoltingly dull to listen to women shopping, haggling
      and trying to outdo the sharp shopman. I felt ashamed when Sasha, after
      turning over masses of material and knocking down the prices to a minimum,
      walked out of the shop without buying anything, or else told the shopman
      to cut her some half rouble’s worth.

 When they came out of the shop, Sasha and her mamma with scared and
      worried faces would discuss at length having made a mistake, having bought
      the wrong thing, the flowers in the chintz being too dark, and so on.

 Yes, it is a bore to be engaged! I’m glad it’s over.

 Now I am married. It is evening. I am sitting in my study reading. Behind
      me on the sofa Sasha is sitting munching something noisily. I want a glass
      of beer.

 “Sasha, look for the corkscrew. . . .” I say. “It’s
      lying about somewhere.”

 Sasha leaps up, rummages in a disorderly way among two or three heaps of
      papers, drops the matches, and without finding the corkscrew, sits down in
      silence. . . . Five minutes pass—ten. . . I begin to be fretted both
      by thirst and vexation.

 “Sasha, do look for the corkscrew,” I say.

 Sasha leaps up again and rummages among the papers near me. Her munching
      and rustling of the papers affects me like the sound of sharpening knives
      against each other. . . . I get up and begin looking for the corkscrew
      myself. At last it is found and the beer is uncorked. Sasha remains by the
      table and begins telling me something at great length.

 “You’d better read something, Sasha,” I say.

 She takes up a book, sits down facing me and begins moving her lips . . .
      . I look at her little forehead, moving lips, and sink into thought.

 “She is getting on for twenty. . . .” I reflect. “If one
      takes a boy of the educated class and of that age and compares them, what
      a difference! The boy would have knowledge and convictions and some
      intelligence.”

 But I forgive that difference just as the low forehead and moving lips are
      forgiven. I remember in my old Lovelace days I have cast off women for a
      stain on their stockings, or for one foolish word, or for not cleaning
      their teeth, and now I forgive everything: the munching, the muddling
      about after the corkscrew, the slovenliness, the long talking about
      nothing that matters; I forgive it all almost unconsciously, with no
      effort of will, as though Sasha’s mistakes were my mistakes, and
      many things which would have made me wince in old days move me to
      tenderness and even rapture. The explanation of this forgiveness of
      everything lies in my love for Sasha, but what is the explanation of the
      love itself, I really don’t know.
