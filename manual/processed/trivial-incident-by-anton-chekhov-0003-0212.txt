A TRIVIAL INCIDENT
    

      IT was a sunny August midday as, in company with a Russian prince who had
      come down in the world, I drove into the immense so-called Shabelsky
      pine-forest where we were intending to look for woodcocks. In virtue of
      the part he plays in this story my poor prince deserves a detailed
      description. He was a tall, dark man, still youngish, though already
      somewhat battered by life; with long moustaches like a police captain's;
      with prominent black eyes, and with the manners of a retired army man. He
      was a man of Oriental type, not very intelligent, but straightforward and
      honest, not a bully, not a fop, and not a rake-virtues which, in the eyes
      of the general public, are equivalent to a certificate of being a
      nonentity and a poor creature. People generally did not like him (he was
      never spoken of in the district, except as "the illustrious duffer"). I
      personally found the poor prince extremely nice with his misfortunes and
      failures, which made up indeed his whole life. First of all he was poor.
      He did not play cards, did not drink, had no occupation, did not poke his
      nose into anything, and maintained a perpetual silence but yet he had
      somehow succeeded in getting through thirty to forty thousand roubles left
      him at his father's death. God only knows what had become of the money.
      All that I can say is that owing to lack of supervision a great deal was
      stolen by stewards, bailiffs, and even footmen; a great deal went on
      lending money, giving bail, and standing security. There were few
      landowners in the district who did not owe him money. He gave to all who
      asked, and not so much from good nature or confidence in people as from
      exaggerated gentlemanliness as though he would say: "Take it and feel how
      comme il faut I am!" By the time I made his acquaintance he had got
      into debt himself, had learned what it was like to have a second mortgage
      on his land, and had sunk so deeply into difficulties that there was no
      chance of his ever getting out of them again. There were days when he had
      no dinner, and went about with an empty cigar-holder, but he was always
      seen clean and fashionably dressed, and always smelt strongly of
      ylang-ylang.
    

      The prince's second misfortune was his absolute solitariness. He was not
      married, he had no friends nor relations. His silent and reserved
      character and his comme il faut deportment, which became the more
      conspicuous the more anxious he was to conceal his poverty, prevented him
      from becoming intimate with people. For love affairs he was too heavy,
      spiritless, and cold, and so rarely got on with women. . . .
    

      When we reached the forest this prince and I got out of the chaise and
      walked along a narrow woodland path which was hidden among huge ferns. But
      before we had gone a hundred paces a tall, lank figure with a long oval
      face, wearing a shabby reefer jacket, a straw hat, and patent leather
      boots, rose up from behind a young fir-tree some three feet high, as
      though he had sprung out of the ground. The stranger held in one hand a
      basket of mushrooms, with the other he playfully fingered a cheap
      watch-chain on his waistcoat. On seeing us he was taken aback, smoothed
      his waistcoat, coughed politely, and gave an agreeable smile, as though he
      were delighted to see such nice people as us. Then, to our complete
      surprise, he came up to us, scraping with his long feet on the grass,
      bending his whole person, and, still smiling agreeably, lifted his hat and
      pronounced in a sugary voice with the intonations of a whining dog:
    

      "Aie, aie . . . gentlemen, painful as it is, it is my duty to warn you
      that shooting is forbidden in this wood. Pardon me for venturing to
      disturb you, though unacquainted, but . . . allow me to present myself. I
      am Grontovsky, the head clerk on Madame Kandurin's estate."
    

      "Pleased to make your acquaintance, but why can't we shoot?"
    

      "Such is the wish of the owner of this forest!"
    

      The prince and I exchanged glances. A moment passed in silence. The prince
      stood looking pensively at a big fly agaric at his feet, which he had
      crushed with his stick. Grontovsky went on smiling agreeably. His whole
      face was twitching, exuding honey, and even the watch-chain on his
      waistcoat seemed to be smiling and trying to impress us all with its
      refinement. A shade of embarrassment passed over us like an angel passing;
      all three of us felt awkward.
    

      "Nonsense!" I said. "Only last week I was shooting here!"
    

      "Very possible!" Grontovsky sniggered through his teeth. "As a matter of
      fact everyone shoots here regardless of the prohibition. But once I have
      met you, it is my duty . . . my sacred duty to warn you. I am a man in a
      dependent position. If the forest were mine, on the word of honour of a
      Grontovsky, I should not oppose your agreeable pleasure. But whose fault
      is it that I am in a dependent position?"
    

      The lanky individual sighed and shrugged his shoulders. I began arguing,
      getting hot and protesting, but the more loudly and impressively I spoke
      the more mawkish and sugary Grontovsky's face became. Evidently the
      consciousness of a certain power over us afforded him the greatest
      gratification. He was enjoying his condescending tone, his politeness, his
      manners, and with peculiar relish pronounced his sonorous surname, of
      which he was probably very fond. Standing before us he felt more than at
      ease, but judging from the confused sideway glances he cast from time to
      time at his basket, only one thing was spoiling his satisfaction-the
      mushrooms, womanish, peasantish, prose, derogatory to his dignity.
    

      "We can't go back!" I said. "We have come over ten miles!"
    

      "What's to be done?" sighed Grontovsky. "If you had come not ten but a
      hundred thousand miles, if the king even had come from America or from
      some other distant land, even then I should think it my duty . . . sacred,
      so to say, obligation . . ."
    

      "Does the forest belong to Nadyezhda Lvovna?" asked the prince.
    

      "Yes, Nadyezhda Lvovna . . ."
    

      "Is she at home now?"
    

      "Yes . . . I tell you what, you go to her, it is not more than half a mile
      from here; if she gives you a note, then I. . . . I needn't say! Ha-ha . .
      . he-he-!"
    

      "By all means," I agreed. "It's much nearer than to go back. . . . You go
      to her, Sergey Ivanitch," I said, addressing the prince. "You know her."
    

      The prince, who had been gazing the whole time at the crushed agaric,
      raised his eyes to me, thought a minute, and said:
    

      "I used to know her at one time, but . . . it's rather awkward for me to
      go to her. Besides, I am in shabby clothes. . . . You go, you don't know
      her. . . . It's more suitable for you to go."
    

      I agreed. We got into our chaise and, followed by Grontovsky's smiles,
      drove along the edge of the forest to the manor house. I was not
      acquainted with Nadyezhda Lvovna Kandurin, nÃ©e Shabelsky. I had never seen
      her at close quarters, and knew her only by hearsay. I knew that she was
      incredibly wealthy, richer than anyone else in the province. After the
      death of her father, Shabelsky, who was a landowner with no other
      children, she was left with several estates, a stud farm, and a lot of
      money. I had heard that, though she was only twenty-five or twenty-six,
      she was ugly, uninteresting, and as insignificant as anybody, and was only
      distinguished from the ordinary ladies of the district by her immense
      wealth.
    

      It has always seemed to me that wealth is felt, and that the rich must
      have special feelings unknown to the poor. Often as I passed by Nadyezhda
      Lvovna's big fruit garden, in which stood the large, heavy house with its
      windows always curtained, I thought: "What is she thinking at this moment?
      Is there happiness behind those blinds?" and so on. Once I saw her from a
      distance in a fine light cabriolet, driving a handsome white horse, and,
      sinful man that I am, I not only envied her, but even thought that in her
      poses, in her movements, there was something special, not to be found in
      people who are not rich, just as persons of a servile nature succeed in
      discovering "good family" at the first glance in people of the most
      ordinary exterior, if they are a little more distinguished than
      themselves. Nadyezhda Lvovna's inner life was only known to me by scandal.
      It was said in the district that five or six years ago, before she was
      married, during her father's lifetime, she had been passionately in love
      with Prince Sergey Ivanitch, who was now beside me in the chaise. The
      prince had been fond of visiting her father, and used to spend whole days
      in his billiard room, where he played pyramids indefatigably till his arms
      and legs ached. Six months before the old man's death he had suddenly
      given up visiting the Shabelskys. The gossip of the district having no
      positive facts to go upon explained this abrupt change in their relations
      in various ways. Some said that the prince, having observed the plain
      daughter's feeling for him and being unable to reciprocate it, considered
      it the duty of a gentleman to cut short his visits. Others maintained that
      old Shabelsky had discovered why his daughter was pining away, and had
      proposed to the poverty-stricken prince that he should marry her; the
      prince, imagining in his narrow-minded way that they were trying to buy
      him together with his title, was indignant, said foolish things, and
      quarrelled with them. What was true and what was false in this nonsense
      was difficult to say. But that there was a portion of truth in it was
      evident, from the fact that the prince always avoided conversation about
      Nadyezhda Lvovna.
    

      I knew that soon after her father's death Nadyezhda Lvovna had married one
      Kandurin, a bachelor of law, not wealthy, but adroit, who had come on a
      visit to the neighbourhood. She married him not from love, but because she
      was touched by the love of the legal gentleman who, so it was said, had
      cleverly played the love-sick swain. At the time I am describing, Kandurin
      was for some reason living in Cairo, and writing thence to his friend, the
      marshal of the district, "Notes of Travel," while she sat languishing
      behind lowered blinds, surrounded by idle parasites, and whiled away her
      dreary days in petty philanthropy.
    

      On the way to the house the prince fell to talking.
    

      "It's three days since I have been at home," he said in a half whisper,
      with a sidelong glance at the driver. "I am not a child, nor a silly
      woman, and I have no prejudices, but I can't stand the bailiffs. When I
      see a bailiff in my house I turn pale and tremble, and even have a
      twitching in the calves of my legs. Do you know Rogozhin refused to honour
      my note?"
    

      The prince did not, as a rule, like to complain of his straitened
      circumstances; where poverty was concerned he was reserved and exceedingly
      proud and sensitive, and so this announcement surprised me. He stared a
      long time at the yellow clearing, warmed by the sun, watched a long string
      of cranes float in the azure sky, and turned facing me.
    

      "And by the sixth of September I must have the money ready for the bank .
      . . the interest for my estate," he said aloud, by now regardless of the
      coachman. "And where am I to get it? Altogether, old man, I am in a tight
      fix! An awfully tight fix!"
    

      The prince examined the cock of his gun, blew on it for some reason, and
      began looking for the cranes which by now were out of sight.
    

      "Sergey Ivanitch," I asked, after a minute's silence, "imagine if they
      sell your Shatilovka, what will you do?"
    

      "I? I don't know! Shatilovka can't be saved, that's clear as daylight, but
      I cannot imagine such a calamity. I can't imagine myself without my daily
      bread secure. What can I do? I have had hardly any education; I have not
      tried working yet; for government service it is late to begin, . . .
      Besides, where could I serve? Where could I be of use? Admitting that no
      great cleverness is needed for serving in our Zemstvo, for example, yet I
      suffer from . . . the devil knows what, a sort of faintheartedness, I
      haven't a ha'p'orth of pluck. If I went into the Service I should always
      feel I was not in my right place. I am not an idealist; I am not a
      Utopian; I haven't any special principles; but am simply, I suppose,
      stupid and thoroughly incompetent, a neurotic and a coward. Altogether not
      like other people. All other people are like other people, only I seem to
      be something . . . a poor thing. . . . I met Naryagin last Wednesday-you
      know him?-drunken, slovenly . . . doesn't pay his debts, stupid" (the
      prince frowned and tossed his head) . . . "a horrible person! He said to
      me, staggering: 'I'm being balloted for as a justice of the peace!' Of
      course, they won't elect him, but, you see, he believes he is fit to be a
      justice of the peace and considers that position within his capacity. He
      has boldness and self-confidence. I went to see our investigating
      magistrate too. The man gets two hundred and fifty roubles a month, and
      does scarcely anything. All he can do is to stride backwards and forwards
      for days together in nothing but his underclothes, but, ask him, he is
      convinced he is doing his work and honourably performing his duty. I
      couldn't go on like that! I should be ashamed to look the clerk in the
      face."
    

      At that moment Grontovsky, on a chestnut horse, galloped by us with a
      flourish. On his left arm the basket bobbed up and down with the mushrooms
      dancing in it. As he passed us he grinned and waved his hand, as though we
      were old friends.
    

      "Blockhead!" the prince filtered through his teeth, looking after him.
      "It's wonderful how disgusting it sometimes is to see satisfied faces. A
      stupid, animal feeling due to hunger, I expect. . . . What was I saying?
      Oh, yes, about going into the Service, . . . I should be ashamed to take
      the salary, and yet, to tell the truth, it is stupid. If one looks at it
      from a broader point of view, more seriously, I am eating what isn't mine
      now. Am I not? But why am I not ashamed of that. . . . It is a case of
      habit, I suppose . . . and not being able to realize one's true position.
      . . . But that position is most likely awful. . ."
    

      I looked at him, wondering if the prince were showing off. But his face
      was mild and his eyes were mournfully following the movements of the
      chestnut horse racing away, as though his happiness were racing away with
      it.
    

      Apparently he was in that mood of irritation and sadness when women weep
      quietly for no reason, and men feel a craving to complain of themselves,
      of life, of God. . . .
    

      When I got out of the chaise at the gates of the house the prince said to
      me:
    

      "A man once said, wanting to annoy me, that I have the face of a
      cardsharper. I have noticed that cardsharpers are usually dark. Do you
      know, it seems that if I really had been born a cardsharper I should have
      remained a decent person to the day of my death, for I should never have
      had the boldness to do wrong. I tell you frankly I have had the chance
      once in my life of getting rich if I had told a lie, a lie to myself and
      one woman . . . and one other person whom I know would have forgiven me
      for lying; I should have put into my pocket a million. But I could not. I
      hadn't the pluck!"
    

      From the gates we had to go to the house through the copse by a long road,
      level as a ruler, and planted on each side with thick, lopped lilacs. The
      house looked somewhat heavy, tasteless, like a faÃ§ade on the stage. It
      rose clumsily out of a mass of greenery, and caught the eye like a great
      stone thrown on the velvety turf. At the chief entrance I was met by a fat
      old footman in a green swallow-tail coat and big silver-rimmed spectacles;
      without making any announcement, only looking contemptuously at my dusty
      figure, he showed me in. As I mounted the soft carpeted stairs there was,
      for some reason, a strong smell of india-rubber. At the top I was
      enveloped in an atmosphere found only in museums, in signorial mansions
      and old-fashioned merchant houses; it seemed like the smell of something
      long past, which had once lived and died and had left its soul in the
      rooms. I passed through three or four rooms on my way from the entry to
      the drawing-room. I remember bright yellow, shining floors, lustres
      wrapped in stiff muslin, narrow, striped rugs which stretched not straight
      from door to door, as they usually do, but along the walls, so that not
      venturing to touch the bright floor with my muddy boots I had to describe
      a rectangle in each room. In the drawing-room, where the footman left me,
      stood old-fashioned ancestral furniture in white covers, shrouded in
      twilight. It looked surly and elderly, and, as though out of respect for
      its repose, not a sound was audible.
    

      Even the clock was silent . . . it seemed as though the Princess Tarakanov
      had fallen asleep in the golden frame, and the water and the rats were
      still and motionless through magic. The daylight, afraid of disturbing the
      universal tranquillity, scarcely pierced through the lowered blinds, and
      lay on the soft rugs in pale, slumbering streaks.
    

      Three minutes passed and a big, elderly woman in black, with her cheek
      bandaged up, walked noiselessly into the drawing-room. She bowed to me and
      pulled up the blinds. At once, enveloped in the bright sunlight, the rats
      and water in the picture came to life and movement, Princess Tarakanov was
      awakened, and the old chairs frowned gloomily.
    

      "Her honour will be here in a minute, sir . . ." sighed the old lady,
      frowning too.
    

      A few more minutes of waiting and I saw Nadyezhda Lvovna. What struck me
      first of all was that she certainly was ugly, short, scraggy, and
      round-shouldered. Her thick, chestnut hair was magnificent; her face, pure
      and with a look of culture in it, was aglow with youth; there was a clear
      and intelligent expression in her eyes; but the whole charm of her head
      was lost through the thickness of her lips and the over-acute facial
      angle.
    

      I mentioned my name, and announced the object of my visit.
    

      "I really don't know what I am to say!" she said, in hesitation, dropping
      her eyes and smiling. "I don't like to refuse, and at the same time. . .
      ."
    

      "Do, please," I begged.
    

      Nadyezhda Lvovna looked at me and laughed. I laughed too. She was probably
      amused by what Grontovsky had so enjoyed-that is, the right of giving or
      withholding permission; my visit suddenly struck me as queer and strange.
    

      "I don't like to break the long-established rules," said Madame Kandurin.
      "Shooting has been forbidden on our estate for the last six years. No!"
      she shook her head resolutely. "Excuse me, I must refuse you. If I allow
      you I must allow others. I don't like unfairness. Either let all or no
      one."
    

      "I am sorry!" I sighed. "It's all the sadder because we have come more
      than ten miles. I am not alone," I added, "Prince Sergey Ivanitch is with
      me."
    

      I uttered the prince's name with no arriÃ¨re pensÃ©e, not prompted by
      any special motive or aim; I simply blurted it out without thinking, in
      the simplicity of my heart. Hearing the familiar name Madame Kandurin
      started, and bent a prolonged gaze upon me. I noticed her nose turn pale.
    

      "That makes no difference . . ." she said, dropping her eyes.
    

      As I talked to her I stood at the window that looked out on the shrubbery.
      I could see the whole shrubbery with the avenues and the ponds and the
      road by which I had come. At the end of the road, beyond the gates, the
      back of our chaise made a dark patch. Near the gate, with his back to the
      house, the prince was standing with his legs apart, talking to the lanky
      Grontovsky.
    

      Madame Kandurin had been standing all the time at the other window. She
      looked from time to time towards the shrubbery, and from the moment I
      mentioned the prince's name she did not turn away from the window.
    

      "Excuse me," she said, screwing up her eyes as she looked towards the road
      and the gate, "but it would be unfair to allow you only to shoot. . . .
      And, besides, what pleasure is there in shooting birds? What's it for? Are
      they in your way?"
    

      A solitary life, immured within four walls, with its indoor twilight and
      heavy smell of decaying furniture, disposes people to sentimentality.
      Madame Kandurin's idea did her credit, but I could not resist saying:
    

      "If one takes that line one ought to go barefoot. Boots are made out of
      the leather of slaughtered animals."
    

      "One must distinguish between a necessity and a caprice," Madame Kandurin
      answered in a toneless voice.
    

      She had by now recognized the prince, and did not take her eyes off his
      figure. It is hard to describe the delight and the suffering with which
      her ugly face was radiant! Her eyes were smiling and shining, her lips
      were quivering and laughing, while her face craned closer to the panes.
      Keeping hold of a flower-pot with both hands, with bated breath and with
      one foot slightly lifted, she reminded me of a dog pointing and waiting
      with passionate impatience for "Fetch it!"
    

      I looked at her and at the prince who could not tell a lie once in his
      life, and I felt angry and bitter against truth and falsehood, which play
      such an elemental part in the personal happiness of men.
    

      The prince started suddenly, took aim and fired. A hawk, flying over him,
      fluttered its wings and flew like an arrow far away.
    

      "He aimed too high!" I said. "And so, Nadyezhda Lvovna," I sighed, moving
      away from the window, "you will not permit . . ."-Madame Kandurin was
      silent.
    

      "I have the honour to take my leave," I said, "and I beg you to forgive my
      disturbing you. . ."
    

      Madame Kandurin would have turned facing me, and had already moved through
      a quarter of the angle, when she suddenly hid her face behind the
      hangings, as though she felt tears in her eyes that she wanted to conceal.
    

      "Good-bye. . . . Forgive me . . ." she said softly.
    

      I bowed to her back, and strode away across the bright yellow floors, no
      longer keeping to the carpet. I was glad to get away from this little
      domain of gilded boredom and sadness, and I hastened as though anxious to
      shake off a heavy, fantastic dream with its twilight, its enchanted
      princess, its lustres. . . .
    

      At the front door a maidservant overtook me and thrust a note into my
      hand: "Shooting is permitted on showing this. N. K.," I read.
