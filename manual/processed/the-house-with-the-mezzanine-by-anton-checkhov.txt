THE
      HOUSE WITH THE MEZZANINE
    

      (A PAINTER'S STORY)
    

IT happened nigh on seven years ago, when I was
      living in one of the districts of the J. province, on the estate of
      Bielokurov, a landowner, a young man who used to get up early, dress
      himself in a long overcoat, drink beer in the evenings, and all the while
      complain to me that he could nowhere find any one in sympathy with his
      ideas. He lived in a little house in the orchard, and I lived in the old
      manor-house, in a huge pillared hall where there was no furniture except a
      large divan, on which I slept, and a table at which I used to play
      patience. Even in calm weather there was always a moaning in the chimney,
      and in a storm the whole house would rock and seem as though it must
      split, and it was quite terrifying, especially at night, when all the ten
      great windows were suddenly lit up by a flash of lightning.
    

      Doomed by fate to permanent idleness, I did positively nothing. For hours
      together I would sit and look through the windows at the sky, the birds,
      the trees and read my letters over and over again, and then for hours
      together I would sleep. Sometimes I would go out and wander aimlessly
      until evening.
    

      Once on my way home I came unexpectedly on a strange farmhouse. The sun
      was already setting, and the lengthening shadows were thrown over the
      ripening corn. Two rows of closely planted tall fir-trees stood like two
      thick walls, forming a sombre, magnificent avenue. I climbed the fence and
      walked up the avenue, slipping on the fir needles which lay two inches
      thick on the ground. It was still, dark, and only here and there in the
      tops of the trees shimmered a bright gold light casting the colours of the
      rainbow on a spider's web. The smell of the firs was almost suffocating.
      Then I turned into an avenue of limes. And here too were desolation and
      decay; the dead leaves rustled mournfully beneath my feet, and there were
      lurking shadows among the trees. To the right, in an old orchard, a
      goldhammer sang a faint reluctant song, and he too must have been old. The
      lime-trees soon came to an end and I came to a white house with a terrace
      and a mezzanine, and suddenly a vista opened upon a farmyard with a pond
      and a bathing-shed, and a row of green willows, with a village beyond, and
      above it stood a tall, slender belfry, on which glowed a cross catching
      the light of the setting sun. For a moment I was possessed with a sense of
      enchantment, intimate, particular, as though I had seen the scene before
      in my childhood.
    

      By the white-stone gate surmounted with stone lions, which led from the
      yard into the field, stood two girls. One of them, the elder, thin, pale,
      very handsome, with masses of chestnut hair and a little stubborn mouth,
      looked rather prim and scarcely glanced at me; the other, who was quite
      young—seventeen or eighteen, no more, also thin and pale, with a big
      mouth and big eyes, looked at me in surprise, as I passed, said something
      in English and looked confused, and it seemed to me that I had always
      known their dear faces. And I returned home feeling as though I had awoke
      from a pleasant dream.
    

      Soon after that, one afternoon, when Bielokurov and I were walking near
      the house, suddenly there came into the yard a spring-carriage in which
      sat one of the two girls, the elder. She had come to ask for subscriptions
      to a fund for those who had suffered in a recent fire. Without looking at
      us, she told us very seriously how many houses had been burned down in
      Sianov, how many men, women, and children had been left without shelter,
      and what had been done by the committee of which she was a member. She
      gave us the list for us to write our names, put it away, and began to say
      good-bye.
    

      "You have completely forgotten us, Piotr Petrovich," she said to
      Bielokurov, as she gave him her hand. "Come and see us, and if Mr. N. (she
      said my name) would like to see how the admirers of his talent live and
      would care to come and see us, then mother and I would be very pleased."
    

      I bowed.
    

      When she had gone Piotr Petrovich began to tell me about her. The girl, he
      said, was of a good family and her name was Lydia Volchaninov, and the
      estate, on which she lived with her mother and sister, was called, like
      the village on the other side of the pond, Sholkovka. Her father had once
      occupied an eminent position in Moscow and died a privy councillor.
      Notwithstanding their large means, the Volchaninovs always lived in the
      village, summer and winter, and Lydia was a teacher in the Zemstvo School
      at Sholkovka and earned twenty-five roubles a month. She only spent what
      she earned on herself and was proud of her independence.
    

      "They are an interesting family," said Bielokurov. "We ought to go and see
      them. They will be very glad to see you."
    

      One afternoon, during a holiday, we remembered the Volchaninovs and went
      over to Sholkovka. They were all at home. The mother, Ekaterina Pavlovna,
      had obviously once been handsome, but now she was stouter than her age
      warranted, suffered from asthma, was melancholy and absent-minded as she
      tried to entertain me with talk about painting. When she heard from her
      daughter that I might perhaps come over to Sholkovka, she hurriedly called
      to mind a few of my landscapes which she had seen in exhibitions in
      Moscow, and now she asked what I had tried to express in them. Lydia, or
      as she was called at home, Lyda, talked more to Bielokurov than to me.
      Seriously and without a smile, she asked him why he did not work for the
      Zemstvo and why up till now he had never been to a Zemstvo meeting.
    

      "It is not right of you, Piotr Petrovich," she said reproachfully. "It is
      not right. It is a shame."
    

      "True, Lyda, true," said her mother. "It is not right."
    

      "All our district is in Balaguin's hands," Lyda went on, turning to me.
      "He is the chairman of the council and all the jobs in the district are
      given to his nephews and brothers-in-law, and he does exactly as he likes.
      We ought to fight him. The young people ought to form a strong party; but
      you see what our young men are like. It is a shame, Piotr Petrovich."
    

      The younger sister, Genya, was silent during the conversation about the
      Zemstvo. She did not take part in serious conversations, for by the family
      she was not considered grown-up, and they gave her her baby-name,
      Missyuss, because as a child she used to call her English governess that.
      All the time she examined me curiously and when I looked at the
      photograph-album she explained: "This is my uncle.... That is my
      godfather," and fingered the portraits, and at the same time touched me
      with her shoulder in a childlike way, and I could see her small,
      undeveloped bosom, her thin shoulders, her long, slim waist tightly drawn
      in by a belt.
    

      We played croquet and lawn-tennis, walked in the garden, had tea, and then
      a large supper. After the huge pillared hall, I felt out of tune in the
      small cosy house, where there were no oleographs on the walls and the
      servants were treated considerately, and everything seemed to me young and
      pure, through the presence of Lyda and Missyuss, and everything was decent
      and orderly. At supper Lyda again talked to Bielokurov about the Zemstvo,
      about Balaguin, about school libraries. She was a lively, sincere, serious
      girl, and it was interesting to listen to her, though she spoke at length
      and in a loud voice—perhaps because she was used to holding forth at
      school. On the other hand, Piotr Petrovich, who from his university days
      had retained the habit of reducing any conversation to a discussion, spoke
      tediously, slowly, and deliberately, with an obvious desire to be taken
      for a clever and progressive man. He gesticulated and upset the sauce with
      his sleeve and it made a large pool on the table-cloth, though nobody but
      myself seemed to notice it.
    

      When we returned home the night was dark and still.
    

      "I call it good breeding," said Bielokurov, with a sigh, "not so much not
      to upset the sauce on the table, as not to notice it when some one else
      has done it. Yes. An admirable intellectual family. I'm rather out of
      touch with nice people. Ah! terribly. And all through business, business,
      business!"
    

      He went on to say what hard work being a good farmer meant. And I thought:
      What a stupid, lazy lout! When we talked seriously he would drag it out
      with his awful drawl—er, er, er—and he works just as he talks—slowly,
      always behindhand, never up to time; and as for his being businesslike, I
      don't believe it, for he often keeps letters given him to post for weeks
      in his pocket.
    

      "The worst of it is," he murmured as he walked along by my side, "the
      worst of it is that you go working away and never get any sympathy from
      anybody."
    

      II
    

      I began to frequent the Volchaninovs' house. Usually I sat on the bottom
      step of the veranda. I was filled with dissatisfaction, vague discontent
      with my life, which had passed so quickly and uninterestingly, and I
      thought all the while how good it would be to tear out of my breast my
      heart which had grown so weary. There would be talk going on on the
      terrace, the rustling of dresses, the fluttering of the pages of a book. I
      soon got used to Lyda receiving the sick all day long, and distributing
      books, and I used often to go with her to the village, bareheaded, under
      an umbrella. And in the evening she would hold forth about the Zemstvo and
      schools. She was very handsome, subtle, correct, and her lips were thin
      and sensitive, and whenever a serious conversation started she would say
      to me drily:
    

      "This won't interest you."
    

      I was not sympathetic to her. She did not like me because I was a
      landscape-painter, and in my pictures did not paint the suffering of the
      masses, and I seemed to her indifferent to what she believed in. I
      remember once driving along the shore of the Baikal and I met a Bouryat
      girl, in shirt and trousers of Chinese cotton, on horseback: I asked her
      if she would sell me her pipe and, while we were talking, she looked with
      scorn at my European face and hat, and in a moment she got bored with
      talking to me, whooped and galloped away. And in exactly the same way Lyda
      despised me as a stranger. Outwardly she never showed her dislike of me,
      but I felt it, and, as I sat on the bottom step of the terrace, I had a
      certain irritation and said that treating the peasants without being a
      doctor meant deceiving them, and that it is easy to be a benefactor when
      one owns four thousand acres.
    

      Her sister, Missyuss, had no such cares and spent her time in complete
      idleness, like myself. As soon as she got up in the morning she would take
      a book and read it on the terrace, sitting far back in a lounge chair so
      that her feet hardly touched the ground, or she would hide herself with
      her book in the lime-walk, or she would go through the gate into the
      field. She would read all day long, eagerly poring over the book, and only
      through her looking fatigued, dizzy, and pale sometimes, was it possible
      to guess how much her reading exhausted her. When she saw me come she
      would blush a little and leave her book, and, looking into my face with
      her big eyes, she would tell me of things that had happened, how the
      chimney in the servants' room had caught fire, or how the labourer had
      caught a large fish in the pond. On week-days she usually wore a
      bright-coloured blouse and a dark-blue skirt. We used to go out together
      and pluck cherries for jam, in the boat, and when she jumped to reach a
      cherry, or pulled the oars, her thin, round arms would shine through her
      wide sleeves. Or I would make a sketch and she would stand and watch me
      breathlessly.
    

      One Sunday, at the end of June, I went over to the Volchaninovs in the
      morning about nine o'clock. I walked through the park, avoiding the house,
      looking for mushrooms, which were very plentiful that summer, and marking
      them so as to pick them later with Genya. A warm wind was blowing. I met
      Genya and her mother, both in bright Sunday dresses, going home from
      church, and Genya was holding her hat against the wind. They told me they
      were going to have tea on the terrace.
    

      As a man without a care in the world, seeking somehow to justify his
      constant idleness, I have always found such festive mornings in a country
      house universally attractive. When the green garden, still moist with dew,
      shines in the sun and seems happy, and when the terrace smells of
      mignonette and oleander, and the young people have just returned from
      church and drink tea in the garden, and when they are all so gaily dressed
      and so merry, and when you know that all these healthy, satisfied,
      beautiful people will do nothing all day long, then you long for all life
      to be like that. So I thought then as I walked through the garden, quite
      prepared to drift like that without occupation or purpose, all through the
      day, all through the summer.
    

      Genya carried a basket and she looked as though she knew that she would
      find me there. We gathered mushrooms and talked, and whenever she asked me
      a question she stood in front of me to see my face.
    

      "Yesterday," she said, "a miracle happened in our village. Pelagueya, the
      cripple, has been ill for a whole year, and no doctors or medicines were
      any good, but yesterday an old woman muttered over her and she got
      better."
    

      "That's nothing," I said. "One should not go to sick people and old women
      for miracles. Is not health a miracle? And life itself? A miracle is
      something incomprehensible."
    

      "And you are not afraid of the incomprehensible?"
    

      "No. I like to face things I do not understand and I do not submit to
      them. I am superior to them. Man must think himself higher than lions,
      tigers, stars, higher than anything in nature, even higher than that which
      seems incomprehensible and miraculous. Otherwise he is not a man, but a
      mouse which is afraid of everything."
    

      Genya thought that I, as an artist, knew a great deal and could guess what
      I did not know. She wanted me to lead her into the region of the eternal
      and the beautiful, into the highest world, with which, as she thought, I
      was perfectly familiar, and she talked to me of God, of eternal life, of
      the miraculous. And I, who did not admit that I and my imagination would
      perish for ever, would reply: "Yes. Men are immortal. Yes, eternal life
      awaits us." And she would listen and believe me and never asked for proof.
    

      As we approached the house she suddenly stopped and said:
    

      "Our Lyda is a remarkable person, isn't she? I love her dearly and would
      gladly sacrifice my life for her at any time. But tell me"—Genya
      touched my sleeve with her finger—"but tell me, why do you argue
      with her all the time? Why are you so irritated?"
    

      "Because she is not right."
    

      Genya shook her head and tears came to her eyes.
    

      "How incomprehensible!" she muttered.
    

      At that moment Lyda came out, and she stood by the balcony with a
      riding-whip in her hand, and looked very fine and pretty in the sunlight
      as she gave some orders to a farm-hand. Bustling about and talking loudly,
      she tended two or three of her patients, and then with a businesslike,
      preoccupied look she walked through the house, opening one cupboard after
      another, and at last went off to the attic; it took some time to find her
      for dinner and she did not come until we had finished the soup. Somehow I
      remember all these, little details and love to dwell on them, and I
      remember the whole of that day vividly, though nothing particular
      happened. After dinner Genya read, lying in her lounge chair, and I sat on
      the bottom step of the terrace. We were silent. The sky was overcast and a
      thin fine rain began to fall. It was hot, the wind had dropped, and it
      seemed the day would never end. Ekaterina Pavlovna came out on to the
      terrace with a fan, looking very sleepy.
    

      "O, mamma," said Genya, kissing her hand. "It is not good for you to sleep
      during the day."
    

      They adored each other. When one went into the garden, the other would
      stand on the terrace and look at the trees and call: "Hello!" "Genya!" or
      "Mamma, dear, where are you?" They always prayed together and shared the
      same faith, and they understood each other very well, even when they were
      silent. And they treated other people in exactly the same way. Ekaterina
      Pavlovna also soon got used to me and became attached to me, and when I
      did not turn up for a few days she would send to inquire if I was well.
      And she too used to look admiringly at my sketches, and with the same
      frank loquacity she would tell me things that happened, and she would
      confide her domestic secrets to me.
    

      She revered her elder daughter. Lyda never came to her for caresses, and
      only talked about serious things: she went her own way and to her mother
      and sister she was as sacred and enigmatic as the admiral, sitting in his
      cabin, to his sailors.
    

      "Our Lyda is a remarkable person," her mother would often say; "isn't
      she?"
    

      And, now, as the soft rain fell, we spoke of Lyda:
    

      "She is a remarkable woman," said her mother, and added in a low voice
      like a conspirator's as she looked round, "such as she have to be looked
      for with a lamp in broad daylight, though you know, I am beginning to be
      anxious. The school, pharmacies, books—all very well, but why go to
      such extremes? She is twenty-three and it is time for her to think
      seriously about herself. If she goes on with her books and her pharmacies
      she won't know how life has passed.... She ought to marry."
    

      Genya, pale with reading, and with her hair ruffled, looked up and said,
      as if to herself, as she glanced at her mother:
    

      "Mamma, dear, everything depends on the will of God."
    

      And once more she plunged into her book.
    

      Bielokurov came over in a poddiovka, wearing an embroidered shirt.
      We played croquet and lawn-tennis, and when it grew dark we had a long
      supper, and Lyda once more spoke of her schools and Balaguin, who had got
      the whole district into his own hands. As I left the Volchaninovs that
      night I carried away an impression of a long, long idle day, with a sad
      consciousness that everything ends, however long it may be. Genya took me
      to the gate, and perhaps, because she had spent the whole day with me from
      the beginning to end, I felt somehow lonely without her, and the whole
      kindly family was dear to me: and for the first time during the whole of
      that summer I had a desire to work.
    

      "Tell me why you lead such a monotonous life," I asked Bielokurov, as we
      went home. "My life is tedious, dull, monotonous, because I am a painter,
      a queer fish, and have been worried all my life with envy, discontent,
      disbelief in my work: I am always poor, I am a vagabond, but you are a
      wealthy, normal man, a landowner, a gentleman—why do you live so
      tamely and take so little from life? Why, for instance, haven't you fallen
      in love with Lyda or Genya?"
    

      "You forget that I love another woman," answered Bielokurov.
    

      He meant his mistress, Lyabor Ivanovna, who lived with him in the orchard
      house. I used to see the lady every day, very stout, podgy, pompous, like
      a fatted goose, walking in the garden in a Russian head-dress, always with
      a sunshade, and the servants used to call her to meals or tea. Three years
      ago she rented a part of his house for the summer, and stayed on to live
      with Bielokurov, apparently for ever. She was ten years older than he and
      managed him very strictly, so that he had to ask her permission to go out.
      She would often sob and make horrible noises like a man with a cold, and
      then I used to send and tell her that I'm if she did not stop I would go
      away. Then she would stop.
    

      When we reached home, Bielokurov sat down on the divan and frowned and
      brooded, and I began to pace up and down the hall, feeling a sweet
      stirring in me, exactly like the stirring of love. I wanted to talk about
      the Volchaninovs.
    

      "Lyda could only fall in love with a Zemstvo worker like herself, some one
      who is run off his legs with hospitals and schools," I said. "For the sake
      of a girl like that a man might not only become a Zemstvo worker, but
      might even become worn out, like the tale of the iron boots. And Missyuss?
      How charming Missyuss is!"
    

      Bielokurov began to talk at length and with his drawling er-er-ers of the
      disease of the century—pessimism. He spoke confidently and
      argumentatively. Hundreds of miles of deserted, monotonous, blackened
      steppe could not so forcibly depress the mind as a man like that, sitting
      and talking and showing no signs of going away.
    

      "The point is neither pessimism nor optimism," I said irritably, "but that
      ninety-nine out of a hundred have no sense."
    

      Bielokurov took this to mean himself, was offended, and went away.
    

      III
    

      "The Prince is on a visit to Malozyomov and sends you his regards," said
      Lyda to her mother, as she came in and took off her gloves. "He told me
      many interesting things. He promised to bring forward in the Zemstvo
      Council the question of a medical station at Malozyomov, but he says there
      is little hope." And turning to me, she said: "Forgive me, I keep
      forgetting that you are not interested."
    

      I felt irritated.
    

      "Why not?" I asked and shrugged my shoulders. "You don't care about my
      opinion, but I assure you, the question greatly interests me."
    

      "Yes?"
    

      "In my opinion there is absolutely no need for a medical station at
      Malozyomov."
    

      My irritation affected her: she gave a glance at me, half closed her eyes
      and said:
    

      "What is wanted then? Landscapes?"
    

      "Not landscapes either. Nothing is wanted there."
    

      She finished taking off her gloves and took up a newspaper which had just
      come by post; a moment later, she said quietly, apparently controlling
      herself:
    

      "Last week Anna died in childbirth, and if a medical man had been
      available she would have lived. However, I suppose landscape-painters are
      entitled to their opinions."
    

      "I have a very definite opinion, I assure you," said I, and she took
      refuge behind the newspaper, as though she did not wish to listen. "In my
      opinion medical stations, schools, libraries, pharmacies, under existing
      conditions, only lead to slavery. The masses are caught in a vast chain:
      you do not cut it but only add new links to it. That is my opinion."
    

      She looked at me and smiled mockingly, and I went on, striving to catch
      the thread of my ideas.
    

      "It does not matter that Anna should die in childbirth, but it does matter
      that all these Annas, Mavras, Pelagueyas, from dawn to sunset should be
      grinding away, ill from overwork, all their lives worried about their
      starving sickly children; all their lives they are afraid of death and
      disease, and have to be looking after themselves; they fade in youth, grow
      old very early, and die in filth and dirt; their children as they grow up
      go the same way and hundreds of years slip by and millions of people live
      worse than animals—in constant dread of never having a crust to eat;
      but the horror of their position is that they have no time to think of
      their souls, no time to remember that they are made in the likeness of
      God; hunger, cold, animal fear, incessant work, like drifts of snow block
      all the ways to spiritual activity, to the very thing that distinguishes
      man from the animals, and is the only thing indeed that makes life worth
      living. You come to their assistance with hospitals and schools, but you
      do not free them from their fetters; on the contrary, you enslave them
      even more, since by introducing new prejudices into their lives, you
      increase the number of their demands, not to mention the fact that they
      have to pay the Zemstvo for their drugs and pamphlets, and therefore, have
      to work harder than ever."
    

      "I will not argue with you," said Lyda. "I have heard all that." She put
      down her paper. "I will only tell you one thing, it is no good sitting
      with folded hands. It is true, we do not save mankind, and perhaps we do
      make mistakes, but we do what we can and we are right. The highest and
      most sacred truth for an educated being—is to help his neighbours,
      and we do what we can to help. You do not like it, but it is impossible to
      please everybody."
    

      "True, Lyda, true," said her mother.
    

      In Lyda's presence her courage always failed her, and as she talked she
      would look timidly at her, for she was afraid of saying something foolish
      or out of place: and she never contradicted, but would always agree:
      "True, Lyda, true."
    

      "Teaching peasants to read and write, giving them little moral pamphlets
      and medical assistance, cannot decrease either ignorance or mortality,
      just as the light from your windows cannot illuminate this huge garden," I
      said. "You give nothing by your interference in the lives of these people.
      You only create new demands, and a new compulsion to work."
    

      "Ah! My God, but we must do something!" said Lyda exasperatedly, and I
      could tell by her voice that she thought my opinions negligible and
      despised me.
    

      "It is necessary," I said, "to free people from hard physical work. It is
      necessary to relieve them of their yoke, to give them breathing space, to
      save them from spending their whole lives in the kitchen or the byre, in
      the fields; they should have time to take thought of their souls, of God
      and to develop their spiritual capacities. Every human being's salvation
      lies in spiritual activity—in his continual search for truth and the
      meaning of life. Give them some relief from rough, animal labour, let them
      feel free, then you will see how ridiculous at bottom your pamphlets and
      pharmacies are. Once a human being is aware of his vocation, then he can
      only be satisfied with religion, service, art, and not with trifles like
      that."
    

      "Free them from work?" Lyda gave a smile. "Is that possible?"
    

      "Yes.... Take upon yourself a part of their work. If we all, in town and
      country, without exception, agreed to share the work which is being spent
      by mankind in the satisfaction of physical demands, then none of us would
      have to work more than two or three hours a day. If all of us, rich and
      poor, worked three hours a day the rest of our time would be free. And
      then to be still less dependent on our bodies, we should invent machines
      to do the work and we should try to reduce our demands to the minimum. We
      should toughen ourselves and our children should not be afraid of hunger
      and cold, and we should not be anxious about their health, as Anna, Maria,
      Pelagueya were anxious. Then supposing we did not bother about doctors and
      pharmacies, and did away with tobacco factories and distilleries—what
      a lot of free time we should have! We should give our leisure to service
      and the arts. Just as peasants all work together to repair the roads, so
      the whole community would work together to seek truth and the meaning of
      life, and, I am sure of it—truth would be found very soon, man would
      get rid of his continual, poignant, depressing fear of death and even of
      death itself."
    

      "But you contradict yourself," said Lyda. "You talk about service and deny
      education."
    

      "I deny the education of a man who can only use it to read the signs on
      the public houses and possibly a pamphlet which he is incapable of
      understanding—the kind of education we have had from the time of
      Riurik: and village life has remained exactly as it was then. Not
      education is wanted but freedom for the full development of spiritual
      capacities. Not schools are wanted but universities."
    

      "You deny medicine too."
    

      "Yes. It should only be used for the investigation of diseases, as natural
      phenomenon, not for their cure. It is no good curing diseases if you don't
      cure their causes. Remove the chief cause—physical labour, and there
      will be no diseases. I don't acknowledge the science which cures," I went
      on excitedly. "Science and art, when they are true, are directed not to
      temporary or private purposes, but to the eternal and the general—they
      seek the truth and the meaning of life, they seek God, the soul, and when
      they are harnessed to passing needs and activities, like pharmacies and
      libraries, then they only complicate and encumber life. We have any number
      of doctors, pharmacists, lawyers, and highly educated people, but we have
      no biologists, mathematicians, philosophers, poets. All our intellectual
      and spiritual energy is wasted on temporary passing needs.... Scientists,
      writers, painters work and work, and thanks to them the comforts of life
      grow greater every day, the demands of the body multiply, but we are still
      a long way from the truth and man still remains the most rapacious and
      unseemly of animals, and everything tends to make the majority of mankind
      degenerate and more and more lacking in vitality. Under such conditions
      the life of an artist has no meaning and the more talented he is, the more
      strange and incomprehensible his position is, since it only amounts to his
      working for the amusement of the predatory, disgusting animal, man, and
      supporting the existing state of things. And I don't want to work and will
      not.... Nothing is wanted, so let the world go to hell."
    

      "Missyuss, go away," said Lyda to her sister, evidently thinking my words
      dangerous to so young a girl.
    

      Genya looked sadly at her sister and mother and went out.
    

      "People generally talk like that," said Lyda, "when they want to excuse
      their indifference. It is easier to deny hospitals and schools than to
      come and teach."
    

      "True, Lyda, true," her mother agreed.
    

      "You say you will not work," Lyda went on. "Apparently you set a high
      price on your work, but do stop arguing. We shall never agree, since I
      value the most imperfect library or pharmacy, of which you spoke so
      scornfully just now, more than all the landscapes in the world." And at
      once she turned to her mother and began to talk in quite a different tone:
      "The Prince has got very thin, and is much changed since the last time he
      was here. The doctors are sending him to Vichy."
    

      She talked to her mother about the Prince to avoid talking to me. Her face
      was burning, and, in order to conceal her agitation, she bent over the
      table as if she were short-sighted and made a show of reading the
      newspaper. My presence was distasteful to her. I took my leave and went
      home.
    

      IV
    

      All was quiet outside: the village on the other side of the pond was
      already asleep, not a single light was to be seen, and on the pond there
      was only the faint reflection of the stars. By the gate with the stone
      lions stood Genya, waiting to accompany me.
    

      "The village is asleep," I said, trying to see her face in the darkness,
      and I could see her dark sad eyes fixed on me. "The innkeeper and the
      horse-stealers are sleeping quietly, and decent people like ourselves
      quarrel and irritate each other."
    

      It was a melancholy August night—melancholy because it already
      smelled of the autumn: the moon rose behind a purple cloud and hardly
      lighted the road and the dark fields of winter corn on either side. Stars
      fell frequently, Genya walked beside me on the road and tried not to look
      at the sky, to avoid seeing the falling stars, which somehow frightened
      her.
    

      "I believe you are right," she said, trembling in the evening chill. "If
      people could give themselves to spiritual activity, they would soon burst
      everything."
    

      "Certainly. We are superior beings, and if we really knew all the power of
      the human genius and lived only for higher purposes then we should become
      like gods. But this will never be. Mankind will degenerate and of their
      genius not a trace will be left."
    

      When the gate was out of sight Genya stopped and hurriedly shook my hand.
    

      "Good night," she said, trembling; her shoulders were covered only with a
      thin blouse and she was shivering with cold. "Come to-morrow."
    

      I was filled with a sudden dread of being left alone with my inevitable
      dissatisfaction with myself and people, and I, too, tried not to see the
      falling stars.
    

      "Stay with me a little longer," I said. "Please."
    

      I loved Genya, and she must have loved me, because she used to meet me and
      walk with me, and because she looked at me with tender admiration. How
      thrillingly beautiful her pale face was, her thin nose, her arms, her
      slenderness, her idleness, her constant reading. And her mind? I suspected
      her of having an unusual intellect: I was fascinated by the breadth of her
      views, perhaps because she thought differently from the strong, handsome
      Lyda, who did not love me. Genya liked me as a painter, I had conquered
      her heart by my talent, and I longed passionately to paint only for her,
      and I dreamed of her as my little queen, who would one day possess with me
      the trees, the fields, the river, the dawn, all Nature, wonderful and
      fascinating, with whom, as with them, I have felt helpless and useless.
    

      "Stay with me a moment longer," I called. "I implore you."
    

      I took off my overcoat and covered her childish shoulders. Fearing that
      she would look queer and ugly in a man's coat, she began to laugh and
      threw it off, and as she did so, I embraced her and began to cover her
      face, her shoulders, her arms with kisses.
    

      "Till to-morrow," she whispered timidly as though she was afraid to break
      the stillness of the night. She embraced me: "We have no secrets from one
      another. I must tell mamma and my sister.... Is it so terrible? Mamma will
      be pleased. Mamma loves you, but Lyda!"
    

      She ran to the gates.
    

      "Good-bye," she called out.
    

      For a couple of minutes I stood and heard her running. I had no desire to
      go home, there was nothing there to go for. I stood for a while lost in
      thought, and then quietly dragged myself back, to have one more look at
      the house in which she lived, the dear, simple, old house, which seemed to
      look at me with the windows of the mezzanine for eyes, and to understand
      everything. I walked past the terrace, sat down on a bench by the
      lawn-tennis court, in the darkness under an old elm-tree, and looked at
      the house. In the windows of the mezzanine, where Missyuss had her room,
      shone a bright light, and then a faint green glow. The lamp had been
      covered with a shade. Shadows began to move.... I was filled with
      tenderness and a calm satisfaction, to think that I could let myself be
      carried away and fall in love, and at the same time I felt uneasy at the
      thought that only a few yards away in one of the rooms of the house lay
      Lyda who did not love me, and perhaps hated me. I sat and waited to see if
      Genya would come out. I listened attentively and it seemed to me they were
      sitting in the mezzanine.
    

      An hour passed. The green light went out, and the shadows were no longer
      visible. The moon hung high above the house and lit the sleeping garden
      and the avenues: I could distinctly see the dahlias and roses in the
      flower-bed in front of the house, and all seemed to be of one colour. It
      was very cold. I left the garden, picked up my overcoat in the road, and
      walked slowly home.
    

      Next day after dinner when I went to the Volchaninovs', the glass door was
      wide open. I sat down on the terrace expecting Genya to come from behind
      the flower-bed or from one of the avenues, or to hear her voice come from
      out of the rooms; then I went into the drawing-room and the dining-room.
      There was not a soul to be seen. From the dining-room I went down a long
      passage into the hall, and then back again. There were several doors in
      the passage and behind one of them I could hear Lyda's voice:
    

      "To the crow somewhere ... God ..."—she spoke slowly and distinctly,
      and was probably dictating—" ... God sent a piece of cheese.... To
      the crow ... somewhere.... Who is there?" she called out suddenly as she
      heard my footsteps.
    

      "It is I."
    

      "Oh! excuse me. I can't come out just now. I am teaching Masha."
    

      "Is Ekaterina Pavlovna in the garden?"
    

      "No. She and my sister left to-day for my Aunt's in Penga, and in the
      winter they are probably going abroad." She added after a short silence:
      "To the crow somewhere God sent a pi-ece of cheese. Have you got that?"
    

      I went out into the hall, and, without a thought in my head, stood and
      looked out at the pond and the village, and still I heard:
    

      "A piece of cheese.... To the crow somewhere God sent a piece of cheese."
    

      And I left the house by the way I had come the first time, only reversing
      the order, from the yard into the garden, past the house, then along the
      lime-walk. Here a boy overtook me and handed me a note: "I have told my
      sister everything and she insists on my parting from you," I read. "I
      could not hurt her by disobeying. God will give you happiness. If you knew
      how bitterly mamma and I have cried."
    

      Then through the fir avenue and the rotten fence....Over the fields where
      the corn was ripening and the quails screamed, cows and shackled horses
      now were browsing. Here and there on the hills the winter corn was already
      showing green. A sober, workaday mood possessed me and I was ashamed of
      all I had said at the Volchaninovs', and once more it became tedious to go
      on living. I went home, packed my things, and left that evening for
      Petersburg.
    

      I never saw the Volchaninovs again. Lately on my way to the Crimea I met
      Bielokurov at a station. As of old he was in a poddiovka, wearing
      an embroidered shirt, and when I asked after his health, he replied:
      "Quite well, thanks be to God." He began to talk. He had sold his estate
      and bought another, smaller one in the name of Lyabov Ivanovna. He told me
      a little about the Volchaninovs. Lyda, he said, still lived at Sholkovka
      and taught the children in the school; little by little she succeeded in
      gathering round herself a circle of sympathetic people, who formed a
      strong party, and at the last Zemstvo election they drove out Balaguin,
      who up till then had had the whole district in his hands. Of Genya
      Bielokurov said that she did not live at home and he did not know where
      she was.
    

      I have already begun to forget about the house with the mezzanine, and
      only now and then, when I am working or reading, suddenly—without
      rhyme or reason—I remember the green light in the window, and the
      sound of my own footsteps as I walked through the fields that night, when
      I was in love, rubbing my hands to keep them warm. And even more rarely,
      when I am sad and lonely, I begin already to recollect and it seems to me
      that I, too, am being remembered and waited for, and that we shall
      meet....
    

      Missyuss, where are you?
    

TYPHUS
    

IN a smoking-compartment of the mail-train from
      Petrograd to Moscow sat a young lieutenant, Klimov by name. Opposite him
      sat an elderly man with a clean-shaven, shipmaster's face, to all
      appearances a well-to-do Finn or Swede, who all through the journey smoked
      a pipe and talked round and round the same subject.
    

      "Ha! you are an officer! My brother is also an officer, but he is a
      sailor. He is a sailor and is stationed at Kronstadt. Why are you going to
      Moscow?"
    

      "I am stationed there."
    

      "Ha! Are you married?"
    

      "No. I live with my aunt and sister."
    

      "My brother is also an officer, but he is married and has a wife and three
      children. Ha!"
    

      The Finn looked surprised at something, smiled broadly and fatuously as he
      exclaimed, "Ha," and every now and then blew through the stem of his pipe.
      Klimov, who was feeling rather unwell, and not at all inclined to answer
      questions, hated him with all his heart. He thought how good it would be
      to snatch his gurgling pipe out of his hands and throw it under the seat
      and to order the Finn himself into another car.
    

      "They are awful people, these Finns and ... Greeks," he thought. "Useless,
      good-for-nothing, disgusting people. They only cumber the earth. What is
      the good of them?"
    

      And the thought of Finns and Greeks filled him with a kind of nausea. He
      tried to compare them with the French and the Italians, but the idea of
      those races somehow roused in him the notion of organ-grinders, naked
      women, and the foreign oleographs which hung over the chest of drawers in
      his aunt's house.
    

      The young officer felt generally out of sorts. There seemed to be no room
      for his arms and legs, though he had the whole seat to himself; his mouth
      was dry and sticky, his head was heavy and his clouded thoughts seemed to
      wander at random, not only in his head, but also outside it among the
      seats and the people looming in the darkness. Through the turmoil in his
      brain, as through a dream, he heard the murmur of voices, the rattle of
      the wheels, the slamming of doors. Bells, whistles, conductors, the tramp
      of the people on the platforms came oftener than usual. The time slipped
      by quickly, imperceptibly, and it seemed that the train stopped every
      minute at a station as now and then there would come up the sound of
      metallic voices:
    

      "Is the post ready?"
    

      "Ready."
    

      It seemed to him that the stove-neater came in too often to look at the
      thermometer, and that trains never stopped passing and his own train was
      always roaring over bridges. The noise, the whistle, the Finn, the tobacco
      smoke—all mixed with the ominous shifting of misty shapes, weighed
      on Klimov like an intolerable nightmare. In terrible anguish he lifted up
      his aching head, looked at the lamp whose light was encircled with shadows
      and misty spots; he wanted to ask for water, but his dry tongue would
      hardly move, and he had hardly strength enough to answer the Finn's
      questions. He tried to lie down more comfortably and sleep, but he could
      not succeed; the Finn fell asleep several times, woke up and lighted his
      pipe, talked to him with his "Ha!" and went to sleep again; and the
      lieutenant could still not find room for his legs on the seat, and all the
      while the ominous figures shifted before his eyes.
    

      At Spirov he got out to have a drink of water. He saw some people sitting
      at a table eating hurriedly.
    

      "How can they eat?" he thought, trying to avoid the smell of roast meat in
      the air and seeing the chewing mouths, for both seemed to him utterly
      disgusting and made him feel sick.
    

      A handsome lady was talking to a military man in a red cap, and she showed
      magnificent white teeth when she smiled; her smile, her teeth, the lady
      herself produced in Klimov the same impression of disgust as the ham and
      the fried cutlets. He could not understand how the military man in the red
      cap could bear to sit near her and look at her healthy smiling face.
    

      After he had drunk some water, he went back to his place. The Finn sat and
      smoked. His pipe gurgled and sucked like a galoche full of holes in dirty
      weather.
    

      "Ha!" he said with some surprise. "What station is this?"
    

      "I don't know," said Klimov, lying down and shutting his mouth to keep out
      the acrid tobacco smoke.
    

      "When do we get to Tver."
    

      "I don't know. I am sorry, I ... I can't talk. I am not well. I have a
      cold."
    

      The Finn knocked out his pipe against the window-frame and began to talk
      of his brother, the sailor. Klimov paid no more attention to him and
      thought in agony of his soft, comfortable bed, of the bottle of cold
      water, of his sister Katy, who knew so well how to tuck him up and cosset
      him. He even smiled when there flashed across his mind his soldier-servant
      Pavel, taking off his heavy, close-fitting boots and putting water on the
      table. It seemed to him that he would only have to lie on his bed and
      drink some water and his nightmare would give way to a sound, healthy
      sleep.
    

      "Is the post ready?" came a dull voice from a distance.
    

      "Ready," answered a loud, bass voice almost by the very window.
    

      It was the second or third station from Spirov.
    

      Time passed quickly, seemed to gallop along, and there would be no end to
      the bells, whistles, and stops. In despair Klimov pressed his face into
      the corner of the cushion, held his head in his hands, and again began to
      think of his sister Katy and his orderly Pavel; but his sister and his
      orderly got mixed up with the looming figures and whirled about and
      disappeared. His breath, thrown back from the cushion, burned his face,
      and his legs ached and a draught from the window poured into his back,
      but, painful though it was, he refused to change his position.... A heavy,
      drugging torpor crept over him and chained his limbs.
    

      When at length he raised his head, the car was quite light. The passengers
      were putting on their overcoats and moving about. The train stopped.
      Porters in white aprons and number-plates bustled about the passengers and
      seized their boxes. Klimov put on his greatcoat mechanically and left the
      train, and he felt as though it were not himself walking, but some one
      else, a stranger, and he felt that he was accompanied by the heat of the
      train, his thirst, and the ominous, lowering figures which all night long
      had prevented his sleeping. Mechanically he got his luggage and took a
      cab. The cabman charged him one rouble and twenty-five copecks for driving
      him to Povarska Street, but he did not haggle and submissively took his
      seat in the sledge. He could still grasp the difference in numbers, but
      money had no value to him whatever.
    

      At home Klimov was met by his aunt and his sister Katy, a girl of
      eighteen. Katy had a copy-book and a pencil in her hands as she greeted
      him, and he remembered that she was preparing for a teacher's examination.
      He took no notice of their greetings and questions, but gasped from the
      heat, and walked aimlessly through the rooms until he reached his own, and
      then he fell prone on the bed. The Finn, the red cap, the lady with the
      white teeth, the smell of roast meat, the shifting spot in the lamp,
      filled his mind and he lost consciousness and did not hear the frightened
      voices near him.
    

      When he came to himself he found himself in bed, undressed, and noticed
      the water-bottle and Pavel, but it did not make him any more comfortable
      nor easy. His legs and arms, as before, felt cramped, his tongue clove to
      his palate, and he could hear the chuckle of the Finn's pipe.... By the
      bed, growing out of Pavel's broad back, a stout, black-bearded doctor was
      bustling.
    

      "All right, all right, my lad," he murmured. "Excellent, excellent....
      Jist so, jist so...."
    

      The doctor called Klimov "my lad." Instead of "just so," he said "jist
      saow," and instead of "yes," "yies."
    

      "Yies, yies, yies," he said. "Jist saow, jist saow.... Don't be
      downhearted!"
    

      The doctor's quick, careless way of speaking, his well-fed face, and the
      condescending tone in which he said "my lad" exasperated Klimov.
    

      "Why do you call me 'my lad'?" he moaned. "Why this familiarity, damn it
      all?"
    

      And he was frightened by the sound of his own voice. It was so dry, weak,
      and hollow that he could hardly recognise it.
    

      "Excellent, excellent," murmured the doctor, not at all offended. "Yies,
      yies. You mustn't be cross."
    

      And at home the time galloped away as alarmingly quickly as in the
      train.... The light of day in his bedroom was every now and then changed
      to the dim light of evening.... The doctor never seemed to leave the
      bedside, and his "Yies, yies, yies," could be heard at every moment.
      Through the room stretched an endless row of faces; Pavel, the Finn,
      Captain Taroshevich, Sergeant Maximenko, the red cap, the lady with the
      white teeth, the doctor. All of them talked, waved their hands, smoked,
      ate. Once in broad daylight Klimov saw his regimental priest, Father
      Alexander, in his stole and with the host in his hands, standing by the
      bedside and muttering something with such a serious expression as Klimov
      had never seen him wear before. The lieutenant remembered that Father
      Alexander used to call all the Catholic officers Poles, and wishing to
      make the priest laugh, he exclaimed:
    

      "Father Taroshevich, the Poles have fled to the woods."
    

      But Father Alexander, usually a gay, light-hearted man, did not laugh and
      looked even more serious, and made the sign of the cross over Klimov. At
      night, one after the other, there would come slowly creeping in and out
      two shadows. They were his aunt and his sister. The shadow of his sister
      would kneel down and pray; she would bow to the ikon, and her grey shadow
      on the wall would bow, too, so that two shadows prayed to God. And all the
      time there was a smell of roast meat and of the Finn's pipe, but once
      Klimov could detect a distinct smell of incense. He nearly vomited and
      cried:
    

      "Incense! Take it away."
    

      There was no reply. He could only hear priests chanting in an undertone
      and some one running on the stairs.
    

      When Klimov recovered from his delirium there was not a soul in the
      bedroom. The morning sun flared through the window and the drawn curtains,
      and a trembling beam, thin and keen as a sword, played on the
      water-bottle. He could hear the rattle of wheels—that meant there
      was no more snow in the streets. The lieutenant looked at the sunbeam, at
      the familiar furniture and the door, and his first inclination was to
      laugh. His chest and stomach trembled with a sweet, happy, tickling
      laughter. From head to foot his whole body was filled with a feeling of
      infinite happiness, like that which the first man must have felt when he
      stood erect and beheld the world for the first time. Klimov had a
      passionate longing for people, movement, talk. His body lay motionless; he
      could only move his hands, but he hardly noticed it, for his whole
      attention was fixed on little things. He was delighted with his breathing
      and with his laughter; he was delighted with the existence of the
      water-bottle, the ceiling, the sunbeam, the ribbon on the curtain. God's
      world, even in such a narrow corner as his bedroom, seemed to him
      beautiful, varied, great. When the doctor appeared the lieutenant thought
      how nice his medicine was, how nice and sympathetic the doctor was, how
      nice and interesting people were, on the whole.
    

      "Yies, yies, yies," said the doctor. "Excellent, excellent. Now we are
      well again. Jist saow. Jist saow."
    

      The lieutenant listened and laughed gleefully. He remembered the Finn, the
      lady with the white teeth, the train, and he wanted to eat and smoke.
    

      "Doctor," he said, "tell them to bring me a slice of rye bread and salt,
      and some sardines...."
    

      The doctor refused. Pavel did not obey his order and refused to go for
      bread. The lieutenant could not bear it and began to cry like a thwarted
      child.
    

      "Ba-by," the doctor laughed. "Mamma! Hush-aby!"
    

      Klimov also began to laugh, and when the doctor had gone, he fell sound
      asleep. He woke up with the same feeling of joy and happiness. His aunt
      was sitting by his bed.
    

      "Oh, aunty!" He was very happy. "What has been the matter with me?"
    

      "Typhus."
    

      "I say! And now I am well, quite well! Where is Katy?"
    

      "She is not at home. She has probably gone to see some one after her
      examination."
    

      The old woman bent over her stocking as she said this; her lips began to
      tremble; she turned her face away and suddenly began to sob. In her grief,
      she forgot the doctor's orders and cried:
    

      "Oh! Katy! Katy! Our angel is gone from us! She is gone!"
    

      She dropped her stocking and stooped down for it, and her cap fell off her
      head. Klimov stared at her grey hair, could not understand, was alarmed
      for Katy, and asked:
    

      "But where is she, aunty?"
    

      The old woman, who had already forgotten Klimov and remembered only her
      grief, said:
    

      "She caught typhus from you and ... and died. She was buried the day
      before yesterday."
    

      This sudden appalling piece of news came home to Klimov's mind, but
      dreadful and shocking though it was it could not subdue the animal joy
      which thrilled through the convalescent lieutenant. He cried, laughed, and
      soon began to complain that he was given nothing to eat.
    

      Only a week later, when, supported by Pavel, he walked in a dressing-gown
      to the window, and saw the grey spring sky and heard the horrible rattle
      of some old rails being carried by on a lorry, then his heart ached with
      sorrow and he began to weep and pressed his forehead against the
      window-frame.
    

      "How unhappy I am!" he murmured. "My God, how unhappy I am!"
    

      And joy gave way to his habitual weariness and a sense of his irreparable
      loss.
    

GOOSEBERRIES
    

FROM early morning the sky had been overcast with
      clouds; the day was still, cool, and wearisome, as usual on grey, dull
      days when the clouds hang low over the fields and it looks like rain,
      which never comes. Ivan Ivanich, the veterinary surgeon, and Bourkin, the
      schoolmaster, were tired of walking and the fields seemed endless to them.
      Far ahead they could just see the windmills of the village of Mirousky, to
      the right stretched away to disappear behind the village a line of hills,
      and they knew that it was the bank of the river; meadows, green willows,
      farmhouses; and from one of the hills there could be seen a field as
      endless, telegraph-posts, and the train, looking from a distance like a
      crawling caterpillar, and in clear weather even the town. In the calm
      weather when all Nature seemed gentle and melancholy, Ivan Ivanich and
      Bourkin were filled with love for the fields and thought how grand and
      beautiful the country was.
    

      "Last time, when we stopped in Prokofyi's shed," said Bourkin, "you were
      going to tell me a story."
    

      "Yes. I wanted to tell you about my brother."
    

      Ivan Ivanich took a deep breath and lighted his pipe before beginning his
      story, but just then the rain began to fall. And in about five minutes it
      came pelting down and showed no signs of stopping. Ivan Ivanich stopped
      and hesitated; the dogs, wet through, stood with their tails between their
      legs and looked at them mournfully.
    

      "We ought to take shelter," said Bourkin. "Let us go to Aliokhin. It is
      close by."
    

      "Very well."
    

      They took a short cut over a stubble-field and then bore to the right,
      until they came to the road. Soon there appeared poplars, a garden, the
      red roofs of granaries; the river began to glimmer and they came to a wide
      road with a mill and a white bathing-shed. It was Sophino, where Aliokhin
      lived.
    

      The mill was working, drowning the sound of the rain, and the dam shook.
      Round the carts stood wet horses, hanging their heads, and men were
      walking about with their heads covered with sacks. It was wet, muddy, and
      unpleasant, and the river looked cold and sullen. Ivan Ivanich and Bourkin
      felt wet and uncomfortable through and through; their feet were tired with
      walking in the mud, and they walked past the dam to the barn in silence as
      though they were angry with each other.
    

      In one of the barns a winnowing-machine was working, sending out clouds of
      dust. On the threshold stood Aliokhin himself, a man of about forty, tall
      and stout, with long hair, more like a professor or a painter than a
      farmer. He was wearing a grimy white shirt and rope belt, and pants
      instead of trousers; and his boots were covered with mud and straw. His
      nose and eyes were black with dust. He recognised Ivan Ivanich and was
      apparently very pleased.
    

      "Please, gentlemen," he said, "go to the house. I'll be with you in a
      minute."
    

      The house was large and two-storied. Aliokhin lived down-stairs in two
      vaulted rooms with little windows designed for the farm-hands; the
      farmhouse was plain, and the place smelled of rye bread and vodka, and
      leather. He rarely used the reception-rooms, only when guests arrived.
      Ivan Ivanich and Bourkin were received by a chambermaid; such a pretty
      young woman that both of them stopped and exchanged glances.
    

      "You cannot imagine how glad I am to see you, gentlemen," said Aliokhin,
      coming after them into the hall. "I never expected you. Pelagueya," he
      said to the maid, "give my friends a change of clothes. And I will change,
      too. But I must have a bath. I haven't had one since the spring. Wouldn't
      you like to come to the bathing-shed? And meanwhile our things will be got
      ready."
    

      Pretty Pelagueya, dainty and sweet, brought towels and soap, and Aliokhin
      led his guests to the bathing-shed.
    

      "Yes," he said, "it is a long time since I had a bath. My bathing-shed is
      all right, as you see. My father and I put it up, but somehow I have no
      time to bathe."
    

      He sat down on the step and lathered his long hair and neck, and the water
      round him became brown.
    

      "Yes. I see," said Ivan Ivanich heavily, looking at his head.
    

      "It is a long time since I bathed," said Aliokhin shyly, as he soaped
      himself again, and the water round him became dark blue, like ink.
    

      Ivan Ivanich came out of the shed, plunged into the water with a splash,
      and swam about in the rain, flapping his arms, and sending waves back, and
      on the waves tossed white lilies; he swam out to the middle of the pool
      and dived, and in a minute came up again in another place and kept on
      swimming and diving, trying to reach the bottom. "Ah! how delicious!" he
      shouted in his glee. "How delicious!" He swam to the mill, spoke to the
      peasants, and came back, and in the middle of the pool he lay on his back
      to let the rain fall on his face. Bourkin and Aliokhin were already
      dressed and ready to go, but he kept on swimming and diving.
    

      "Delicious," he said. "Too delicious!"
    

      "You've had enough," shouted Bourkin.
    

      They went to the house. And only when the lamp was lit in the large
      drawing-room up-stairs, and Bourkin and Ivan Ivanich, dressed in silk
      dressing-gowns and warm slippers, lounged in chairs, and Aliokhin himself,
      washed and brushed, in a new frock coat, paced up and down evidently
      delighting in the warmth and cleanliness and dry clothes and slippers, and
      pretty Pelagueya, noiselessly tripping over the carpet and smiling
      sweetly, brought in tea and jam on a tray, only then did Ivan Ivanich
      begin his story, and it was as though he was being listened to not only by
      Bourkin and Aliokhin, but also by the old and young ladies and the officer
      who looked down so staidly and tranquilly from the golden frames.
    

      "We are two brothers," he began, "I, Ivan Ivanich, and Nicholai Ivanich,
      two years younger. I went in for study and became a veterinary surgeon,
      while Nicholai was at the Exchequer Court when he was nineteen. Our
      father, Tchimasha-Himalaysky, was a cantonist, but he died with an
      officer's rank and left us his title of nobility and a small estate. After
      his death the estate went to pay his debts. However, we spent our
      childhood there in the country. We were just like peasant's children,
      spent days and nights in the fields and the woods, minded the house,
      barked the lime-trees, fished, and so on.... And you know once a man has
      fished, or watched the thrushes hovering in flocks over the village in the
      bright, cool, autumn days, he can never really be a townsman, and to the
      day of his death he will be drawn to the country. My brother pined away in
      the Exchequer. Years passed and he sat in the same place, wrote out the
      same documents, and thought of one thing, how to get back to the country.
      And little by little his distress became a definite disorder, a fixed idea—to
      buy a small farm somewhere by the bank of a river or a lake.
    

      "He was a good fellow and I loved him, but I never sympathised with the
      desire to shut oneself up on one's own farm. It is a common saying that a
      man needs only six feet of land. But surely a corpse wants that, not a
      man. And I hear that our intellectuals have a longing for the land and
      want to acquire farms. But it all comes down to the six feet of land. To
      leave town, and the struggle and the swim of life, and go and hide
      yourself in a farmhouse is not life—it is egoism, laziness; it is a
      kind of monasticism, but monasticism without action. A man needs, not six
      feet of land, not a farm, but the whole earth, all Nature, where in full
      liberty he can display all the properties and qualities of the free
      spirit.
    

      "My brother Nicholai, sitting in his office, would dream of eating his own
      schi, with its savoury smell floating across the farmyard; and of
      eating out in the open air, and of sleeping in the sun, and of sitting for
      hours together on a seat by the gate and gazing at the field and the
      forest. Books on agriculture and the hints in almanacs were his joy, his
      favourite spiritual food; and he liked reading newspapers, but only the
      advertisements of land to be sold, so many acres of arable and grass land,
      with a farmhouse, river, garden, mill, and mill-pond. And he would dream
      of garden-walls, flowers, fruits, nests, carp in the pond, don't you know,
      and all the rest of it. These fantasies of his used to vary according to
      the advertisements he found, but somehow there was always a
      gooseberry-bush in every one. Not a house, not a romantic spot could he
      imagine without its gooseberry-bush.
    

      "'Country life has its advantages,' he used to say. 'You sit on the
      veranda drinking tea and your ducklings swim on the pond, and everything
      smells good ... and there are gooseberries.'
    

      "He used to draw out a plan of his estate and always the same things were
      shown on it: (a) Farmhouse, (b) cottage, (c)
      vegetable garden, (d) gooseberry-bush. He used to live meagrely and
      never had enough to eat and drink, dressed God knows how, exactly like a
      beggar, and always saved and put his money into the bank. He was terribly
      stingy. It used to hurt me to see him, and I used to give him money to go
      away for a holiday, but he would put that away, too. Once a man gets a
      fixed idea, there's nothing to be done.
    

      "Years passed; he was transferred to another province. He completed his
      fortieth year and was still reading advertisements in the papers and
      saving up his money. Then I heard he was married. Still with the same idea
      of buying a farmhouse with a gooseberry-bush, he married an elderly, ugly
      widow, not out of any feeling for her, but because she had money. With her
      he still lived stingily, kept her half-starved, and put the money into the
      bank in his own name. She had been the wife of a postmaster and was used
      to good living, but with her second husband she did not even have enough
      black bread; she pined away in her new life, and in three years or so gave
      up her soul to God. And my brother never for a moment thought himself to
      blame for her death. Money, like vodka, can play queer tricks with a man.
      Once in our town a merchant lay dying. Before his death he asked for some
      honey, and he ate all his notes and scrip with the honey so that nobody
      should get it. Once I was examining a herd of cattle at a station and a
      horse-jobber fell under the engine, and his foot was cut off. We carried
      him into the waiting-room, with the blood pouring down—a terrible
      business—and all the while he kept on asking anxiously for his foot;
      he had twenty-five roubles in his boot and did not want to lose them."
    

      "Keep to your story," said Bourkin.
    

      "After the death of his wife," Ivan Ivanich continued, after a long pause,
      "my brother began to look out for an estate. Of course you may search for
      five years, and even then buy a pig in a poke. Through an agent my brother
      Nicholai raised a mortgage and bought three hundred acres with a
      farmhouse, a cottage, and a park, but there was no orchard, no
      gooseberry-bush, no duck-pond; there was a river but the water in it was
      coffee-coloured because the estate lay between a brick-yard and a gelatine
      factory. But my brother Nicholai was not worried about that; he ordered
      twenty gooseberry-bushes and settled down to a country life.
    

      "Last year I paid him a visit. I thought I'd go and see how things were
      with him. In his letters my brother called his estate Tchimbarshov Corner,
      or Himalayskoe. I arrived at Himalayskoe in the afternoon. It was hot.
      There were ditches, fences, hedges, rows of young fir-trees, trees
      everywhere, and there was no telling how to cross the yard or where to put
      your horse. I went to the house and was met by a red-haired dog, as fat as
      a pig. He tried to bark but felt too lazy. Out of the kitchen came the
      cook, barefooted, and also as fat as a pig, and said that the master was
      having his afternoon rest. I went in to my brother and found him sitting
      on his bed with his knees covered with a blanket; he looked old, stout,
      flabby; his cheeks, nose, and lips were pendulous. I half expected him to
      grunt like a pig.
    

      "We embraced and shed a tear of joy and also of sadness to think that we
      had once been young, but were now both going grey and nearing death. He
      dressed and took me to see his estate.
    

      "'Well? How are you getting on?' I asked.
    

      "'All right, thank God. I am doing very well.'
    

      "He was no longer the poor, tired official, but a real landowner and a
      person of consequence. He had got used to the place and liked it, ate a
      great deal, took Russian baths, was growing fat, had already gone to law
      with the parish and the two factories, and was much offended if the
      peasants did not call him 'Your Lordship.' And, like a good landowner, he
      looked after his soul and did good works pompously, never simply. What
      good works? He cured the peasants of all kinds of diseases with soda and
      castor-oil, and on his birthday he would have a thanksgiving service held
      in the middle of the village, and would treat the peasants to half a
      bucket of vodka, which he thought the right thing to do. Ah! Those
      horrible buckets of vodka. One day a greasy landowner will drag the
      peasants before the Zembro Court for trespass, and the next, if it's a
      holiday, he will give them a bucket of vodka, and they drink and shout
      Hooray! and lick his boots in their drunkenness. A change to good eating
      and idleness always fills a Russian with the most preposterous
      self-conceit. Nicholai Ivanich who, when he was in the Exchequer, was
      terrified to have an opinion of his own, now imagined that what he said
      was law. 'Education is necessary for the masses, but they are not fit for
      it.' 'Corporal punishment is generally harmful, but in certain cases it is
      useful and indispensable.'
    

      "'I know the people and I know how to treat them,' he would say. 'The
      people love me. I have only to raise my finger and they will do as I
      wish.'
    

      "And all this, mark you, was said with a kindly smile of wisdom. He was
      constantly saying: 'We noblemen,' or 'I, as a nobleman.' Apparently he had
      forgotten that our grandfather was a peasant and our father a common
      soldier. Even our family name, Tchimacha-Himalaysky, which is really an
      absurd one, seemed to him full-sounding, distinguished, and very pleasing.
    

      "But my point does not concern him so much as myself. I want to tell you
      what a change took place in me in those few hours while I was in his
      house. In the evening, while we were having tea, the cook laid a plateful
      of gooseberries on the table. They had not been bought, but were his own
      gooseberries, plucked for the first time since the bushes were planted.
      Nicholai Ivanich laughed with joy and for a minute or two he looked in
      silence at the gooseberries with tears in his eyes. He could not speak for
      excitement, then put one into his mouth, glanced at me in triumph, like a
      child at last being given its favourite toy, and said:
    

      "'How good they are!'
    

      "He went on eating greedily, and saying all the while:
    

      "'How good they are! Do try one!'
    

      "It was hard and sour, but, as Poushkin said, the illusion which exalts us
      is dearer to us than ten thousand truths. I saw a happy man, one whose
      dearest dream had come true, who had attained his goal in life, who had
      got what he wanted, and was pleased with his destiny and with himself. In
      my idea of human life there is always some alloy of sadness, but now at
      the sight of a happy man I was filled with something like despair. And at
      night it grew on me. A bed was made up for me in the room near my
      brother's and I could hear him, unable to sleep, going again and again to
      the plate of gooseberries. I thought: 'After all, what a lot of contented,
      happy people there must be! What an overwhelming power that means! I look
      at this life and see the arrogance and the idleness of the strong, the
      ignorance and bestiality of the weak, the horrible poverty everywhere,
      overcrowding, drunkenness, hypocrisy, falsehood.... Meanwhile in all the
      houses, all the streets, there is peace; out of fifty thousand people who
      live in our town there is not one to kick against it all. Think of the
      people who go to the market for food: during the day they eat; at night
      they sleep, talk nonsense, marry, grow old, piously follow their dead to
      the cemetery; one never sees or hears those who suffer, and all the horror
      of life goes on somewhere behind the scenes. Everything is quiet,
      peaceful, and against it all there is only the silent protest of
      statistics; so many go mad, so many gallons are drunk, so many children
      die of starvation.... And such a state of things is obviously what we
      want; apparently a happy man only feels so because the unhappy bear their
      burden in silence, but for which happiness would be impossible. It is a
      general hypnosis. Every happy man should have some one with a little
      hammer at his door to knock and remind him that there are unhappy people,
      and that, however happy he may be, life will sooner or later show its
      claws, and some misfortune will befall him—illness, poverty, loss,
      and then no one will see or hear him, just as he now neither sees nor
      hears others. But there is no man with a hammer, and the happy go on
      living, just a little fluttered with the petty cares of every day, like an
      aspen-tree in the wind—and everything is all right.'
    

      "That night I was able to understand how I, too, had been content and
      happy," Ivan Ivanich went on, getting up. "I, too, at meals or out
      hunting, used to lay down the law about living, and religion, and
      governing the masses. I, too, used to say that teaching is light, that
      education is necessary, but that for simple folk reading and writing is
      enough for the present. Freedom is a boon, I used to say, as essential as
      the air we breathe, but we must wait. Yes—I used to say so, but now
      I ask: 'Why do we wait?'" Ivan Ivanich glanced angrily at Bourkin. "Why do
      we wait, I ask you? What considerations keep us fast? I am told that we
      cannot have everything at once, and that every idea is realised in time.
      But who says so? Where is the proof that it is so? You refer me to the
      natural order of things, to the law of cause and effect, but is there
      order or natural law in that I, a living, thinking creature, should stand
      by a ditch until it fills up, or is narrowed, when I could jump it or
      throw a bridge over it? Tell me, I say, why should we wait? Wait, when we
      have no strength to live, and yet must live and are full of the desire to
      live!
    

      "I left my brother early the next morning, and from that time on I found
      it impossible to live in town. The peace and the quiet of it oppress me. I
      dare not look in at the windows, for nothing is more dreadful to see than
      the sight of a happy family, sitting round a table, having tea. I am an
      old man now and am no good for the struggle. I commenced late. I can only
      grieve within my soul, and fret and sulk. At night my head buzzes with the
      rush of my thoughts and I cannot sleep.... Ah! If I were young!"
    

      Ivan Ivanich walked excitedly up and down the room and repeated:
    

      "If I were young."
    

      He suddenly walked up to Aliokhin and shook him first by one hand and then
      by the other.
    

      "Pavel Konstantinich," he said in a voice of entreaty, "don't be
      satisfied, don't let yourself be lulled to sleep! While you are young,
      strong, wealthy, do not cease to do good! Happiness does not exist, nor
      should it, and if there is any meaning or purpose in life, they are not in
      our peddling little happiness, but in something reasonable and grand. Do
      good!"
    

      Ivan Ivanich said this with a piteous supplicating smile, as though he
      were asking a personal favour.
    

      Then they all three sat in different corners of the drawing-room and were
      silent. Ivan Ivanich's story had satisfied neither Bourkin nor Aliokhin.
      With the generals and ladies looking down from their gilt frames, seeming
      alive in the firelight, it was tedious to hear the story of a miserable
      official who ate gooseberries.... Somehow they had a longing to hear and
      to speak of charming people, and of women. And the mere fact of sitting in
      the drawing-room where everything—the lamp with its coloured shade,
      the chairs, and the carpet under their feet—told how the very people
      who now looked down at them from their frames once walked, and sat and had
      tea there, and the fact that pretty Pelagueya was near—was much
      better than any story.
    

      Aliokhin wanted very much to go to bed; he had to get up for his work very
      early, about two in the morning, and now his eyes were closing, but he was
      afraid of his guests saying something interesting without his hearing it,
      so he would not go. He did not trouble to think whether what Ivan Ivanich
      had been saying was clever or right; his guests were talking of neither
      groats, nor hay, nor tar, but of something which had no bearing on his
      life, and he liked it and wanted them to go on....
    

      "However, it's time to go to bed," said Bourkin, getting up. "I will wish
      you good night."
    

      Aliokhin said good night and went down-stairs, and left his guests. Each
      had a large room with an old wooden bed and carved ornaments; in the
      corner was an ivory crucifix; and their wide, cool beds, made by pretty
      Pelagueya, smelled sweetly of clean linen.
    

      Ivan Ivanich undressed in silence and lay down.
    

      "God forgive me, a wicked sinner," he murmured, as he drew the clothes
      over his head.
    

      A smell of burning tobacco came from his pipe which lay on the table, and
      Bourkin could not sleep for a long time and was worried because he could
      not make out where the unpleasant smell came from.
    

      The rain beat against the windows all night long.
    

IN EXILE
    

OLD Simeon, whose nickname was Brains, and a young
      Tartar, whose name nobody knew, were sitting on the bank of the river by a
      wood-fire. The other three ferrymen were in the hut. Simeon who was an old
      man of about sixty, skinny and toothless, but broad-shouldered and
      healthy, was drunk. He would long ago have gone to bed, but he had a
      bottle in his pocket and was afraid of his comrades asking him for vodka.
      The Tartar was ill and miserable, and, pulling his rags about him, he went
      on talking about the good things in the province of Simbirsk, and what a
      beautiful and clever wife he had left at home. He was not more than
      twenty-five, and now, by the light of the wood-fire, with his pale,
      sorrowful, sickly face, he looked a mere boy.
    

      "Of course, it is not a paradise here," said Brains, "you see, water, the
      bare bushes by the river, clay everywhere—nothing else.... It is
      long past Easter and there is still ice on the water and this morning
      there was snow...."
    

      "Bad! Bad!" said the Tartar with a frightened look.
    

      A few yards away flowed the dark, cold river, muttering, dashing against
      the holes in the clayey banks as it tore along to the distant sea. By the
      bank they were sitting on, loomed a great barge, which the ferrymen call a
      karbass. Far away and away, flashing out, flaring up, were fires
      crawling like snakes—last year's grass being burned. And behind the
      water again was darkness. Little banks of ice could be heard knocking
      against the barge.... It was very damp and cold....
    

      The Tartar glanced at the sky. There were as many stars as at home, and
      the darkness was the same, but something was missing. At home in the
      Simbirsk province the stars and the sky were altogether different.
    

      "Bad! Bad!" he repeated.
    

      "You will get used to it," said Brains with a laugh. "You are young yet
      and foolish; the milk is hardly dry on your lips, and in your folly you
      imagine that there is no one unhappier than you, but there will come a
      time when you will say: God give every one such a life! Just look at me.
      In a week's time the floods will be gone, and we will fix the ferry here,
      and all of you will go away into Siberia and I shall stay here, going to
      and fro. I have been living thus for the last two-and-twenty years, but,
      thank God, I want nothing. God give everybody such a life."
    

      The Tartar threw some branches onto the fire, crawled near to it and said:
    

      "My father is sick. When he dies, my mother and my wife have promised to
      come here."
    

      "What do you want your mother and your wife for?" asked Brains. "Just
      foolishness, my friend. It's the devil tempting you, plague take him.
      Don't listen to the Evil One. Don't give way to him. When he talks to you
      about women you should answer him sharply: 'I don't want them!' When he
      talks of freedom, you should stick to it and say: 'I don't want it. I want
      nothing! No father, no mother, no wife, no freedom, no home, no love! I
      want nothing.' Plague take 'em all."
    

      Brains took a swig at his bottle and went on:
    

      "My brother, I am not an ordinary peasant. I don't come from the servile
      masses. I am the son of a deacon, and when I was a free man at Rursk, I
      used to wear a frock coat, and now I have brought myself to such a point
      that I can sleep naked on the ground and eat grass. God give such a life
      to everybody. I want nothing. I am afraid of nobody and I think there is
      no man richer or freer than I. When they sent me here from Russia I set my
      teeth at once and said: 'I want nothing!' The devil whispers to me about
      my wife and my kindred, and about freedom and I say to him: 'I want
      nothing!' I stuck to it, and, you see, I live happily and have nothing to
      grumble at. If a man gives the devil the least opportunity and listens to
      him just once, then he is lost and has no hope of salvation: he will be
      over ears in the mire and will never get out. Not only peasants the like
      of you are lost, but the nobly born and the educated also. About fifteen
      years ago a certain nobleman was sent here from Russia. He had had some
      trouble with his brothers and had made a forgery in a will. People said he
      was a prince or a baron, but perhaps he was only a high official—who
      knows? Well, he came here and at once bought a house and land in
      Moukhzyink. 'I want to live by my own work,' said he, 'in the sweat of my
      brow, because I am no longer a nobleman but an exile.' 'Why,' said I. 'God
      help you, for that is good.' He was a young man then, ardent and eager; he
      used to mow and go fishing, and he would ride sixty miles on horseback.
      Only one thing was wrong; from the very beginning he was always driving to
      the post-office at Guyrin. He used to sit in my boat and sigh: 'Ah!
      Simeon, it is a long time since they sent me any money from home.' 'You
      are better without money, Vassili Sergnevich,' said I. 'What's the good of
      it? You just throw away the past, as though it had never happened, as
      though it were only a dream, and start life afresh. Don't listen to the
      devil,' I said, 'he won't do you any good, and he will only tighten the
      noose. You want money now, but in a little while you will want something
      else, and then more and more. If,' said I, 'you want to be happy you must
      want nothing. Exactly.... If,' I said, 'fate has been hard on you and me,
      it is no good asking her for charity and falling at her feet. We must
      ignore her and laugh at her.' That's what I said to him.... Two years
      later I ferried him over and he rubbed his hands and laughed. 'I'm going,'
      said he, 'to Guyrin to meet my wife. She has taken pity on me, she says,
      and she is coming here. She is very kind and good.' And he gave a gasp of
      joy. Then one day he came with his wife, a beautiful young lady with a
      little girl in her arms and a lot of luggage. And Vassili Andreich kept
      turning and looking at her and could not look at her or praise her enough.
      'Yes, Simeon, my friend, even in Siberia people live.' Well, thought I,
      all right, you won't be content. And from that time on, mark you, he used
      to go to Guyrin every week to find out if money had been sent from Russia.
      A terrible lot of money was wasted. 'She stays here,' said he, 'for my
      sake, and her youth and beauty wither away here in Siberia. She shares my
      bitter lot with me,' said he, 'and I must give her all the pleasure I can
      for it....' To make his wife happier he took up with the officials and any
      kind of rubbish. And they couldn't have company without giving food and
      drink, and they must have a piano and a fluffy little dog on the sofa—bad
      cess to it.... Luxury, in a word, all kinds of tricks. My lady did not
      stay with him long. How could she? Clay, water, cold, no vegetables, no
      fruit; uneducated people and drunkards, with no manners, and she was a
      pretty pampered young lady from the metropolis.... Of course she got
      bored. And her husband was no longer a gentleman, but an exile—quite
      a different matter. Three years later, I remember, on the eve of the
      Assumption, I heard shouts from the other bank. I went over in the ferry
      and saw my lady, all wrapped up, with a young gentleman, a government
      official, in a troika.... I ferried them across, they got into the
      carriage and disappeared, and I saw no more of them. Toward the morning
      Vassili Andreich came racing up in a coach and pair. 'Has my wife been
      across, Simeon, with a gentleman in spectacles?' 'She has,' said I, 'but
      you might as well look for the wind in the fields.' He raced after them
      and kept it up for five days and nights. When he came back he jumped on to
      the ferry and began to knock his head against the side and to cry aloud.
      'You see,' said I, 'there you are.' And I laughed and reminded him: 'Even
      in Siberia people live.' But he went on beating his head harder than
      ever.... Then he got the desire for freedom. His wife had gone to Russia
      and he longed to go there to see her and take her away from her lover. And
      he began to go to the post-office every day, and then to the authorities
      of the town. He was always sending applications or personally handing them
      to the authorities, asking to have his term remitted and to be allowed to
      go, and he told me that he had spent over two hundred roubles on
      telegrams. He sold his land and mortgaged his house to the money-lenders.
      His hair went grey, he grew round-shouldered, and his face got yellow and
      consumptive-looking. He used to cough whenever he spoke and tears used to
      come to his eyes. He spent eight years on his applications, and at last he
      became happy again and lively: he had thought of a new dodge. His
      daughter, you see, had grown up. He doted on her and could never take his
      eyes off her. And, indeed, she was very pretty, dark and clever. Every
      Sunday he used to go to church with her at Guyrin. They would stand side
      by side on the ferry, and she would smile and he would devour her with his
      eyes. 'Yes, Simeon,' he would say. 'Even in Siberia people live. Even in
      Siberia there is happiness. Look what a fine daughter I have. You wouldn't
      find one like her in a thousand miles' journey.' 'She's a nice girl,' said
      I. 'Oh, yes.' ... And I thought to myself: 'You wait.... She is young.
      Young blood will have its way; she wants to live and what life is there
      here?' And she began to pine away.... Wasting, wasting away, she withered
      away, fell ill and had to keep to her bed.... Consumption. That's Siberian
      happiness, plague take it; that's Siberian life.... He rushed all over the
      place after the doctors and dragged them home with him. If he heard of a
      doctor or a quack three hundred miles off he would rush off after him. He
      spent a terrific amount of money on doctors and I think it would have been
      much better spent on drink. All the same she had to die. No help for it.
      Then it was all up with him. He thought of hanging himself, and of trying
      to escape to Russia. That would be the end of him. He would try to escape:
      he would be caught, tried, penal servitude, flogging."
    

      "Good! Good!" muttered the Tartar with a shiver.
    

      "What is good?" asked Brains.
    

      "Wife and daughter. What does penal servitude and suffering matter? He saw
      his wife and his daughter. You say one should want nothing. But nothing—is
      evil! His wife spent three years with him. God gave him that. Nothing is
      evil, and three years is good. Why don't you understand that?"
    

      Trembling and stammering as he groped for Russian words, of which he knew
      only a few, the Tartar began to say: "God forbid he should fall ill among
      strangers, and die and be buried in the cold sodden earth, and then, if
      his wife could come to him if only for one day or even for one hour, he
      would gladly endure any torture for such happiness, and would even thank
      God. Better one day of happiness than nothing."
    

      Then once more he said what a beautiful clever wife he had left at home,
      and with his head in his hands he began to cry and assured Simeon that he
      was innocent, and had been falsely accused. His two brothers and his uncle
      had stolen some horses from a peasant and beat the old man nearly to
      death, and the community never looked into the matter at all, and judgment
      was passed by which all three brothers were exiled to Siberia, while his
      uncle, a rich man, remained at home.
    

      "You will get used to it," said Simeon.
    

      The Tartar relapsed into silence and stared into the fire with his eyes
      red from weeping; he looked perplexed and frightened, as if he could not
      understand why he was in the cold and the darkness, among strangers, and
      not in the province of Simbirsk. Brains lay down near the fire, smiled at
      something, and began to say in an undertone:
    

      "But what a joy she must be to your father," he muttered after a pause.
      "He loves her and she is a comfort to him, eh? But, my man, don't tell me.
      He is a strict, harsh old man. And girls don't want strictness; they want
      kisses and laughter, scents and pomade. Yes.... Ah! What a life!" Simeon
      swore heavily. "No more vodka! That means bedtime. What? I'm going, my
      man."
    

      Left alone, the Tartar threw more branches on the fire, lay down, and,
      looking into the blaze, began to think of his native village and of his
      wife; if she could come if only for a month, or even a day, and then, if
      she liked, go back again! Better a month or even a day, than nothing. But
      even if his wife kept her promise and came, how could he provide for her?
      Where was she to live?
    

      "If there is nothing to eat; how are we to live?" asked the Tartar aloud.
    

      For working at the oars day and night he was paid two copecks a day; the
      passengers gave tips, but the ferrymen shared them out and gave nothing to
      the Tartar, and only laughed at him. And he was poor, cold, hungry, and
      fearful.... With his whole body aching and shivering he thought it would
      be good to go into the hut and sleep; but there was nothing to cover
      himself with, and it was colder there than on the bank. He had nothing to
      cover himself with there, but he could make up a fire....
    

      In a week's time, when the floods had subsided and the ferry would be
      fixed up, all the ferrymen except Simeon would not be wanted any longer
      and the Tartar would have to go from village to village, begging and
      looking for work. His wife was only seventeen; beautiful, soft, and
      shy.... Could she go unveiled begging through the villages? No. The idea
      of it was horrible.
    

      It was already dawn. The barges, the bushy willows above the water, the
      swirling flood began to take shape, and up above in a clayey cliff a hut
      thatched with straw, and above that the straggling houses of the village,
      where the cocks had begun to crow.
    

      The ginger-coloured clay cliff, the barge, the river, the strange wild
      people, hunger, cold, illness—perhaps all these things did not
      really exist. Perhaps, thought the Tartar, it was only a dream. He felt
      that he must be asleep, and he heard his own snoring.... Certainly he was
      at home in the Simbirsk province; he had but to call his wife and she
      would answer; and his mother was in the next room.... But what awful
      dreams there are! Why? The Tartar smiled and opened his eyes. What river
      was that? The Volga?
    

      It was snowing.
    

      "Hi! Ferry!" some one shouted on the other bank. "Karba-a-ass!"
    

      The Tartar awoke and went to fetch his mates to row over to the other
      side. Hurrying into their sheepskins, swearing sleepily in hoarse voices,
      and shivering from the cold, the four men appeared on the bank. After
      their sleep, the river from which there came a piercing blast, seemed to
      them horrible and disgusting. They stepped slowly into the barge.... The
      Tartar and the three ferrymen took the long, broad-bladed oars, which in
      the dim light looked like a crab's claw, and Simeon flung himself with his
      belly against the tiller. And on the other side the voice kept on
      shouting, and a revolver was fired twice, for the man probably thought the
      ferrymen were asleep or gone to the village inn.
    

      "All right. Plenty of time!" said Brains in the tone of one who was
      convinced that there is no need for hurry in this world—and indeed
      there is no reason for it.
    

      The heavy, clumsy barge left the bank and heaved through the willows, and
      by the willows slowly receding it was possible to tell that the barge was
      moving. The ferrymen plied the oars with a slow measured stroke; Brains
      hung over the tiller with his stomach pressed against it and swung from
      side to side. In the dim light they looked like men sitting on some
      antediluvian animal with long limbs, swimming out to a cold dismal
      nightmare country.
    

      They got clear of the willows and swung out into mid-stream. The thud of
      the oars and the splash could be heard on the other bank and shouts came:
      "Quicker! Quicker!" After another ten minutes the barge bumped heavily
      against the landing-stage.
    

      "And it is still snowing, snowing all the time," Simeon murmured, wiping
      the snow off his face. "God knows where it comes from!"
    

      On the other side a tall, lean old man was waiting in a short fox-fur coat
      and a white astrachan hat. He was standing some distance from his horses
      and did not move; he had a stern concentrated expression as if he were
      trying to remember something and were furious with his recalcitrant
      memory. When Simeon went up to him and took off his hat with a smile he
      said:
    

      "I'm in a hurry to get to Anastasievka. My daughter is worse again and
      they tell me there's a new doctor at Anastasievka."
    

      The coach was clamped onto the barge and they rowed back. All the while as
      they rowed the man, whom Simeon called Vassili Andreich, stood motionless,
      pressing his thick lips tight and staring in front of him. When the driver
      craved leave to smoke in his presence, he answered nothing, as if he did
      not hear. And Simeon hung over the rudder and looked at him mockingly and
      said:
    

      "Even in Siberia people live. L-i-v-e!"
    

      On Brains's face was a triumphant expression as if he were proving
      something, as if pleased that things had happened just as he thought they
      would. The unhappy, helpless look of the man in the fox-fur coat seemed to
      give him great pleasure.
    

      "The roads are now muddy, Vassili Andreich," he said, when the horses had
      been harnessed on the bank. "You'd better wait a couple of weeks, until it
      gets dryer.... If there were any point in going—but you know
      yourself that people are always on the move day and night and there's no
      point in it. Sure!"
    

      Vassili Andreich said nothing, gave him a tip, took his seat in the coach
      and drove away.
    

      "Look! He's gone galloping after the doctor!" said Simeon, shivering in
      the cold. "Yes. To look for a real doctor, trying to overtake the wind in
      the fields, and catch the devil by the tail, plague take him! What queer
      fish there are! God forgive me, a miserable sinner."
    

      The Tartar went up to Brains, and, looking at him with mingled hatred and
      disgust, trembling, and mixing Tartar words up with his broken Russian,
      said:
    

      "He good ... good. And you ... bad! You are bad! The gentleman is a good
      soul, very good, and you are a beast, you are bad! The gentleman is alive
      and you are dead.... God made man that he should be alive, that he should
      have happiness, sorrow, grief, and you want nothing, so you are not alive,
      but a stone! A stone wants nothing and so do you.... You are a stone—and
      God does not love you and the gentleman he does."
    

      They all began to laugh: the Tartar furiously knit his brows, waved his
      hand, drew his rags round him and went to the fire. The ferrymen and
      Simeon went slowly to the hut.
    

      "It's cold," said one of the ferrymen hoarsely, as he stretched himself on
      the straw with which the damp, clay floor was covered.
    

      "Yes. It's not warm," another agreed.... "It's a hard life."
    

      All of them lay down. The wind blew the door open. The snow drifted into
      the hut. Nobody could bring himself to get up and shut the door; it was
      cold, but they put up with it.
    

      "And I am happy," muttered Simeon as he fell asleep. "God give such a life
      to everybody."
    

      "You certainly are the devil's own. Even the devil don't need to take
      you."
    

      Sounds like the barking of a dog came from outside.
    

      "Who is that? Who is there?"
    

      "It's the Tartar crying."
    

      "Oh! he's a queer fish."
    

      "He'll get used to it!" said Simeon, and at once he fell asleep. Soon the
      others slept too and the door was left open.
    

THE
      LADY WITH THE TOY DOG
    

IT was reported that a new face had been seen on
      the quay; a lady with a little dog. Dimitri Dimitrich Gomov, who had been
      a fortnight at Talta and had got used to it, had begun to show an interest
      in new faces. As he sat in the pavilion at Verné's he saw a young
      lady, blond and fairly tall, and wearing a broad-brimmed hat, pass along
      the quay. After her ran a white Pomeranian.
    

      Later he saw her in the park and in the square several times a day. She
      walked by herself, always in the same broad-brimmed hat, and with this
      white dog. Nobody knew who she was, and she was spoken of as the lady with
      the toy dog.
    

      "If," thought Gomov, "if she is here without a husband or a friend, it
      would be as well to make her acquaintance."
    

      He was not yet forty, but he had a daughter of twelve and two boys at
      school. He had married young, in his second year at the University, and
      now his wife seemed half as old again as himself. She was a tall woman,
      with dark eyebrows, erect, grave, stolid, and she thought herself an
      intellectual woman. She read a great deal, called her husband not Dimitri,
      but Demitri, and in his private mind he thought her short-witted,
      narrow-minded, and ungracious. He was afraid of her and disliked being at
      home. He had begun to betray her with other women long ago, betrayed her
      frequently, and, probably for that reason nearly always spoke ill of
      women, and when they were discussed in his presence he would maintain that
      they were an inferior race.
    

      It seemed to him that his experience was bitter enough to give him the
      right to call them any name he liked, but he could not live a couple of
      days without the "inferior race." With men he was bored and ill at ease,
      cold and unable to talk, but when he was with women, he felt easy and knew
      what to talk about, and how to behave, and even when he was silent with
      them he felt quite comfortable. In his appearance as in his character,
      indeed in his whole nature, there was something attractive, indefinable,
      which drew women to him and charmed them; he knew it, and he, too, was
      drawn by some mysterious power to them.
    

      His frequent, and, indeed, bitter experiences had taught him long ago that
      every affair of that kind, at first a divine diversion, a delicious smooth
      adventure, is in the end a source of worry for a decent man, especially
      for men like those at Moscow who are slow to move, irresolute,
      domesticated, for it becomes at last an acute and extraordinary
      complicated problem and a nuisance. But whenever he met and was interested
      in a new woman, then his experience would slip away from his memory, and
      he would long to live, and everything would seem so simple and amusing.
    

      And it so happened that one evening he dined in the gardens, and the lady
      in the broad-brimmed hat came up at a leisurely pace and sat at the next
      table. Her expression, her gait, her dress, her coiffure told him that she
      belonged to society, that she was married, that she was paying her first
      visit to Talta, that she was alone, and that she was bored.... There is a
      great deal of untruth in the gossip about the immorality of the place. He
      scorned such tales, knowing that they were for the most part concocted by
      people who would be only too ready to sin if they had the chance, but when
      the lady sat down at the next table, only a yard or two away from him, his
      thoughts were filled with tales of easy conquests, of trips to the
      mountains; and he was suddenly possessed by the alluring idea of a quick
      transitory liaison, a moment's affair with an unknown woman whom he knew
      not even by name.
    

      He beckoned to the little dog, and when it came up to him, wagged his
      finger at it. The dog began to growl. Gomov again wagged his finger.
    

      The lady glanced at him and at once cast her eyes down.
    

      "He won't bite," she said and blushed.
    

      "May I give him a bone?"—and when she nodded emphatically, he asked
      affably: "Have you been in Talta long?"
    

      "About five days."
    

      "And I am just dragging through my second week."
    

      They were silent for a while.
    

      "Time goes quickly," she said, "and it is amazingly boring here."
    

      "It is the usual thing to say that it is boring here. People live quite
      happily in dull holes like Bieliev or Zhidra, but as soon as they come
      here they say: 'How boring it is! The very dregs of dullness!' One would
      think they came from Spain."
    

      She smiled. Then both went on eating in silence as though they did not
      know each other; but after dinner they went off together—and then
      began an easy, playful conversation as though they were perfectly happy,
      and it was all one to them where they went or what they talked of. They
      walked and talked of how the sea was strangely luminous; the water lilac,
      so soft and warm, and athwart it the moon cast a golden streak. They said
      how stifling it was after the hot day. Gomov told her how he came from
      Moscow and was a philologist by education, but in a bank by profession;
      and how he had once wanted to sing in opera, but gave it up; and how he
      had two houses in Moscow.... And from her he learned that she came from
      Petersburg, was born there, but married at S. where she had been living
      for the last two years; that she would stay another month at Talta, and
      perhaps her husband would come for her, because, he too, needed a rest.
      She could not tell him what her husband was—Provincial
      Administration or Zemstvo Council—and she seemed to think it funny.
      And Gomov found out that her name was Anna Sergueyevna.
    

      In his room at night, he thought of her and how they would meet next day.
      They must do so. As he was going to sleep, it struck him that she could
      only lately have left school, and had been at her lessons even as his
      daughter was then; he remembered how bashful and gauche she was when she
      laughed and talked with a stranger—it must be, he thought, the first
      time she had been alone, and in such a place with men walking after her
      and looking at her and talking to her, all with the same secret purpose
      which she could not but guess. He thought of her slender white neck and
      her pretty, grey eyes.
    

      "There is something touching about her," he thought as he began to fall
      asleep.
    

      II
    

      A week passed. It was a blazing day. Indoors it was stifling, and in the
      streets the dust whirled along. All day long he was plagued with thirst
      and he came into the pavilion every few minutes and offered Anna
      Sergueyevna an iced drink or an ice. It was impossibly hot.
    

      In the evening, when the air was fresher, they walked to the jetty to see
      the steamer come in. There was quite a crowd all gathered to meet
      somebody, for they carried bouquets. And among them were clearly marked
      the peculiarities of Talta: the elderly ladies were youngly dressed and
      there were many generals.
    

      The sea was rough and the steamer was late, and before it turned into the
      jetty it had to do a great deal of manœuvring. Anna Sergueyevna
      looked through her lorgnette at the steamer and the passengers as though
      she were looking for friends, and when she turned to Gomov, her eyes
      shone. She talked much and her questions were abrupt, and she forgot what
      she had said; and then she lost her lorgnette in the crowd.
    

      The well-dressed people went away, the wind dropped, and Gomov and Anna
      Sergueyevna stood as though they were waiting for somebody to come from
      the steamer. Anna Sergueyevna was silent. She smelled her flowers and did
      not look at Gomov.
    

      "The weather has got pleasanter toward evening," he said. "Where shall we
      go now? Shall we take a carriage?"
    

      She did not answer.
    

      He fixed his eyes on her and suddenly embraced her and kissed her lips,
      and he was kindled with the perfume and the moisture of the flowers; at
      once he started and looked round; had not some one seen?
    

      "Let us go to your—" he murmured.
    

      And they walked quickly away.
    

      Her room was stifling, and smelled of scents which she had bought at the
      Japanese shop. Gomov looked at her and thought: "What strange chances
      there are in life!" From the past there came the memory of earlier
      good-natured women, gay in their love, grateful to him for their
      happiness, short though it might be; and of others—like his wife—who
      loved without sincerity, and talked overmuch and affectedly, hysterically,
      as though they were protesting that it was not love, nor passion, but
      something more important; and of the few beautiful cold women, into whose
      eyes there would flash suddenly a fierce expression, a stubborn desire to
      take, to snatch from life more than it can give; they were no longer in
      their first youth, they were capricious, unstable, domineering, imprudent,
      and when Gomov became cold toward them then their beauty roused him to
      hatred, and the lace on their lingerie reminded him of the scales of fish.
    

      But here there was the shyness and awkwardness of inexperienced youth, a
      feeling of constraint; an impression of perplexity and wonder, as though
      some one had suddenly knocked at the door. Anna Sergueyevna, "the lady
      with the toy dog" took what had happened somehow seriously, with a
      particular gravity, as though thinking that this was her downfall and very
      strange and improper. Her features seemed to sink and wither, and on
      either side of her face her long hair hung mournfully down; she sat
      crestfallen and musing, exactly like a woman taken in sin in some old
      picture.
    

      "It is not right," she said. "You are the first to lose respect for me."
    

      There was a melon on the table. Gomov cut a slice and began to eat it
      slowly. At least half an hour passed in silence.
    

      Anna Sergueyevna was very touching; she irradiated the purity of a simple,
      devout, inexperienced woman; the solitary candle on the table hardly
      lighted her face, but it showed her very wretched.
    

      "Why should I cease to respect you?" asked Gomov. "You don't know what you
      are saying."
    

      "God forgive me!" she said, and her eyes filled with tears. "It is
      horrible."
    

      "You seem to want to justify yourself."
    

      "How can I justify myself? I am a wicked, low woman and I despise myself.
      I have no thought of justifying myself. It is not my husband that I have
      deceived, but myself. And not only now but for a long time past. My
      husband may be a good honest man, but he is a lackey. I do not know what
      work he does, but I do know that he is a lackey in his soul. I was twenty
      when I married him. I was overcome by curiosity. I longed for something.
      'Surely,' I said to myself, 'there is another kind of life.' I longed to
      live! To live, and to live.... Curiosity burned me up.... You do not
      understand it, but I swear by God, I could no longer control myself.
      Something strange was going on in me. I could not hold myself in. I told
      my husband that I was ill and came here.... And here I have been walking
      about dizzily, like a lunatic.... And now I have become a low, filthy
      woman whom everybody may despise."
    

      Gomov was already bored; her simple words irritated him with their
      unexpected and inappropriate repentance; but for the tears in her eyes he
      might have thought her to be joking or playing a part.
    

      "I do not understand," he said quietly. "What do you want?"
    

      She hid her face in his bosom and pressed close to him.
    

      "Believe, believe me, I implore you," she said. "I love a pure, honest
      life, and sin is revolting to me. I don't know myself what I am doing.
      Simple people say: 'The devil entrapped me,' and I can say of myself: 'The
      Evil One tempted me.'"
    

      "Don't, don't," he murmured.
    

      He looked into her staring, frightened eyes, kissed her, spoke quietly and
      tenderly, and gradually quieted her and she was happy again, and they both
      began to laugh.
    

      Later, when they went out, there was not a soul on the quay; the town with
      its cypresses looked like a city of the dead, but the sea still roared and
      broke against the shore; a boat swung on the waves; and in it sleepily
      twinkled the light of a lantern.
    

      They found a cab and drove out to the Oreanda.
    

      "Just now in the hall," said Gomov, "I discovered your name written on the
      board—von Didenitz. Is your husband a German?"
    

      "No. His grandfather, I believe, was a German, but he himself is an
      Orthodox Russian."
    

      At Oreanda they sat on a bench, not far from the church, looked down at
      the sea and were silent. Talta was hardly visible through the morning
      mist. The tops of the hills were shrouded in motionless white clouds. The
      leaves of the trees never stirred, the cicadas trilled, and the monotonous
      dull sound of the sea, coming up from below, spoke of the rest, the
      eternal sleep awaiting us. So the sea roared when there was neither Talta
      nor Oreanda, and so it roars and will roar, dully, indifferently when we
      shall be no more. And in this continual indifference to the life and death
      of each of us, lives pent up, the pledge of our eternal salvation, of the
      uninterrupted movement of life on earth and its unceasing perfection.
      Sitting side by side with a young woman, who in the dawn seemed so
      beautiful, Gomov, appeased and enchanted by the sight of the fairy scene,
      the sea, the mountains, the clouds, the wide sky, thought how at bottom,
      if it were thoroughly explored, everything on earth was beautiful,
      everything, except what we ourselves think and do when we forget the
      higher purposes of life and our own human dignity.
    

      A man came up—a coast-guard—gave a look at them, then went
      away. He, too, seemed mysterious and enchanted. A steamer came over from
      Feodossia, by the light of the morning star, its own lights already put
      out.
    

      "There is dew on the grass," said Anna Sergueyevna after a silence.
    

      "Yes. It is time to go home."
    

      They returned to the town.
    

      Then every afternoon they met on the quay, and lunched together, dined,
      walked, enjoyed the sea. She complained that she slept badly, that her
      heart beat alarmingly. She would ask the same question over and over
      again, and was troubled now by jealousy, now by fear that he did not
      sufficiently respect her. And often in the square or the gardens, when
      there was no one near, he would draw her close and kiss her passionately.
      Their complete idleness, these kisses in the full daylight, given timidly
      and fearfully lest any one should see, the heat, the smell of the sea and
      the continual brilliant parade of leisured, well-dressed, well-fed people
      almost regenerated him. He would tell Anna Sergueyevna how delightful she
      was, how tempting. He was impatiently passionate, never left her side, and
      she would often brood, and even asked him to confess that he did not
      respect her, did not love her at all, and only saw in her a loose woman.
      Almost every evening, rather late, they would drive out of the town, to
      Oreanda, or to the waterfall; and these drives were always delightful, and
      the impressions won during them were always beautiful and sublime.
    

      They expected her husband to come. But he sent a letter in which he said
      that his eyes were bad and implored his wife to come home. Anna
      Sergueyevna began to worry.
    

      "It is a good thing I am going away," she would say to Gomov. "It is
      fate."
    

      She went in a carriage and he accompanied her. They drove for a whole day.
      When she took her seat in the car of an express-train and when the second
      bell sounded, she said:
    

      "Let me have another look at you.... Just one more look. Just as you are."
    

      She did not cry, but was sad and low-spirited, and her lips trembled.
    

      "I will think of you—often," she said. "Good-bye. Good-bye. Don't
      think ill of me. We part for ever. We must, because we ought not to have
      met at all. Now, good-bye."
    

      The train moved off rapidly. Its lights disappeared, and in a minute or
      two the sound of it was lost, as though everything were agreed to put an
      end to this sweet, oblivious madness. Left alone on the platform, looking
      into the darkness, Gomov heard the trilling of the grasshoppers and the
      humming of the telegraph-wires, and felt as though he had just woke up.
      And he thought that it had been one more adventure, one more affair, and
      it also was finished and had left only a memory. He was moved, sad, and
      filled with a faint remorse; surely the young woman, whom he would never
      see again, had not been happy with him; he had been kind to her, friendly,
      and sincere, but still in his attitude toward her, in his tone and
      caresses, there had always been a thin shadow of raillery, the rather
      rough arrogance of the successful male aggravated by the fact that he was
      twice as old as she. And all the time she had called him kind, remarkable,
      noble, so that he was never really himself to her, and had involuntarily
      deceived her....
    

      Here at the station, the smell of autumn was in the air, and the evening
      was cool.
    

      "It is time for me to go North," thought Gomov, as he left the platform.
      "It is time."
    

      III
    

      At home in Moscow, it was already like winter; the stoves were heated, and
      in the mornings, when the children were getting ready to go to school, and
      had their tea, it was dark and their nurse lighted the lamp for a short
      while. The frost had already begun. When the first snow falls, the first
      day of driving in sledges, it is good to see the white earth, the white
      roofs; one breathes easily, eagerly, and then one remembers the days of
      youth. The old lime-trees and birches, white with hoarfrost, have a kindly
      expression; they are nearer to the heart than cypresses and palm-trees,
      and with the dear familiar trees there is no need to think of mountains
      and the sea.
    

      Gomov was a native of Moscow. He returned to Moscow on a fine frosty day,
      and when he donned his fur coat and warm gloves, and took a stroll through
      Petrovka, and when on Saturday evening he heard the church-bells ringing,
      then his recent travels and the places he had visited lost all their
      charm. Little by little he sank back into Moscow life, read eagerly three
      newspapers a day, and said that he did not read Moscow papers as a matter
      of principle. He was drawn into a round of restaurants, clubs,
      dinner-parties, parties, and he was flattered to have his house frequented
      by famous lawyers and actors, and to play cards with a professor at the
      University club. He could eat a whole plateful of hot sielianka.
    

      So a month would pass, and Anna Sergueyevna, he thought, would be lost in
      the mists of memory and only rarely would she visit his dreams with her
      touching smile, just as other women had done. But more than a month
      passed, full winter came, and in his memory everything was clear, as
      though he had parted from Anna Sergueyevna only yesterday. And his memory
      was lit by a light that grew ever stronger. No matter how, through the
      voices of his children saying their lessons, penetrating to the evening
      stillness of his study, through hearing a song, or the music in a
      restaurant, or the snow-storm howling in the chimney, suddenly the whole
      thing would come to life again in his memory: the meeting on the jetty,
      the early morning with the mists on the mountains, the steamer from
      Feodossia and their kisses. He would pace up and down his room and
      remember it all and smile, and then his memories would drift into dreams,
      and the past was confused in his imagination with the future. He did not
      dream at night of Anna Sergueyevna, but she followed him everywhere, like
      a shadow, watching him. As he shut his eyes, he could see her, vividly,
      and she seemed handsomer, tenderer, younger than in reality; and he seemed
      to himself better than he had been at Talta. In the evenings she would
      look at him from the bookcase, from the fireplace, from the corner; he
      could hear her breathing and the soft rustle of her dress. In the street
      he would gaze at women's faces to see if there were not one like her....
    

      He was filled with a great longing to share his memories with some one.
      But at home it was impossible to speak of his love, and away from home—there
      was no one. Impossible to talk of her to the other people in the house and
      the men at the bank. And talk of what? Had he loved then? Was there
      anything fine, romantic, or elevating or even interesting in his relations
      with Anna Sergueyevna? And he would speak vaguely of love, of women, and
      nobody guessed what was the matter, and only his wife would raise her dark
      eyebrows and say:
    

      "Demitri, the rôle of coxcomb does not suit you at all."
    

      One night, as he was coming out of the club with his partner, an official,
      he could not help saying:
    

      "If only I could tell what a fascinating woman I met at Talta."
    

      The official seated himself in his sledge and drove off, but suddenly
      called:
    

      "Dimitri Dimitrich!"
    

      "Yes."
    

      "You were right. The sturgeon was tainted."
    

      These banal words suddenly roused Gomov's indignation. They seemed to him
      degrading and impure. What barbarous customs and people!
    

      What preposterous nights, what dull, empty days! Furious card-playing,
      gourmandising, drinking, endless conversations about the same things,
      futile activities and conversations taking up the best part of the day and
      all the best of a man's forces, leaving only a stunted, wingless life,
      just rubbish; and to go away and escape was impossible—one might as
      well be in a lunatic asylum or in prison with hard labour.
    

      Gomov did not sleep that night, but lay burning with indignation, and then
      all next day he had a headache. And the following night he slept badly,
      sitting up in bed and thinking, or pacing from corner to corner of his
      room. His children bored him, the bank bored him, and he had no desire to
      go out or to speak to any one.
    

      In December when the holidays came he prepared to go on a journey and told
      his wife he was going to Petersburg to present a petition for a young
      friend of his—and went to S. Why? He did not know. He wanted to see
      Anna Sergueyevna, to talk to her, and if possible to arrange an
      assignation.
    

      He arrived at S. in the morning and occupied the best room in the hotel,
      where the whole floor was covered with a grey canvas, and on the table
      there stood an inkstand grey with dust, adorned with a horseman on a
      headless horse holding a net in his raised hand. The porter gave him the
      necessary information: von Didenitz; Old Goucharno Street, his own house—not
      far from the hotel; lives well, has his own horses, every one knows him.
    

      Gomov walked slowly to Old Goucharno Street and found the house. In front
      of it was a long, grey fence spiked with nails.
    

      "No getting over a fence like that," thought Gomov, glancing from the
      windows to the fence.
    

      He thought: "To-day is a holiday and her husband is probably at home.
      Besides it would be tactless to call and upset her. If he sent a note then
      it might fall into her husband's hands and spoil everything. It would be
      better to wait for an opportunity." And he kept on walking up and down the
      street, and round the fence, waiting for his opportunity. He saw a beggar
      go in at the gate and the dogs attack him. He heard a piano and the sounds
      came faintly to his ears. It must be Anna Sergueyevna playing. The door
      suddenly opened and out of it came an old woman, and after her ran the
      familiar white Pomeranian. Gomov wanted to call the dog, but his heart
      suddenly began to thump and in his agitation he could not remember the
      dog's name.
    

      He walked on, and more and more he hated the grey fence and thought with a
      gust of irritation that Anna Sergueyevna had already forgotten him, and
      was perhaps already amusing herself with some one else, as would be only
      natural in a young woman forced from morning to night to behold the
      accursed fence. He returned to his room and sat for a long time on the
      sofa, not knowing what to do. Then he dined and afterward slept for a long
      while.
    

      "How idiotic and tiresome it all is," he thought as he awoke and saw the
      dark windows; for it was evening. "I've had sleep enough, and what shall I
      do to-night?"
    

      He sat on his bed which was covered with a cheap, grey blanket, exactly
      like those used in a hospital, and tormented himself.
    

      "So much for the lady with the toy dog.... So much for the great
      adventure.... Here you sit."
    

      However, in the morning, at the station, his eye had been caught by a
      poster with large letters: "First Performance of 'The Geisha.'" He
      remembered that and went to the theatre.
    

      "It is quite possible she will go to the first performance," he thought.
    

      The theatre was full and, as usual in all provincial theatres, there was a
      thick mist above the lights, the gallery was noisily restless; in the
      first row before the opening of the performance stood the local dandies
      with their hands behind their backs, and there in the governor's box, in
      front, sat the governor's daughter, and the governor himself sat modestly
      behind the curtain and only his hands were visible. The curtain quivered;
      the orchestra tuned up for a long time, and while the audience were coming
      in and taking their seats, Gomov gazed eagerly round.
    

      At last Anna Sergueyevna came in. She took her seat in the third row, and
      when Gomov glanced at her his heart ached and he knew that for him there
      was no one in the whole world nearer, dearer, and more important than she;
      she was lost in this provincial rabble, the little undistinguished woman,
      with a common lorgnette in her hands, yet she filled his whole life; she
      was his grief, his joy, his only happiness, and he longed for her; and
      through the noise of the bad orchestra with its tenth-rate fiddles, he
      thought how dear she was to him. He thought and dreamed.
    

      With Anna Sergueyevna there came in a young man with short side-whiskers,
      very tall, stooping; with every movement he shook and bowed continually.
      Probably he was the husband whom in a bitter mood at Talta she had called
      a lackey. And, indeed, in his long figure, his side-whiskers, the little
      bald patch on the top of his head, there was something of the lackey; he
      had a modest sugary smile and in his buttonhole he wore a University badge
      exactly like a lackey's number.
    

      In the first entr'acte the husband went out to smoke, and she was left
      alone. Gomov, who was also in the pit, came up to her and said in a
      trembling voice with a forced smile:
    

      "How do you do?"
    

      She looked up at him and went pale. Then she glanced at him again in
      terror, not believing her eyes, clasped her fan and lorgnette tightly
      together, apparently struggling to keep herself from fainting. Both were
      silent. She sat, he stood; frightened by her emotion, not daring to sit
      down beside her. The fiddles and flutes began to play and suddenly it
      seemed to them as though all the people in the boxes were looking at them.
      She got up and walked quickly to the exit; he followed, and both walked
      absently along the corridors, down the stairs, up the stairs, with the
      crowd shifting and shimmering before their eyes; all kinds of uniforms,
      judges, teachers, crown-estates, and all with badges; ladies shone and
      shimmered before them, like fur coats on moving rows of clothes-pegs, and
      there was a draught howling through the place laden with the smell of
      tobacco and cigar-ends. And Gomov, whose heart was thudding wildly,
      thought:
    

      "Oh, Lord! Why all these men and that beastly orchestra?"
    

      At that very moment he remembered how when he had seen Anna Sergueyevna
      off that evening at the station he had said to himself that everything was
      over between them, and they would never meet again. And now how far off
      they were from the end!
    

      On a narrow, dark staircase over which was written: "This Way to the
      Amphitheatre," she stopped:
    

      "How you frightened me!" she said, breathing heavily, still pale and
      apparently stupefied. "Oh! how you frightened me! I am nearly dead. Why
      did you come? Why?"
    

      "Understand me, Anna," he whispered quickly. "I implore you to
      understand...."
    

      She looked at him fearfully, in entreaty, with love in her eyes, gazing
      fixedly to gather up in her memory every one of his features.
    

      "I suffer so!" she went on, not listening to him. "All the time, I thought
      only of you. I lived with thoughts of you.... And I wanted to forget, to
      forget, but why, why did you come?"
    

      A little above them, on the landing, two schoolboys stood and smoked and
      looked down at them, but Gomov did not care. He drew her to him and began
      to kiss her cheeks, her hands.
    

      "What are you doing? What are you doing?" she said in terror, thrusting
      him away.... "We were both mad. Go away to-night. You must go away at
      once.... I implore you, by everything you hold sacred, I implore you....
      The people are coming——-"
    

      Some one passed them on the stairs.
    

      "You must go away," Anna Sergueyevna went on in a whisper. "Do you hear,
      Dimitri Dimitrich? I'll come to you in Moscow. I never was happy. Now I am
      unhappy and I shall never, never be happy, never! Don't make me suffer
      even more! I swear, I'll come to Moscow. And now let us part. My dear,
      dearest darling, let us part!"
    

      She pressed his hand and began to go quickly down-stairs, all the while
      looking back at him, and in her eyes plainly showed that she was most
      unhappy. Gomov stood for a while, listened, then, when all was quiet he
      found his coat and left the theatre.
    

      IV
    

      And Anna Sergueyevna began to come to him in Moscow. Once every two or
      three months she would leave S., telling her husband that she was going to
      consult a specialist in women's diseases. Her husband half believed and
      half disbelieved her. At Moscow she would stay at the "Slaviansky Bazaar"
      and send a message at once to Gomov. He would come to her, and nobody in
      Moscow knew.
    

      Once as he was going to her as usual one winter morning—he had not
      received her message the night before—he had his daughter with him,
      for he was taking her to school which was on the way. Great wet flakes of
      snow were falling.
    

      "Three degrees above freezing," he said, "and still the snow is falling.
      But the warmth is only on the surface of the earth. In the upper strata of
      the atmosphere there is quite a different temperature."
    

      "Yes, papa. Why is there no thunder in winter?"
    

      He explained this too, and as he spoke he thought of his assignation, and
      that not a living soul knew of it, or ever would know. He had two lives;
      one obvious, which every one could see and know, if they were sufficiently
      interested, a life full of conventional truth and conventional fraud,
      exactly like the lives of his friends and acquaintances; and another,
      which moved underground. And by a strange conspiracy of circumstances,
      everything that was to him important, interesting, vital, everything that
      enabled him to be sincere and denied self-deception and was the very core
      of his being, must dwell hidden away from others, and everything that made
      him false, a mere shape in which he hid himself in order to conceal the
      truth, as for instance his work in the bank, arguments at the club, his
      favourite gibe about women, going to parties with his wife—all this
      was open. And, judging others by himself, he did not believe the things he
      saw, and assumed that everybody else also had his real vital life passing
      under a veil of mystery as under the cover of the night. Every man's
      intimate existence is kept mysterious, and perhaps, in part, because of
      that civilised people are so nervously anxious that a personal secret
      should be respected.
    

      When he had left his daughter at school, Gomov went to the "Slaviansky
      Bazaar." He took off his fur coat down-stairs, went up and knocked quietly
      at the door. Anna Sergueyevna, wearing his favourite grey dress, tired by
      the journey, had been expecting him to come all night. She was pale, and
      looked at him without a smile, and flung herself on his breast as soon as
      he entered. Their kiss was long and lingering as though they had not seen
      each other for a couple of years.
    

      "Well, how are you getting on down there?" he asked. "What is your news?"
    

      "Wait. I'll tell you presently.... I cannot."
    

      She could not speak, for she was weeping. She turned her face from him and
      dried her eyes.
    

      "Well, let her cry a bit.... I'll wait," he thought, and sat down.
    

      Then he rang and ordered tea, and then, as he drank it, she stood and
      gazed out of the window.... She was weeping in distress, in the bitter
      knowledge that their life had fallen out so sadly; only seeing each other
      in secret, hiding themselves away like thieves! Was not their life
      crushed?
    

      "Don't cry.... Don't cry," he said.
    

      It was clear to him that their love was yet far from its end, which there
      was no seeing. Anna Sergueyevna was more and more passionately attached to
      him; she adored him and it was inconceivable that he should tell her that
      their love must some day end; she would not believe it.
    

      He came up to her and patted her shoulder fondly and at that moment he saw
      himself in the mirror.
    

      His hair was already going grey. And it seemed strange to him that in the
      last few years he should have got so old and ugly. Her shoulders were warm
      and trembled to his touch. He was suddenly filled with pity for her life,
      still so warm and beautiful, but probably beginning to fade and wither,
      like his own. Why should she love him so much? He always seemed to women
      not what he really was, and they loved in him, not himself, but the
      creature of their imagination, the thing they hankered for in life, and
      when they had discovered their mistake, still they loved him. And not one
      of them was happy with him. Time passed; he met women and was friends with
      them, went further and parted, but never once did he love; there was
      everything but love.
    

      And now at last when his hair was grey he had fallen in love, real love—for
      the first time in his life.
    

      Anna Sergueyevna and he loved one another, like dear kindred, like husband
      and wife, like devoted friends; it seemed to them that Fate had destined
      them for one another, and it was inconceivable that he should have a wife,
      she a husband; they were like two birds of passage, a male and a female,
      which had been caught and forced to live in separate cages. They had
      forgiven each other all the past of which they were ashamed; they forgave
      everything in the present, and they felt that their love had changed both
      of them.
    

      Formerly, when he felt a melancholy compunction, he used to comfort
      himself with all kinds of arguments, just as they happened to cross his
      mind, but now he was far removed from any such ideas; he was filled with a
      profound pity, and he desired to be tender and sincere....
    

      "Don't cry, my darling," he said. "You have cried enough.... Now let us
      talk and see if we can't find some way out."
    

      Then they talked it all over, and tried to discover some means of avoiding
      the necessity for concealment and deception, and the torment of living in
      different towns, and of not seeing each other for a long time. How could
      they shake off these intolerable fetters?
    

      "How? How?" he asked, holding his head in his hands. "How?"
    

      And it seemed that but a little while and the solution would be found and
      there would begin a lovely new life; and to both of them it was clear that
      the end was still very far off, and that their hardest and most difficult
      period was only just beginning.
    

GOUSSIEV
    

IT was already dark and would soon be night.
    

      Goussiev, a private on long leave, raised himself a little in his hammock
      and said in a whisper:
    

      "Can you hear me, Pavel Ivanich? A soldier at Souchan told me that their
      boat ran into an enormous fish and knocked a hole in her bottom."
    

      The man of condition unknown whom he addressed, and whom everybody in the
      hospital-ship called Pavel Ivanich, was silent, as if he had not heard.
    

      And once more there was silence.... The wind whistled through the rigging,
      the screw buzzed, the waves came washing, the hammocks squeaked, but to
      all these sounds their ears were long since accustomed and it seemed as
      though everything were wrapped in sleep and silence. It was very
      oppressive. The three patients—two soldiers and a sailor—who
      had played cards all day were now asleep and tossing to and fro.
    

      The vessel began to shake. The hammock under Goussiev slowly heaved up and
      down, as though it were breathing—one, two, three.... Something
      crashed on the floor and began to tinkle: the jug must have fallen down.
    

      "The wind has broken loose...." said Goussiev, listening attentively.
    

      This time Pavel Ivanich coughed and answered irritably:
    

      "You spoke just now of a ship colliding with a large fish, and now you
      talk of the wind breaking loose.... Is the wind a dog to break loose?"
    

      "That's what people say."
    

      "Then people are as ignorant as you.... But what do they not say? You
      should keep a head on your shoulders and think. Silly idiot!"
    

      Pavel Ivanich was subject to seasickness. When the ship rolled he would
      get very cross, and the least trifle would upset him, though Goussiev
      could never see anything to be cross about. What was there unusual in his
      story about the fish or in his saying that the wind had broken loose?
      Suppose the fish were as big as a mountain and its back were as hard as a
      sturgeon's, and suppose that at the end of the wood there were huge stone
      walls with the snarling winds chained up to them.... If they do not break
      loose, why then do they rage over the sea as though they were possessed,
      and rush about like dogs? If they are not chained, what happens to them
      when it is calm?
    

      Goussiev thought for a long time of a fish as big as a mountain, and of
      thick rusty chains; then he got tired of that and began to think of his
      native place whither he was returning after five years' service in the Far
      East. He saw with his mind's eye the great pond covered with snow.... On
      one side of the pond was a brick-built pottery, with a tall chimney
      belching clouds of black smoke, and on the other side was the village....
      From the yard of the fifth house from the corner came his brother Alency
      in a sledge; behind him sat his little son Vanka in large felt boots, and
      his daughter Akulka, also in felt boots. Alency is tipsy, Vanka laughs,
      and Akulka's face is hidden—she is well wrapped up.
    

      "The children will catch cold ..." thought Goussiev. "God grant them," he
      whispered, "a pure right mind that they may honour their parents and be
      better than their father and mother...."
    

      "The boots want soling," cried the sick sailor in a deep voice. "Aye,
      aye."
    

      The thread of Goussiev's thoughts was broken, and instead of the pond,
      suddenly—without rhyme or reason—he saw a large bull's head
      without eyes, and the horse and sledge did not move on, but went round and
      round in a black mist. But still he was glad he had seen his dear ones. He
      gasped for joy, and his limbs tingled and his fingers throbbed.
    

      "God suffered me to see them!" he muttered, and opened his eyes and looked
      round in the darkness for water.
    

      He drank, then lay down again, and once more the sledge skimmed along, and
      he saw the bull's head without eyes, black smoke, clouds of it. And so on
      till dawn.
    

      II
    

      At first through the darkness there appeared only a blue circle, the
      port-hole, then Goussiev began slowly to distinguish the man in the next
      hammock, Pavel Ivanich. He was sleeping in a sitting position, for if he
      lay down he could not breathe. His face was grey; his nose long and sharp,
      and his eyes were huge, because he was so thin; his temples were sunk, his
      beard scanty, the hair on his head long.... By his face it was impossible
      to tell his class: gentleman, merchant, or peasant; judging by his
      appearance and long hair he looked almost like a recluse, a lay-brother,
      but when he spoke—he was not at all like a monk. He was losing
      strength through his cough and his illness and the suffocating heat, and
      he breathed heavily and was always moving his dry lips. Noticing that
      Goussiev was looking at him, he turned toward him and said:
    

      "I'm beginning to understand.... Yes.... Now I understand."
    

      "What do you understand, Pavel Ivanich?"
    

      "Yes.... It was strange to me at first, why you sick men, instead of being
      kept quiet, should be on this steamer, where the heat is stifling, and
      stinking, and pitching and tossing, and must be fatal to you; but now it
      is all clear to me.... Yes. The doctors sent you to the steamer to get rid
      of you. They got tired of all the trouble you gave them, brutes like you.
    

      ...You don't pay them; you only give a lot of trouble, and if you die you
      spoil their reports. Therefore you are just cattle, and there is no
      difficulty in getting rid of you.... They only need to lack conscience and
      humanity, and to deceive the owners of the steamer. We needn't worry about
      the first, they are experts by nature; but the second needs a certain
      amount of practice. In a crowd of four hundred healthy soldiers and
      sailors—five sick men are never noticed; so you were carried up to
      the steamer, mixed with a healthy lot who were counted in such a hurry
      that nothing wrong was noticed, and when the steamer got away they saw
      fever-stricken and consumptive men lying helpless on the deck...."
    

      Goussiev could not make out what Pavel Ivanich was talking about; thinking
      he was being taken to task, he said by way of excusing himself:
    

      "I lay on the deck because when we were taken off the barge I caught a
      chill."
    

      "Shocking!" said Pavel Ivanich. "They know quite well that you can't last
      out the voyage, and yet they send you here! You may get as far as the
      Indian Ocean, but what then? It is awful to think of.... And that's all
      the return you get for faithful unblemished service!"
    

      Pavel Ivanich looked very angry, and smote his forehead and gasped:
    

      "They ought to be shown up in the papers. There would be an awful row."
    

      The two sick soldiers and the sailor were already up and had begun to play
      cards, the sailor propped up in his hammock, and the soldiers squatting
      uncomfortably on the floor. One soldier had his right arm in a sling and
      his wrist was tightly bandaged so that he had to hold the cards in his
      left hand or in the crook of his elbow. The boat was rolling violently so
      that it was impossible to get up or to drink tea or to take medicine.
    

      "You were an orderly?" Pavel Ivanich asked Goussiev.
    

      "That's it. An orderly."
    

      "My God, my God!" said Pavel Ivanich sorrowfully. "To take a man from his
      native place, drag him fifteen thousand miles, drive him into consumption
      ... and what for? I ask you. To make him an orderly to some Captain
      Farthing or Midshipman Hole! Where's the sense of it?"
    

      "It's not a bad job, Pavel Ivanich. You get up in the morning, clean the
      boots, boil the samovar, tidy up the room, and then there is nothing to
      do. The lieutenant draws plans all day long, and you can pray to God if
      you like—or read books—or go out into the streets. It's a good
      enough life."
    

      "Yes. Very good! The lieutenant draws plans, and you stay in the kitchen
      all day long and suffer from homesickness.... Plans.... Plans don't
      matter. It's human life that matters! Life doesn't come again. One should
      be sparing of it."
    

      "Certainly Pavel Ivanich. A bad man meets no quarter, either at home, or
      in the army, but if you live straight, and do as you are told, then no one
      will harm you. They are educated and they understand.... For five years
      now I've never been in the cells and I've only been thrashed once—touch
      wood!"
    

      "What was that for?"
    

      "Fighting. I have a heavy fist, Pavel Ivanich. Four Chinamen came into our
      yard: they were carrying wood, I think, but I don't remember. Well, I was
      bored. I went for them and one of them got a bloody nose. The lieutenant
      saw it through the window and gave me a thick ear."
    

      "You poor fool," muttered Pavel Ivanich. "You don't understand anything."
    

      He was completely exhausted with the tossing of the boat and shut his
      eyes; his head fell back and then flopped forward onto his chest. He tried
      several times to lie down, but in vain, for he could not breathe.
    

      "And why did you go for the four Chinamen?" he asked after a while.
    

      "For no reason. They came into the yard and I went for them."
    

      Silence fell.... The gamblers played for a couple of hours, absorbed and
      cursing, but the tossing of the ship tired even them; they threw the cards
      away and laid down. Once more Goussiev thought of the big pond, the
      pottery, the village. Once more the sledges skimmed along, once more Vanka
      laughed, and that fool of an Akulka opened her fur coat, and stretched out
      her feet; look, she seemed to say, look, poor people, my felt boots are
      new and not like Vanka's.
    

      "She's getting on for six and still she has no sense!" said Goussiev.
      "Instead of showing your boots off, why don't you bring some water to your
      soldier-uncle? I'll give you a present."
    

      Then came Andrea, with his firelock on his shoulder, carrying a hare he
      had shot, and he was followed by Tsaichik the cripple, who offered him a
      piece of soap for the hare; and there was the black heifer in the yard,
      and Domna sewing a shirt and crying over something, and there was the
      eyeless bull's head and the black smoke....
    

      Overhead there was shouting, sailors running; the sound of something heavy
      being dragged along the deck, or something had broken.... More running.
      Something wrong? Goussiev raised his head, listened and saw the two
      soldiers and the sailor playing cards again; Pavel Ivanich sitting up and
      moving his lips. It was very close, he could hardly breathe, he wanted a
      drink, but the water was warm and disgusting.... The pitching of the boat
      was now better.
    

      Suddenly something queer happened to one of the soldiers.... He called ace
      of diamonds, lost his reckoning and dropped his cards. He started and
      laughed stupidly and looked round.
    

      "In a moment, you fellows," he said and lay down on the floor.
    

      All were at a loss. They shouted at him but he made no reply.
    

      "Stiepan, are you ill?" asked the other soldier with the bandaged hand.
      "Perhaps we'd better call the priest, eh?"
    

      "Stiepan, drink some water," said the sailor. "Here, mate, have a drink."
    

      "What's the good of breaking his teeth with the jug," shouted Goussiev
      angrily. "Don't you see, you fatheads?"
    

      "What."
    

      "What!" cried Goussiev. "He's snuffed it, dead. That's what! Good God,
      what fools!..."
    

      III
    

      The rolling stopped and Pavel Ivanich cheered up. He was no longer
      peevish. His face had an arrogant, impetuous, and mocking expression. He
      looked as if he were on the point of saying: "I'll tell you a story that
      will make you die of laughter." Their port-hole was open and a soft wind
      blew in on Pavel Ivanich. Voices could be heard and the splash of oars in
      the water.... Beneath the window some one was howling in a thin, horrible
      voice; probably a Chinaman singing.
    

      "Yes. We are in harbour," said Pavel Ivanich, smiling mockingly. "Another
      month and we shall be in Russia. It's true; my gallant warriors, I shall
      get to Odessa and thence I shall go straight to Kharkhov. At Kharkhov I
      have a friend, a literary man. I shall go to him and I shall say, 'now, my
      friend, give up your rotten little love-stories and descriptions of
      nature, and expose the vileness of the human biped.... There's a subject
      for you.'"
    

      He thought for a moment and then he said:
    

      "Goussiev, do you know how I swindled them?"
    

      "Who, Pavel Ivanich?"
    

      "The lot out there.... You see there's only first and third class on the
      steamer, and only peasants are allowed to go third. If you have a decent
      suit, and look like a nobleman or a bourgeois, at a distance, then you
      must go first. It may break you, but you have to lay down your five
      hundred roubles. 'What's the point of such an arrangement?' I asked. 'Is
      it meant to raise the prestige of Russian intellectuals?' 'Not a bit,'
      said they. 'We don't let you go, simply because it is impossible for a
      decent man to go third. It is so vile and disgusting.' 'Yes,' said I.
      'Thanks for taking so much trouble about decent people. Anyhow, bad or no,
      I haven't got five hundred roubles as I have neither robbed the treasury
      nor exploited foreigners, nor dealt in contraband, nor flogged any one to
      death, and, therefore, I think I have a right to go first-class and to
      take rank with the intelligentsia of Russia.' But there's no convincing
      them by logic.... I had to try fraud. I put on a peasant's coat and long
      boots, and a drunken, stupid expression and went to the agent and said:
      'Give me a ticket, your Honour.'
    

      "'What's your position?' says the agent.
    

      "'Clerical,' said I. 'My father was an honest priest. He always told the
      truth to the great ones of the earth, and so he suffered much.'"
    

      Pavel Ivanich got tired with talking, and his breath failed him, but he
      went on:
    

      "Yes. I always tell the truth straight out.... I am afraid of nobody and
      nothing. There's a great difference between myself and you in that
      respect. You are dull, blind, stupid, you see nothing, and you don't
      understand what you do see. You are told that the wind breaks its chain,
      that you are brutes and worse, and you believe; you are thrashed and you
      kiss the hand that thrashes you; a swine in a raccoon pelisse robs you,
      and throws you sixpence for tea, and you say: 'Please, your Honour, let me
      kiss your hand.' You are pariahs, skunks.... I am different. I live
      consciously. I see everything, as an eagle or a hawk sees when it hovers
      over the earth, and I understand everything. I am a living protest. I see
      injustice—I protest; I see bigotry and hypocrisy—I protest; I
      see swine triumphant—I protest, and I am unconquerable. No Spanish
      inquisition can make me hold my tongue. Aye.... Cut my tongue out. I'll
      protest by gesture.... Shut me up in a dungeon—I'll shout so loud
      that I shall be heard for a mile round, or I'll starve myself, so that
      there shall be a still heavier weight on their black consciences. Kill me—and
      my ghost will return. All my acquaintances tell me: 'You are a most
      insufferable man, Pavel Ivanich!' I am proud of such a reputation. I
      served three years in the Far East, and have got bitter memories enough
      for a hundred years. I inveighed against it all. My friends write from
      Russia: 'Do not come.' But I'm going, to spite them.... Yes.... That is
      life. I understand. You can call that life."
    

      Goussiev was not listening, but lay looking out of the port-hole; on the
      transparent lovely turquoise water swung a boat all shining in the
      shimmering light; a fat Chinaman was sitting in it eating rice with
      chop-sticks. The water murmured softly, and over it lazily soared white
      sea-gulls.
    

      "It would be fun to give that fat fellow one on the back of his neck...."
      thought Goussiev, watching the fat Chinaman and yawning.
    

      He dozed, and it seemed to him that all the world was slumbering. Time
      slipped swiftly away. The day passed imperceptibly; imperceptibly the
      twilight fell.... The steamer was still no longer but was moving on.
    

      IV
    

      Two days passed. Pavel Ivanich no longer sat up, but lay full length; his
      eyes were closed and his nose seemed to be sharper than ever.
    

      "Pavel Ivanich!" called Goussiev, "Pavel Ivanich."
    

      Pavel Ivanich opened his eyes and moved his lips.
    

      "Aren't you well?"
    

      "It's nothing," answered Pavel Ivanich, breathing heavily. "It's nothing.
      No. I'm much better. You see I can lie down now. I'm much better."
    

      "Thank God for it, Pavel Ivanich."
    

      "When I compare myself with you, I am sorry for you ... poor devils. My
      lungs are all right; my cough comes from indigestion ... I can endure this
      hell, not to mention the Red Sea! Besides, I have a critical attitude
      toward my illness, as well as to my medicine. But you ... you are
      ignorant.... It's hard lines on you, very hard."
    

      The ship was running smoothly; it was calm but still stifling and hot as a
      Turkish bath; it was hard not only to speak but even to listen without an
      effort. Goussiev clasped his knees, leaned his head on them and thought of
      his native place. My God, in such heat it was a pleasure to think of snow
      and cold! He saw himself driving on a sledge, and suddenly the horses were
      frightened and bolted.... Heedless of roads, dikes, ditches they rushed
      like mad through the village, across the pond, past the works, through the
      fields.... "Hold them in!" cried the women and the passers-by. "Hold them
      in!" But why hold them in? Let the cold wind slap your face and cut your
      hands; let the lumps of snow thrown up by the horses' hoofs fall on your
      hat, down your neck and chest; let the runners of the sledge be buckled,
      and the traces and harness be torn and be damned to it! What fun when the
      sledge topples over and you are flung hard into a snow-drift; with your
      face slap into the snow, and you get up all white with your moustaches
      covered with icicles, hatless, gloveless, with your belt undone.... People
      laugh and dogs bark....
    

      Pavel Ivanich, with one eye half open looked at Goussiev and asked
      quietly:
    

      "Goussiev, did your commander steal?"
    

      "How do I know, Pavel Ivanich? The likes of us don't hear of it."
    

      A long time passed in silence. Goussiev thought, dreamed, drank water; it
      was difficult to speak, difficult to hear, and he was afraid of being
      spoken to. One hour passed, a second, a third; evening came, then night;
      but he noticed nothing as he sat dreaming of the snow.
    

      He could hear some one coming into the ward; voices, but five minutes
      passed and all was still.
    

      "God rest his soul!" said the soldier with the bandaged hand. "He was a
      restless man."
    

      "What?" asked Goussiev. "Who?"
    

      "He's dead. He has just been taken up-stairs."
    

      "Oh, well," muttered Goussiev with a yawn. "God rest his soul."
    

      "What do you think, Goussiev?" asked the bandaged soldier after some time.
      "Will he go to heaven?"
    

      "Who?"
    

      "Pavel Ivanich."
    

      "He will. He suffered much. Besides, he was a priest's son, and priests
      have many relations. They will pray for his soul."
    

      The bandaged soldier sat down on Goussiev's hammock and said in an
      undertone:
    

      "You won't live much longer, Goussiev. You'll never see Russia."
    

      "Did the doctor or the nurse tell you that?" asked Goussiev.
    

      "No one told me, but I can see it. You can always tell when a man is going
      to die soon. You neither eat nor drink, and you have gone very thin and
      awful to look at. Consumption. That's what it is. I'm not saying this to
      make you uneasy, but because I thought you might like to have the last
      sacrament. And if you have any money, you had better give it to the senior
      officer."
    

      "I have not written home," said Goussiev. "I shall die and they will never
      know."
    

      "They will know," said the sailor in his deep voice. "When you die they
      will put you down in the log, and at Odessa they will give a note to the
      military governor, and he will send it to your parish or wherever it
      is...."
    

      This conversation made Goussiev begin to feel unhappy and a vague desire
      began to take possession of him. He drank water—it was not that; he
      stretched out to the port-hole and breathed the hot, moist air—it
      was not that; he tried to think of his native place and the snow—it
      was not that.... At last he felt that he would choke if he stayed a moment
      longer in the hospital.
    

      "I feel poorly, mates," he said. "I want to go on deck. For Christ's sake
      take me on deck."
    

      Goussiev flung his arms round the soldier's neck and the soldier held him
      with his free arm and supported him up the gangway. On deck there were
      rows and rows of sleeping soldiers and sailors; so many of them that it
      was difficult to pick a way through them.
    

      "Stand up," said the bandaged soldier gently. "Walk after me slowly and
      hold on to my shirt...."
    

      It was dark. There was no light on deck or on the masts or over the sea.
      In the bows a sentry stood motionless as a statue, but he looked as if he
      were asleep. It was as though the steamer had been left to its own sweet
      will, to go where it liked.
    

      "They are going to throw Pavel Ivanich into the sea," said the bandaged
      soldier. "They will put him in a sack and throw him overboard."
    

      "Yes. That's the way they do."
    

      "But it's better to lie at home in the earth. Then the mother can go to
      the grave and weep over it."
    

      "Surely."
    

      There was a smell of dung and hay. With heads hanging there were oxen
      standing by the bulwark—one, two, three ... eight beasts. And there
      was a little horse. Goussiev put out his hand to pat it, but it shook its
      head, showed its teeth and tried to bite his sleeve.
    

      "Damn you," said Goussiev angrily.
    

      He and the soldier slowly made their way to the bows and stood against the
      bulwark and looked silently up and down. Above them was the wide sky,
      bright with stars, peace and tranquillity—exactly as it was at home
      in his village; but below—darkness and turbulence. Mysterious
      towering waves. Each wave seemed to strive to rise higher than the rest;
      and they pressed and jostled each other and yet others came, fierce and
      ugly, and hurled themselves into the fray.
    

      There is neither sense nor pity in the sea. Had the steamer been smaller,
      and not made of tough iron, the waves would have crushed it remorselessly
      and all the men in it, without distinction of good and bad. The steamer
      too seemed cruel and senseless. The large-nosed monster pressed forward
      and cut its way through millions of waves; it was afraid neither of
      darkness, nor of the wind, nor of space, nor of loneliness; it cared for
      nothing, and if the ocean had its people, the monster would crush them
      without distinction of good and bad.
    

      "Where are we now?" asked Goussiev.
    

      "I don't know. Must be the ocean."
    

      "There's no land in sight."
    

      "Why, they say we shan't see land for another seven days."
    

      The two soldiers looked at the white foam gleaming with phosphorescence.
      Goussiev was the first to break the silence.
    

      "Nothing is really horrible," he said. "You feel uneasy, as if you were in
      a dark forest. Suppose a boat were lowered and I was ordered to go a
      hundred miles out to sea to fish—I would go. Or suppose I saw a soul
      fall into the water—I would go in after him. I wouldn't go in for a
      German or a Chinaman, but I'd try to save a Russian."
    

      "Aren't you afraid to die?"
    

      "Yes. I'm afraid. I'm sorry for the people at home. I have a brother at
      home, you know, and he is not steady; he drinks, beats his wife for
      nothing at all, and my old father and mother may be brought to ruin. But
      my legs are giving way, mate, and it is hot here.... Let me go to bed."
    

      V
    

      Goussiev went back to the ward and lay down in his hammock. As before, a
      vague desire tormented him and he could not make out what it was. There
      was a congestion in his chest; a noise in his head, and his mouth was so
      dry that he could hardly move his tongue. He dozed and dreamed, and,
      exhausted by the heat, his cough and the nightmares that haunted him,
      toward morning he fell into a deep sleep. He dreamed he was in barracks,
      and the bread had just been taken out of the oven, and he crawled into the
      oven and lathered himself with a birch broom. He slept for two days and on
      the third day in the afternoon two sailors came down and carried him out
      of the ward.
    

      He was sewn up in sail-cloth, and to make him heavier two iron bars were
      sewn up with him. In the sail-cloth he looked like a carrot or a radish,
      broad at the top, narrow at the bottom.... Just before sunset he was taken
      on deck and laid on a board one end of which lay on the bulwark, the other
      on a box, raised up by a stool. Round him stood the invalided soldiers.
    

      "Blessed is our God," began the priest; "always, now and for ever and
      ever."
    

      "Amen!" said three sailors.
    

      The soldiers and the crew crossed themselves and looked askance at the
      waves. It was strange that a man should be sewn up in sail-cloth and
      dropped into the sea. Could it happen to any one?
    

      The priest sprinkled Goussiev with earth and bowed. A hymn was sung.
    

      The guard lifted up the end of the board, Goussiev slipped down it; shot
      headlong, turned over in the air, then plop! The foam covered him, for a
      moment it looked as though he was swathed in lace, but the moment passed—and
      he disappeared beneath the waves.
    

      He dropped down to the bottom. Would he reach it? The bottom is miles
      down, they say. He dropped down almost sixty or seventy feet, then began
      to go slower and slower, swung to and fro as though he were thinking;
      then, borne along by the current; he moved more sideways than downward.
    

      But soon he met a shoal of pilot-fish. Seeing a dark body, the fish
      stopped dead and sudden, all together, turned and went back. Less than a
      minute later, like arrows they darted at Goussiev, zigzagging through the
      water around him....
    

      Later came another dark body, a shark. Gravely and leisurely, as though it
      had not noticed Goussiev, it swam up under him, and he rolled over on its
      back; it turned its belly up, taking its ease in the warm, translucent
      water, and slowly opened its mouth with its two rows of teeth. The
      pilot-fish were wildly excited; they stopped to see what was going to
      happen. The shark played with the body, then slowly opened its mouth under
      it, touched it with its teeth, and the sail-cloth was ripped open from
      head to foot; one of the bars fell out, frightening the pilot-fish and
      striking the shark on its side, and sank to the bottom.
    

      And above the surface, the clouds were huddling up about the setting sun;
      one cloud was like a triumphal arch, another like a lion, another like a
      pair of scissors.... From behind the clouds came a broad green ray
      reaching up to the very middle of the sky; a little later a violet ray was
      flung alongside this, and then others gold and pink.... The sky was soft
      and lilac, pale and tender. At first beneath the lovely, glorious sky the
      ocean frowned, but soon the ocean also took on colour—sweet, joyful,
      passionate colours, almost impossible to name in human language.
    

MY LIFE
    

      THE STORY OF A PROVINCIAL
    

THE director said to me: "I only keep you out of
      respect for your worthy father, or you would have gone long since." I
      replied: "You flatter me, your Excellency, but I suppose I am in a
      position to go." And then I heard him saying: "Take the fellow away, he is
      getting on my nerves."
    

      Two days later I was dismissed. Ever since I had been grown up, to the
      great sorrow of my father, the municipal architect, I had changed my
      position nine times, going from one department to another, but all the
      departments were as like each other as drops of water; I had to sit and
      write, listen to inane and rude remarks, and just wait until I was
      dismissed.
    

      When I told my father, he was sitting back in his chair with his eyes
      shut. His thin, dry face, with a dove-coloured tinge where he shaved (his
      face was like that of an old Catholic organist), wore an expression of
      meek submission. Without answering my greeting or opening his eyes, he
      said:
    

      "If my dear wife, your mother, were alive, your life would be a constant
      grief to her. I can see the hand of Providence in her untimely death. Tell
      me, you unhappy boy," he went on, opening his eyes, "what am I to do with
      you?"
    

      When I was younger my relations and friends knew what to do with me; some
      advised me to go into the army as a volunteer, others were for pharmacy,
      others for the telegraph service; but now that I was twenty-four and was
      going grey at the temples and had already tried the army and pharmacy and
      the telegraph service, and every possibility seemed to be exhausted, they
      gave me no more advice, but only sighed and shook their heads.
    

      "What do you think of yourself?" my father went on. "At your age other
      young men have a good social position, and just look at yourself: a lazy
      lout, a beggar, living on your father!"
    

      And, as usual, he went on to say that young men were going to the dogs
      through want of faith, materialism, and conceit, and that amateur
      theatricals should be prohibited because they seduce young people from
      religion and their duty.
    

      "To-morrow we will go together, and you shall apologise to the director
      and promise to do your work conscientiously," he concluded. "You must not
      be without a position in society for a single day."
    

      "Please listen to me," said I firmly, though I did not anticipate gaining
      anything by speaking. "What you call a position in society is the
      privilege of capital and education. But people who are poor and uneducated
      have to earn their living by hard physical labour, and I see no reason why
      I should be an exception."
    

      "It is foolish and trivial of you to talk of physical labour," said my
      father with some irritation. "Do try to understand, you idiot, and get it
      into your brainless head, that in addition to physical strength you have a
      divine spirit; a sacred fire, by which you are distinguished from an ass
      or a reptile and bringing you nigh to God. This sacred fire has been kept
      alight for thousands of years by the best of mankind. Your
      great-grandfather, General Pologniev, fought at Borodino; your grandfather
      was a poet, an orator, and a marshal of the nobility; your uncle was an
      educationalist; and I, your father, am an architect! Have all the
      Polognievs kept the sacred fire alight for you to put it out?"
    

      "There must be justice," said I. "Millions of people have to do manual
      labour."
    

      "Let them. They can do nothing else! Even a fool or a criminal can do
      manual labour. It is the mark of a slave and a barbarian, whereas the
      sacred fire is given only to a few!"
    

      It was useless to go on with the conversation. My father worshipped
      himself and would not be convinced by anything unless he said it himself.
      Besides, I knew quite well that the annoyance with which he spoke of
      unskilled labour came not so much from any regard for the sacred fire, as
      from a secret fear that I should become a working man and the talk of the
      town. But the chief thing was that all my schoolfellows had long ago gone
      through the University and were making careers for themselves, and the son
      of the director of the State Bank was already a collegiate assessor, while
      I, an only son, was nothing! It was useless and unpleasant to go on with
      the conversation, but I still sat there and raised objections in the hope
      of making myself understood. The problem was simple and clear: how was I
      to earn my living? But he could not see its simplicity and kept on talking
      with sugary rounded phrases about Borodino and the sacred fire, and my
      uncle, and the forgotten poet who wrote bad, insincere verses, and he
      called me a brainless fool. But how I longed to be understood! In spite of
      everything, I loved my father and my sister, and from boyhood I have had a
      habit of considering them, so strongly rooted that I shall probably never
      get rid of it; whether I am right or wrong I am always afraid of hurting
      them, and go in terror lest my father's thin neck should go red with anger
      and he should have an apoplectic fit.
    

      "It is shameful and degrading for a man of my age to sit in a stuffy room
      and compete with a typewriting-machine," I said. "What has that to do with
      the sacred fire?"
    

      "Still, it is intellectual work," said my father. "But that's enough. Let
      us drop the conversation and I warn you that if you refuse to return to
      your office and indulge your contemptible inclinations, then you will lose
      my love and your sister's. I shall cut you out of my will—that I
      swear, by God!"
    

      With perfect sincerity, in order to show the purity of my motives, by
      which I hope to be guided all through my life, I said:
    

      "The matter of inheritance does not strike me as important. I renounce any
      rights I may have."
    

      For some unexpected reason these words greatly offended my father. He went
      purple in the face.
    

      "How dare you talk to me like that, you fool!" he cried to me in a thin,
      shrill voice. "You scoundrel!" And he struck me quickly and dexterously
      with a familiar movement; once—twice. "You forget yourself!"
    

      When I was a boy and my father struck me, I used to stand bolt upright
      like a soldier and look him straight in the face; and, exactly as if I
      were still a boy, I stood erect, and tried to look into his eyes. My
      father was old and very thin, but his spare muscles must have been as
      strong as whip-cord, for he hit very hard.
    

      I returned to the hall, but there he seized his umbrella and struck me
      several times over the head and shoulders; at that moment my sister opened
      the drawing-room door to see what the noise was, but immediately drew back
      with an expression of pity and horror, and said not one word in my
      defence.
    

      My intention not to return to the office, but to start a new working life,
      was unshakable. It only remained to choose the kind of work—and
      there seemed to be no great difficulty about that, because I was strong,
      patient, and willing. I was prepared to face a monotonous, laborious life,
      of semi-starvation, filth, and rough surroundings, always overshadowed
      with the thought of finding a job and a living. And—who knows—returning
      from work in the Great Gentry Street, I might often envy Dolyhikov, the
      engineer, who lives by intellectual work, but I was happy in thinking of
      my coming troubles. I used to dream of intellectual activity, and to
      imagine myself a teacher, a doctor, a writer, but my dreams remained only
      dreams. A liking for intellectual pleasures—like the theatre and
      reading—grew into a passion with me, but I did not know whether I
      had any capacity for intellectual work. At school I had an unconquerable
      aversion for the Greek language, so that I had to leave when I was in the
      fourth class. Teachers were got to coach me up for the fifth class, and
      then I went into various departments, spending most of my time in perfect
      idleness, and this, I was told, was intellectual work.
    

      My activity in the education department or in the municipal office
      required neither mental effort, nor talent, nor personal ability, nor
      creative spiritual impulse; it was purely mechanical, and such
      intellectual work seemed to me lower than manual labour. I despise it and
      I do not think that it for a moment justifies an idle, careless life,
      because it is nothing but a swindle, and only a kind of idleness. In all
      probability I have never known real intellectual work.
    

      It was evening. We lived in Great Gentry Street—the chief street in
      the town—and our rank and fashion walked up and down it in the
      evenings, as there were no public gardens. The street was very charming,
      and was almost as good as a garden, for it had two rows of poplar-trees,
      which smelt very sweet, especially after rain, and acacias, and tall
      trees, and apple-trees hung over the fences and hedges. May evenings, the
      scent of the lilac, the hum of the cockchafers, the warm, still air—how
      new and extraordinary it all is, though spring comes every year! I stood
      by the gate and looked at the passers-by. With most of them I had grown up
      and had played with them, but now my presence might upset them, because I
      was poorly dressed, in unfashionable clothes, and people made fun of my
      very narrow trousers and large, clumsy boots, and called them
      macaroni-on-steamboats. And I had a bad reputation in the town because I
      had no position and went to play billiards in low cafés, and had
      once been taken up, for no particular offence, by the political police.
    

      In a large house opposite, Dolyhikov's, the engineer's, some one was
      playing the piano. It was beginning to get dark and the stars were
      beginning to shine. And slowly, answering people's salutes, my father
      passed with my sister on his arm. He was wearing an old top hat with a
      broad curly brim.
    

      "Look!" he said to my sister, pointing to the sky with the very umbrella
      with which he had just struck me. "Look at the sky! Even the smallest
      stars are worlds! How insignificant man is in comparison with the
      universe."
    

      And he said this in a tone that seemed to convey that he found it
      extremely flattering and pleasant to be so insignificant. What an
      untalented man he was! Unfortunately, he was the only architect in the
      town, and during the last fifteen or twenty years I could not remember one
      decent house being built. When he had to design a house, as a rule he
      would draw first the hall and the drawing-room; as in olden days
      schoolgirls could only begin to dance by the fireplace, so his artistic
      ideas could only evolve from the hall and drawing-room. To them he would
      add the dining-room, nursery, study, connecting them with doors, so that
      in the end they were just so many passages, and each room had two or three
      doors too many. His houses were obscure, extremely confused, and limited.
      Every time, as though he felt something was missing, he had recourse to
      various additions, plastering them one on top of the other, and there
      would be various lobbies, and passages, and crooked staircases leading to
      the entresol, where it was only possible to stand in a stooping position,
      and where instead of a floor there would be a thin flight of stairs like a
      Russian bath, and the kitchen would always be under the house with a
      vaulted ceiling and a brick floor. The front of his houses always had a
      hard, stubborn expression, with stiff, French lines, low, squat roofs, and
      fat, pudding-like chimneys surmounted with black cowls and squeaking
      weathercocks. And somehow all the houses built by my father were like each
      other, and vaguely reminded me of a top hat, and the stiff, obstinate back
      of his head. In the course of time the people of the town grew used to my
      father's lack of talent, which took root and became our style.
    

      My father introduced the style into my sister's life. To begin with, he
      gave her the name of Cleopatra (and he called me Misail). When she was a
      little girl he used to frighten her by telling her about the stars and our
      ancestors; and explained the nature of life and duty to her at great
      length; and now when she was twenty-six he went on in the same way,
      allowing her to take no one's arm but his own, and somehow imagining that
      sooner or later an ardent young man would turn up and wish to enter into
      marriage with her out of admiration for his qualities. And she adored my
      father, was afraid of him, and believed in his extraordinary intellectual
      powers.
    

      It got quite dark and the street grew gradually empty. In the house
      opposite the music stopped. The gate was wide open and out into the
      street, careering with all its bells jingling, came a troika. It was the
      engineer and his daughter going for a drive. Time to go to bed!
    

      I had a room in the house, but I lived in the courtyard in a hut, under
      the same roof as the coach-house, which had been built probably as a
      harness-room—for there were big nails in the walls—but now it
      was not used, and my father for thirty years had kept his newspapers
      there, which for some reason he had bound half-yearly and then allowed no
      one to touch. Living there I was less in touch with my father and his
      guests, and I used to think that if I did not live in a proper room and
      did not go to the house every day for meals, my father's reproach that I
      was living on him lost some of its sting.
    

      My sister was waiting for me. She had brought me supper unknown to my
      father; a small piece of cold veal and a slice of bread. In the family
      there were sayings: "Money loves an account," or "A copeck saves a
      rouble," and so on, and my sister, impressed by such wisdom, did her best
      to cut down expenses and made us feed rather meagrely. She put the plate
      on the table, sat on my bed, and began to cry.
    

      "Misail," she said, "what are you doing to us?"
    

      She did not cover her face, her tears ran down her cheeks and hands, and
      her expression was sorrowful. She fell on the pillow, gave way to her
      tears, trembling all over and sobbing.
    

      "You have left your work again!" she said. "How awful!"
    

      "Do try to understand, sister!" I said, and because she cried I was filled
      with despair.
    

      As though it were deliberately arranged, the paraffin in my little lamp
      ran out, and the lamp smoked and guttered, and the old hooks in the wall
      looked terrible and their shadows flickered.
    

      "Spare us!" said my sister, rising up. "Father is in an awful state, and I
      am ill. I shall go mad. What will become of you?" she asked, sobbing and
      holding out her hands to me. "I ask you, I implore you, in the name of our
      dear mother, to go back to your work."
    

      "I cannot, Cleopatra," I said, feeling that only a little more would make
      me give in. "I cannot."
    

      "Why?" insisted my sister, "why? If you have not made it up with your
      chief, look for another place. For instance, why shouldn't you work on the
      railway? I have just spoken to Aniuta Blagovo, and she assures me you
      would be taken on, and she even promised to do what she could for you. For
      goodness sake, Misail, think! Think it over, I implore you!"
    

      We talked a little longer and I gave in. I said that the thought of
      working on the railway had never come into my head, and that I was ready
      to try.
    

      She smiled happily through her tears and clasped my hand, and still she
      cried, because she could not stop, and I went into the kitchen for
      paraffin.
    

      II
    

      Among the supporters of amateur theatricals, charity concerts, and tableaux
      vivants the leaders were the Azhoguins, who lived in their own house
      in Great Gentry house the Street. They used to lend their house and assume
      the necessary trouble and expense. They were a rich landowning family, and
      had about three thousand urskins, with a magnificent farm in the
      neighbourhood, but they did not care for village life and lived in the
      town summer and winter. The family consisted of a mother, a tall, spare,
      delicate lady, who had short hair, wore a blouse and a plain skirt
      à l'Anglais, and three daughters, who were spoken of, not by their
      names, but as the eldest, the middle, and the youngest; they all had ugly,
      sharp chins, and they were short-sighted, high-shouldered, dressed in the
      same style as their mother, had an unpleasant lisp, and yet they always
      took part in every play and were always doing something for charity—acting,
      reciting, singing. They were very serious and never smiled, and even in
      burlesque operettas they acted without gaiety and with a businesslike air,
      as though they were engaged in bookkeeping.
    

      I loved our plays, especially the rehearsals, which were frequent, rather
      absurd, and noisy, and we were always given supper after them. I had no
      part in the selection of the pieces and the casting of the characters. I
      had to look after the stage. I used to design the scenery and copy out the
      parts, and prompt and make up. And I also had to look after the various
      effects such as thunder, the singing of a nightingale, and so on. Having
      no social position, I had no decent clothes, and during rehearsals had to
      hold aloof from the others in the darkened wings and shyly say nothing.
    

      I used to paint the scenery in the Azhoguins' coach-house or yard. I was
      assisted by a house-painter, or, as he called himself, a decorating
      contractor, named Andrey Ivanov, a man of about fifty, tall and very thin
      and pale, with a narrow chest, hollow temples, and dark rings under his
      eyes, he was rather awful to look at. He had some kind of wasting disease,
      and every spring and autumn he was said to be on the point of death, but
      he would go to bed for a while and then get up and say with surprise: "I'm
      not dead this time!"
    

      In the town he was called Radish, and people said it was his real name. He
      loved the theatre as much as I, and no sooner did he hear that a play was
      in hand than he gave up all his work and went to the Azhoguins' to paint
      scenery.
    

      The day after my conversation with my sister I worked from morning till
      night at the Azhoguins'. The rehearsal was fixed for seven o'clock, and an
      hour before it began all the players were assembled, and the eldest, the
      middle, and the youngest Miss Azhoguin were reading their parts on the
      stage. Radish, in a long, brown overcoat with a scarf wound round his
      neck, was standing, leaning with his head against the wall, looking at the
      stage with a rapt expression. Mrs. Azhoguin went from guest to guest
      saying something pleasant to every one. She had a way of gazing into one's
      face and speaking in a hushed voice as though she were telling a secret.
    

      "It must be difficult to paint scenery," she said softly, coming up to me.
      "I was just talking to Mrs. Mufke about prejudice when I saw you come in.
      Mon Dieu! All my life I have struggled against prejudice. To convince the
      servants that all their superstitions are nonsense I always light three
      candles, and I begin all my important business on the thirteenth."
    

      The daughter of Dolyhikov, the engineer, was there, a handsome, plump,
      fair girl, dressed, as people said in our town, in Parisian style. She did
      not act, but at rehearsals a chair was put for her on the stage, and the
      plays did not begin until she appeared in the front row, to astonish
      everybody with the brilliance of her clothes. As coming from the
      metropolis, she was allowed to make remarks during rehearsals, and she did
      so with an affable, condescending smile, and it was clear that she
      regarded our plays as a childish amusement. It was said that she had
      studied singing at the Petersburg conservatoire and had sung for a winter
      season in opera. I liked her very much, and during rehearsals or the
      performance, I never took my eyes off her.
    

      I had taken the book and began to prompt when suddenly my sister appeared.
      Without taking off her coat and hat she came up to me and said:
    

      "Please come!"
    

      I went. Behind the stage in the doorway stood Aniuta Blagovo, also wearing
      a hat with a dark veil. She was the daughter of the vice-president of the
      Court, who had been appointed to our town years ago, almost as soon as the
      High Court was established. She was tall and had a good figure, and was
      considered indispensable for the tableaux vivants, and when she
      represented a fairy or a muse, her face would burn with shame; but she
      took no part in the plays, and would only look in at rehearsals, on some
      business, and never enter the hall. And it was evident now that she had
      only looked in for a moment.
    

      "My father has mentioned you," she said drily, not looking at me and
      blushing.... "Dolyhikov has promised to find you something to do on the
      railway. If you go to his house to-morrow, he will see you."
    

      I bowed and thanked her for her kindness.
    

      "And you must leave this," she said, pointing to my book.
    

      She and my sister went up to Mrs. Azhoguin and began to whisper, looking
      at me.
    

      "Indeed," said Mrs. Azhoguin, coming up to me, and gazing into my face.
      "Indeed, if it takes you from your more serious business"—she took
      the book out of my hands—"then you must hand it over to some one
      else. Don't worry, my friend. It will be all right."
    

      I said good-bye and left in some confusion. As I went down-stairs I saw my
      sister and Aniuta Blagovo going away; they were talking animatedly, I
      suppose about my going on the railway, and they hurried away. My sister
      had never been to a rehearsal before, and she was probably tortured by her
      conscience and by her fear of my father finding out that she had been to
      the Azhoguins' without permission.
    

      The next day I went to see Dolyhikov at one o'clock. The man servant
      showed me into a charming room, which was the engineer's drawing-room and
      study. Everything in it was charming and tasteful, and to a man like
      myself, unused to such things, very strange. Costly carpets, huge chairs,
      bronzes, pictures in gold and velvet frames; photographs on the walls of
      beautiful women, clever, handsome faces, and striking attitudes; from the
      drawing-room a door led straight into the garden, by a veranda, and I saw
      lilac and a table laid for breakfast, rolls, and a bunch of roses; and
      there was a smell of spring, and good cigars, and happiness—and
      everything seemed to say, here lives a man who has worked and won the
      highest happiness here on earth. At the table the engineer's daughter was
      sitting reading a newspaper.
    

      "Do you want my father?" she asked. "He is having a shower-bath. He will
      be down presently. Please take a chair."
    

      I sat down.
    

      "I believe you live opposite?" she asked after a short silence.
    

      "Yes."
    

      "When I have nothing to do I look out of the window. You must excuse me,"
      she added, turning to her newspaper, "and I often see you and your sister.
      She has such a kind, wistful expression."
    

      Dolyhikov came in. He was wiping his neck with a towel.
    

      "Papa, this is Mr. Pologniev," said his daughter.
    

      "Yes, yes. Blagovo spoke to me." He turned quickly to me, but did not hold
      out his hand. "But what do you think I can give you? I'm not bursting with
      situations. You are queer people!" he went on in a loud voice and as
      though he were scolding me. "I get about twenty people every day, as
      though I were a Department of State. I run a railway, sir. I employ hard
      labour; I need mechanics, navvies, joiners, well-sinkers, and you can only
      sit and write. That's all! You are all clerks!"
    

      And he exhaled the same air of happiness as his carpets and chairs. He was
      stout, healthy, with red cheeks and a broad chest; he looked clean in his
      pink shirt and wide trousers, just like a china figure of a post-boy. He
      had a round, bristling beard—and not a single grey hair—and a
      nose with a slight bridge, and bright, innocent, dark eyes.
    

      "What can you do?" he went on. "Nothing! I am an engineer and well-to-do,
      but before I was given this railway I worked very hard for a long time. I
      was an engine-driver for two years, I worked in Belgium as an ordinary
      lubricator. Now, my dear man, just think—what work can I offer you?"
    

      "I quite agree," said I, utterly abashed, not daring to meet his bright,
      innocent eyes.
    

      "Are you any good with the telegraph?" he asked after some thought.
    

      "Yes. I have been in the telegraph service."
    

      "Hm.... Well, we'll see. Go to Dubechnia. There's a fellow there already.
      But he is a scamp."
    

      "And what will my duties be?" I asked.
    

      "We'll see to that later. Go there now. I'll give orders. But please don't
      drivel and don't bother me with petitions or I'll kick you out."
    

      He turned away from me without even a nod. I bowed to him and his
      daughter, who was reading the newspaper, and went out. I felt so miserable
      that when my sister asked how the engineer had received me, I could not
      utter a single word.
    

      To go to Dubechnia I got up early in the morning at sunrise. There was not
      a soul in the street, the whole town was asleep, and my footsteps rang out
      with a hollow sound. The dewy poplars filled the air with a soft scent. I
      was sad and had no desire to leave the town. It seemed so nice and warm! I
      loved the green trees, the quiet sunny mornings, the ringing of the bells,
      but the people in the town were alien to me, tiresome and sometimes even
      loathsome. I neither liked nor understood them.
    

      I did not understand why or for what purpose those thirty-five thousand
      people lived. I knew that Kimry made a living by manufacturing boots, that
      Tula made samovars and guns, that Odessa was a port; but I did not know
      what our town was or what it did. The people in Great Gentry Street and
      two other clean streets had independent means and salaries paid by the
      Treasury, but how the people lived in the other eight streets which
      stretched parallel to each other for three miles and then were lost behind
      the hill—that was always an insoluble problem to me. And I am
      ashamed to think of the way they lived. They had neither public gardens,
      nor a theatre, nor a decent orchestra; the town and club libraries are
      used only by young Jews, so that books and magazines would lie for months
      uncut. The rich and the intelligentsia slept in close, stuffy bedrooms,
      with wooden beds infested with bugs; the children were kept in filthy,
      dirty rooms called nurseries, and the servants, even when they were old
      and respectable, slept on the kitchen floor and covered themselves with
      rags. Except in Lent all the houses smelt of bortsch, and during
      Lent of sturgeon fried in sunflower oil. The food was unsavoury, the water
      unwholesome. On the town council, at the governor's, at the archbishop's,
      everywhere there had been talk for years about there being no good, cheap
      water-supply and of borrowing two hundred thousand roubles from the
      Treasury. Even the very rich people, of whom there were about thirty in
      the town, people who would lose a whole estate at cards, used to drink the
      bad water and talk passionately about the loan—and I could never
      understand this, for it seemed to me it would be simpler for them to pay
      up the two hundred thousand.
    

      I did not know a single honest man in the whole town. My father took
      bribes, and imagined they were given to him out of respect for his
      spiritual qualities; the boys at the high school, in order to be promoted,
      went to lodge with the masters and paid them large sums; the wife of the
      military commandant took levies from the recruits during the recruiting,
      and even allowed them to stand her drinks, and once she was so drunk in
      church that she could not get up from her knees; during the recruiting the
      doctors also took bribes, and the municipal doctor and the veterinary
      surgeon levied taxes on the butcher shops and public houses; the district
      school did a trade in certificates which gave certain privileges in the
      civil service; the provosts took bribes from the clergy and church-wardens
      whom they controlled, and on the town council and various committees every
      one who came before them was pursued with: "One expects thanks!"—and
      thereby forty copecks had to change hands. And those who did not take
      bribes, like the High Court officials, were stiff and proud, and shook
      hands with two fingers, and were distinguished by their indifference and
      narrow-mindedness. They drank and played cards, married rich women, and
      always had a bad, insidious influence on those round them. Only the girls
      had any moral purity; most of them had lofty aspirations and were pure and
      honest at heart; but they knew nothing of life, and believed that bribes
      were given to honour spiritual qualities; and when they married, they soon
      grew old and weak, and were hopelessly lost in the mire of that vulgar,
      bourgeois existence.
    

      III
    

      A railway was being built in our district. On holidays and thereabouts the
      town was filled with crowds of ragamuffins called "railies," of whom the
      people were afraid. I used often to see a miserable wretch with a bloody
      face, and without a hat, being dragged off by the police, and behind him
      was the proof of his crime, a samovar or some wet, newly washed linen. The
      "railies" used to collect near the public houses and on the squares; and
      they drank, ate, and swore terribly, and whistled after the town
      prostitutes. To amuse these ruffians our shopkeepers used to make the cats
      and dogs drink vodka, or tie a kerosene-tin to a dog's tail, and whistle
      to make the dog come tearing along the street with the tin clattering
      after him, and making him squeal with terror and think he had some
      frightful monster hard at his heels, so that he would rush out of the town
      and over the fields until he could run no more. We had several dogs in the
      town which were left with a permanent shiver and used to crawl about with
      their tails between their legs, and people said that they could not stand
      such tricks and had gone mad.
    

      The station was being built five miles from the town. It was said that the
      engineer had asked for a bribe of fifty thousand roubles to bring the
      station nearer, but the municipality would only agree to forty; they would
      not give in to the extra ten thousand, and now the townspeople are sorry
      because they had to make a road to the station which cost them more.
      Sleepers and rails were fixed all along the line, and service-trains were
      running to carry building materials and labourers, and they were only
      waiting for the bridges upon which Dolyhikov was at work, and here and
      there the stations were not ready.
    

      Dubechnia—the name of our first station—was seventeen versts
      from the town. I went on foot. The winter and spring corn was bright
      green, shining in the morning sun. The road was smooth and bright, and in
      the distance I could see in outline the station, the hills, and the remote
      farmhouses.... How good it was out in the open! And how I longed to be
      filled with the sense of freedom, if only for that morning, to stop
      thinking of what was going on in the town, or of my needs, or even of
      eating! Nothing has so much prevented my living as the feeling of acute
      hunger, which make my finest thoughts get mixed up with thoughts of
      porridge, cutlets, and fried fish. When I stand alone in the fields and
      look up at the larks hanging marvellously in the air, and bursting with
      hysterical song, I think: "It would be nice to have some bread and
      butter." Or when I sit in the road and shut my eyes and listen to the
      wonderful sounds of a May-day, I remember how good hot potatoes smell.
      Being big and of a strong constitution I never have quite enough to eat,
      and so my chief sensation during the day is hunger, and so I can
      understand why so many people who are working for a bare living, can talk
      of nothing but food.
    

      At Dubechnia the station was being plastered inside, and the upper story
      of the water-tank was being built. It was close and smelt of lime, and the
      labourers were wandering lazily over piles of chips and rubbish. The
      signalman was asleep near his box with the sun pouring straight into his
      face. There was not a single tree. The telephone gave a faint hum, and
      here and there birds had alighted on it. I wandered over the heaps, not
      knowing what to do, and remembered how when I asked the engineer what my
      duties would be, he had replied: "We will see there." But what was there
      to see in such a wilderness? The plasterers were talking about the foreman
      and about one Fedot Vassilievich. I could not understand and was filled
      with embarrassment—physical embarrassment. I felt conscious of my
      arms and legs, and of the whole of my big body, and did not know what to
      do with them or where to go.
    

      After walking for at least a couple of hours I noticed that from the
      station to the right of the line there were telegraph-poles which after
      about one and a half or two miles ended in a white stone wall. The
      labourers said it was the office, and I decided at last that I must go
      there.
    

      It was a very old farmhouse, long unused. The wall of rough, white stone
      was decayed, and in places had crumbled away, and the roof of the wing,
      the blind wall of which looked toward the railway, had perished, and was
      patched here and there with tin. Through the gates there was a large yard,
      overgrown with tall grass, and beyond that, an old house with Venetian
      blinds in the windows, and a high roof, brown with rot. On either side of
      the house, to right and left, were two symmetrical wings; the windows of
      one were boarded up, while by the other, the windows of which were open,
      there were a number of calves grazing. The last telegraph-pole stood in
      the yard, and the wire went from it to the wing with the blind wall. The
      door was open and I went in. By the table at the telegraph was sitting a
      man with a dark, curly head in a canvas coat; he glared at me sternly and
      askance, but he immediately smiled and said:
    

      "How do you do, Profit?"
    

      It was Ivan Cheprakov, my school friend, who was expelled, when he was in
      the second class, for smoking. Once, during the autumn, we were out
      catching goldfinches, starlings, and hawfinches, to sell them in the
      market early in the morning when our parents were still asleep.
    

      We beat up flocks of starlings and shot at them with pellets, and then
      picked up the wounded, and some died in terrible agony—I can still
      remember how they moaned at night in my case—and some recovered. And
      we sold them, and swore black and blue that they were male birds. Once in
      the market I had only one starling left, which I hawked about and finally
      sold for a copeck. "A little profit!" I said to console myself, and from
      that time at school I was always known as "Little Profit," and even now,
      schoolboys and the townspeople sometimes use the name to tease me, though
      no one but myself remembers how it came about.
    

      Cheprakov never was strong. He was narrow-chested, round-shouldered,
      long-legged. His tie looked like a piece of string, he had no waistcoat,
      and his boots were worse than mine—with the heels worn down. He
      blinked with his eyes and had an eager expression as though he were trying
      to catch something and he was in a constant fidget.
    

      "You wait," he said, bustling about. "Look here!... What was I saying just
      now?"
    

      We began to talk. I discovered that the estate had till recently belonged
      to the Cheprakovs and only the previous autumn had passed to Dolyhikov,
      who thought it more profitable to keep his money in land than in shares,
      and had already bought three big estates in our district with the transfer
      of all mortgages. When Cheprakov's mother sold, she stipulated for the
      right to live in one of the wings for another two years and got her son a
      job in the office.
    

      "Why shouldn't he buy?" said Cheprakov of the engineer. "He gets a lot
      from the contractors. He bribes them all."
    

      Then he took me to dinner, deciding in his emphatic way that I was to live
      with him in the wing and board with his mother.
    

      "She is a screw," he said, "but she will not take much from you."
    

      In the small rooms where his mother lived there was a queer jumble; even
      the hall and the passage were stacked with furniture, which had been taken
      from the house after the sale of the estate; and the furniture was old,
      and of redwood. Mrs. Cheprakov, a very stout elderly lady, with slanting,
      Chinese eyes, sat by the window, in a big chair, knitting a stocking. She
      received me ceremoniously.
    

      "It is Pologniev, mother," said Cheprakov, introducing me. "He is going to
      work here."
    

      "Are you a nobleman?" she asked in a strange, unpleasant voice as though
      she had boiling fat in her throat.
    

      "Yes," I answered.
    

      "Sit down."
    

      The dinner was bad. It consisted only of a pie with unsweetened curds and
      some milk soup. Elena Nikifirovna, my hostess, was perpetually winking,
      first with one eye, then with the other. She talked and ate, but in her
      whole aspect there was a deathlike quality, and one could almost detect
      the smell of a corpse. Life hardly stirred in her, yet she had the air of
      being the lady of the manor, who had once had her serfs, and was the wife
      of a general, whose servants had to call him "Your Excellency," and when
      these miserable embers of life flared up in her for a moment, she would
      say to her son:
    

      "Ivan, that is not the way to hold your knife!"
    

      Or she would say, gasping for breath, with the preciseness of a hostess
      labouring to entertain her guest:
    

      "We have just sold our estate, you know. It is a pity, of course, we have
      got so used to being here, but Dolyhikov promised to make Ivan
      station-master at Dubechnia, so that we shan't have to leave. We shall
      live here on the station, which is the same as living on the estate. The
      engineer is such a nice man! Don't you think him very handsome?"
    

      Until recently the Cheprakovs had been very well-to-do, but with the
      general's death everything changed. Elena Nikifirovna began to quarrel
      with the neighbours and to go to law, and she did not pay her bailiffs and
      labourers; she was always afraid of being robbed—and in less than
      ten years Dubechnia changed completely.
    

      Behind the house there was an old garden run wild, overgrown with tall
      grass and brushwood. I walked along the terrace which was still well-kept
      and beautiful; through the glass door I saw a room with a parquet floor,
      which must have been the drawing-room. It contained an ancient piano, some
      engravings in mahogany frames on the walls—and nothing else. There
      was nothing left of the flower-garden but peonies and poppies, rearing
      their white and scarlet heads above the ground; on the paths, all huddled
      together, were young maples and elm-trees, which had been stripped by the
      cows. The growth was dense and the garden seemed impassable, and only near
      the house, where there still stood poplars, firs, and some old bricks,
      were there traces of the former avenues, and further on the garden was
      being cleared for a hay-field, and here it was no longer allowed to run
      wild, and one's mouth and eyes were no longer filled with spiders' webs,
      and a pleasant air was stirring. The further out one went, the more open
      it was, and there were cherry-trees, plum-trees, wide-spreading old
      apple-trees, lichened and held up with props, and the pear-trees were so
      tall that it was incredible that there could be pears on them. This part
      of the garden was let to the market-women of our town, and it was guarded
      from thieves and starlings by a peasant—an idiot who lived in a hut.
    

      The orchard grew thinner and became a mere meadow running down to the
      river, which was overgrown with reeds and withy-beds. There was a pool by
      the mill-dam, deep and full of fish, and a little mill with a straw roof
      ground and roared, and the frogs croaked furiously. On the water, which
      was as smooth as glass, circles appeared from time to time, and
      water-lilies trembled on the impact of a darting fish. The village of
      Dubechnia was on the other side of the river. The calm, azure pool was
      alluring with its promise of coolness and rest. And now all this, the
      pool, the mill, the comfortable banks of the river, belonged to the
      engineer!
    

      And here my new work began. I received and despatched telegrams, I wrote
      out various accounts and copied orders, claims, and reports, sent in to
      the office by our illiterate foremen and mechanics. But most of the day I
      did nothing, walking up and down the room waiting for telegrams, or I
      would tell the boy to stay in the wing, and go into the garden until the
      boy came to say the bell was ringing. I had dinner with Mrs. Cheprakov.
      Meat was served very rarely; most of the dishes were made of milk, and on
      Wednesdays and Fridays we had Lenten fare, and the food was served in pink
      plates, which were called Lenten. Mrs. Cheprakov was always blinking—the
      habit grew on her, and I felt awkward and embarrassed in her presence.
    

      As there was not enough work for one, Cheprakov did nothing, but slept or
      went down to the pool with his gun to shoot ducks. In the evenings he got
      drunk in the village, or at the station, and before going to bed he would
      look in the glass and say:
    

      "How are you, Ivan Cheprakov?"
    

      When he was drunk, he was very pale and used to rub his hands and laugh,
      or rather neigh, He-he-he! Out of bravado he would undress himself and run
      naked through the fields, and he used to eat flies and say they were a bit
      sour.
    

      IV
    

      Once after dinner he came running into the wing, panting, to say:
    

      "Your sister has come to see you."
    

      I went out and saw a fly standing by the steps of the house. My sister had
      brought Aniuta Blagovo and a military gentleman in a summer uniform. As I
      approached I recognised the military gentleman as Aniuta's brother, the
      doctor.
    

      "We've come to take you for a picnic," he said, "if you've no objection."
    

      My sister and Aniuta wanted to ask how I was getting on, but they were
      both silent and only looked at me. They felt that I didn't like my job,
      and tears came into my sister's eyes and Aniuta Blagovo blushed. We went
      into the orchard, the doctor first, and he said ecstatically:
    

      "What air! By Jove, what air!"
    

      He was just a boy to look at. He talked and walked like an undergraduate,
      and the look in his grey eyes was as lively, simple, and frank as that of
      a nice boy. Compared with his tall, handsome sister he looked weak and
      slight, and his little beard was thin and so was his voice—a thin
      tenor, though quite pleasant. He was away somewhere with his regiment and
      had come home on leave, and said that he was going to Petersburg in the
      autumn to take his M.D. He already had a family—a wife and three
      children; he had married young, in his second year at the University, and
      people said he was unhappily married and was not living with his wife.
    

      "What is the time?" My sister was uneasy. "We must go back soon, for my
      father would only let me have until six o'clock."
    

      "Oh, your father," sighed the doctor.
    

      I made tea, and we drank it sitting on a carpet in front of the terrace,
      and the doctor, kneeling, drank from his saucer, and said that he was
      perfectly happy. Then Cheprakov fetched the key and unlocked the glass
      door and we all entered the house. It was dark and mysterious and smelled
      of mushrooms, and our footsteps made a hollow sound as though there were a
      vault under the floor. The doctor stopped by the piano and touched the
      keys and it gave out a faint, tremulous, cracked but still melodious
      sound. He raised his voice and began to sing a romance, frowning and
      impatiently stamping his foot when he touched a broken key. My sister
      forgot about going home, but walked agitatedly up and down the room and
      said:
    

      "I am happy! I am very, very happy!"
    

      There was a note of surprise in her voice as though it seemed impossible
      to her that she should be happy. It was the first time in my life that I
      had seen her so gay. She even looked handsome. Her profile was not good,
      her nose and mouth somehow protruded and made her look as if she was
      always blowing, but she had beautiful, dark eyes, a pale, very delicate
      complexion, and a touching expression of kindness and sadness, and when
      she spoke she seemed very charming and even beautiful. Both she and I took
      after our mother; we were broad-shouldered, strong, and sturdy, but her
      paleness was a sign of sickness, she often coughed, and in her eyes I
      often noticed the expression common to people who are ill, but who for
      some reason conceal it. In her present cheerfulness there was something
      childish and naïve, as though all the joy which had been suppressed
      and dulled during our childhood by a strict upbringing, had suddenly
      awakened in her soul and rushed out into freedom.
    

      But when evening came and the fly was brought round, my sister became very
      quiet and subdued, and sat in the fly as though it were a prison-van.
    

      Soon they were all gone. The noise of the fly died away.... I remembered
      that Aniuta Blagovo had said not a single word to me all day.
    

      "A wonderful girl!" I thought "A wonderful girl."
    

      Lent came and every day we had Lenten dishes. I was greatly depressed by
      my idleness and the uncertainty of my position, and, slothful, hungry,
      dissatisfied with myself, I wandered over the estate and only waited for
      an energetic mood to leave the place.
    

      Once in the afternoon when Radish was sitting in our wing, Dolyhikov
      entered unexpectedly, very sunburnt, and grey with dust. He had been out
      on the line for three days and had come to Dubechnia on a locomotive and
      walked over. While he waited for the carriage which he had ordered to come
      out to meet him he went over the estate with his bailiff, giving orders in
      a loud voice, and then for a whole hour he sat in our wing and wrote
      letters. When telegrams came through for him, he himself tapped out the
      answers, while we stood there stiff and silent.
    

      "What a mess!" he said, looking angrily through the accounts. "I shall
      transfer the office to the station in a fortnight and I don't know what I
      shall do with you then."
    

      "I've done my best, sir," said Cheprakov.
    

      "Quite so. I can see what your best is. You can only draw your wages." The
      engineer looked at me and went on. "You rely on getting introductions to
      make a career for yourself with as little trouble as possible. Well, I
      don't care about introductions. Nobody helped me. Before I had this line,
      I was an engine-driver. I worked in Belgium as an ordinary lubricator. And
      what are you doing here, Panteley?" he asked, turning to Radish. "Going
      out drinking?"
    

      For some reason or other he called all simple people Panteley, while he
      despised men like Cheprakov and myself, and called us drunkards, beasts,
      canaille. As a rule he was hard on petty officials, and paid and dismissed
      them ruthlessly without any explanation.
    

      At last the carriage came for him. When he left he promised to dismiss us
      all in a fortnight; called the bailiff a fool, stretched himself out
      comfortably in the carriage, and drove away.
    

      "Andrey Ivanich," I said to Radish, "will you take me on as a labourer?"
    

      "What! Why?"
    

      We went together toward the town, and when the station and the farm were
      far behind us, I asked:
    

      "Andrey Ivanich, why did you come to Dubechnia?"
    

      "Firstly because some of my men are working on the line, and secondly to
      pay interest to Mrs. Cheprakov. I borrowed fifty roubles from her last
      summer, and now I pay her one rouble a month."
    

      The decorator stopped and took hold of my coat.
    

      "Misail Alereich, my friend," he went on, "I take it that if a common man
      or a gentleman takes interest, he is a wrong-doer. The truth is not in
      him."
    

      Radish, looking thin, pale, and rather terrible, shut his eyes, shook his
      head, and muttered in a philosophic tone:
    

      "The grub eats grass, rust eats iron, lies devour the soul. God save us
      miserable sinners!"
    

      V
    

      Radish was unpractical and he was no business man; he undertook more work
      than he could do, and when he came to payment he always lost his reckoning
      and so was always out on the wrong side. He was a painter, a glazier, a
      paper-hanger, and would even take on tiling, and I remember how he used to
      run about for days looking for tiles to make an insignificant profit. He
      was an excellent workman and would sometimes earn ten roubles a day, and
      but for his desire to be a master and to call himself a contractor, he
      would probably have made quite a lot of money.
    

      He himself was paid by contract and paid me and the others by the day,
      between seventy-five copecks and a rouble per day. When the weather was
      hot and dry he did various outside jobs, chiefly painting roofs. Not being
      used to it, my feet got hot, as though I were walking over a red-hot oven,
      and when I wore felt boots my feet swelled. But this was only at the
      beginning. Later on I got used to it and everything went all right. I
      lived among the people, to whom work was obligatory and unavoidable,
      people who worked like dray-horses, and knew nothing of the moral value of
      labour, and never even used the word "labour" in their talk. Among them I
      also felt like a dray-horse, more and more imbued with the necessity and
      inevitability of what I was doing, and this made my life easier, and saved
      me from doubt.
    

      At first everything amused me, everything was new. It was like being born
      again. I could sleep on the ground and go barefoot—and found it
      exceedingly pleasant. I could stand in a crowd of simple folks, without
      embarrassing them, and when a cab-horse fell down in the street, I used to
      run and help it up without being afraid of soiling my clothes. But, best
      of all, I was living independently and was not a burden on any one.
    

      The painting of roofs, especially when we mixed our own paint, was
      considered a very profitable business, and, therefore, even such good
      workmen as Radish did not shun this rough and tiresome work. In short
      trousers, showing his lean, muscular legs, he used to prowl over the roof
      like a stork, and I used to hear him sigh wearily as he worked his brush:
    

      "Woe, woe to us, miserable sinners!"
    

      He could walk as easily on a roof as on the ground. In spite of his
      looking so ill and pale and corpse-like, his agility was extraordinary;
      like any young man he would paint the cupola and the top of the church
      without scaffolding, using only ladders and a rope, and it was queer and
      strange when, standing there, far above the ground, he would rise to his
      full height and cry to the world at large:
    

      "Grubs eat grass, rust eats iron, lies devour the soul!"
    

      Or, thinking of something, he would suddenly answer his own thought:
    

      "Anything may happen! Anything may happen!"
    

      When I went home from work all the people sitting outside their doors, the
      shop assistants, dogs, and their masters, used to shout after me and jeer
      spitefully, and at first it seemed monstrous and distressed me greatly.
    

      "Little Profit," they used to shout. "House-painter! Yellow ochre!"
    

      And no one treated me so unmercifully as those who had only just risen
      above the people and had quite recently had to work for their living. Once
      in the market-place as I passed the ironmonger's a can of water was
      spilled over me as if by accident, and once a stick was thrown at me. And
      once a fishmonger, a grey-haired old man, stood in my way and looked at me
      morosely and said:
    

      "It isn't you I'm sorry for, you fool, it's your father."
    

      And when my acquaintances met me they got confused. Some regarded me as a
      queer fish and a fool, and they were sorry for me; others did not know how
      to treat me and it was difficult to understand them. Once, in the daytime,
      in one of the streets off Great Gentry Street, I met Aniuta Blagovo. I was
      on my way to my work and was carrying two long brushes and a pot of paint.
      When she recognised me, Aniuta blushed.
    

      "Please do not acknowledge me in the street," she said nervously, sternly,
      in a trembling voice, without offering to shake hands with me, and tears
      suddenly gleamed in her eyes. "If you must be like this, then, so—so
      be it, but please avoid me in public!"
    

      I had left Great Gentry Street and was living in a suburb called Makarikha
      with my nurse Karpovna, a good-natured but gloomy old woman who was always
      looking for evil, and was frightened by her dreams, and saw omens and ill
      in the bees and wasps which flew into her room. And in her opinion my
      having become a working man boded no good.
    

      "You are lost!" she said mournfully, shaking her head. "Lost!"
    

      With her in her little house lived her adopted son, Prokofyi, a butcher, a
      huge, clumsy fellow, of about thirty, with ginger hair and scrubby
      moustache. When he met me in the hall, he would silently and respectfully
      make way for me, and when he was drunk he would salute me with his whole
      hand. In the evenings he used to have supper, and through the wooden
      partition I could hear him snorting and snuffling as he drank glass after
      glass.
    

      "Mother," he would say in an undertone.
    

      "Well," Karpovna would reply. She was passionately fond of him. "What is
      it, my son?"
    

      "I'll do you a favour, mother. I'll feed you in your old age in this vale
      of tears, and when you die I'll bury you at my own expense. So I say and
      so I'll do."
    

      I used to get up every day before sunrise and go to bed early. We painters
      ate heavily and slept soundly, and only during the night would we have any
      excitement. I never quarrelled with my comrades. All day long there was a
      ceaseless stream of abuse, cursing and hearty good wishes, as, for
      instance, that one's eyes should burst, or that one might be carried off
      by cholera, but, all the same, among ourselves we were very friendly. The
      men suspected me of being a religious crank and used to laugh at me
      good-naturedly, saying that even my own father denounced me, and they used
      to say that they very seldom went to church and that many of them had not
      been to confession for ten years, and they justified their laxness by
      saying that a decorator is among men like a jackdaw among birds.
    

      My mates respected me and regarded me with esteem; they evidently liked my
      not drinking or smoking, and leading a quiet, steady life. They were only
      rather disagreeably surprised at my not stealing the oil, or going with
      them to ask our employers for a drink. The stealing of the employers' oil
      and paint was a custom with house-painters, and was not regarded as theft,
      and it was remarkable that even so honest a man as Radish would always
      come away from work with some white lead and oil. And even respectable old
      men who had their own houses in Makarikha were not ashamed to ask for
      tips, and when the men, at the beginning or end of a job, made up to some
      vulgar fool and thanked him humbly for a few pence, I used to feel sick
      and sorry.
    

      With the customers they behaved like sly courtiers, and almost every day I
      was reminded of Shakespeare's Polonius.
    

      "There will probably be rain," a customer would say, staring at the sky.
    

      "It is sure to rain," the painters would agree.
    

      "But the clouds aren't rain-clouds. Perhaps it won't rain."
    

      "No, sir. It won't rain. It won't rain, sure."
    

      Behind their backs they generally regarded the customers ironically, and
      when, for instance, they saw a gentleman sitting on his balcony with a
      newspaper, they would say:
    

      "He reads newspapers, but he has nothing to eat."
    

      I never visited my people. When I returned from work I often found short,
      disturbing notes from my sister about my father; how he was very
      absent-minded at dinner, and then slipped away and locked himself in his
      study and did not come out for a long time. Such news upset me. I could
      not sleep, and I would go sometimes at night and walk along Great Gentry
      Street by our house, and look up at the dark windows, and try to guess if
      all was well within. On Sundays my sister would come to see me, but by
      stealth, as though she came not to see me, but my nurse. And if she came
      into my room she would look pale, with her eyes red, and at once she would
      begin to weep.
    

      "Father cannot bear it much longer," she would say. "If, as God forbid,
      something were to happen to him, it would be on your conscience all your
      life. It is awful, Misail! For mother's sake I implore you to mend your
      ways."
    

      "My dear sister," I replied. "How can I reform when I am convinced that I
      am acting according to my conscience? Do try to understand me!"
    

      "I know you are obeying your conscience, but it ought to be possible to do
      so without hurting anybody."
    

      "Oh, saints above!" the old woman would sigh behind the door. "You are
      lost. There will be a misfortune, my dear. It is bound to come."
    

      VI
    

      On Sunday, Doctor Blagovo came to see me unexpectedly. He was wearing a
      white summer uniform over a silk shirt, and high glacé boots.
    

      "I came to see you!" he began, gripping my hand in his hearty,
      undergraduate fashion. "I hear of you every day and I have long intended
      to go and see you to have a heart-to-heart, as they say. Things are
      awfully boring in the town; there is not a living soul worth talking to.
      How hot it is, by Jove!" he went on, taking off his tunic and standing in
      his silk shirt. "My dear fellow, let us have a talk."
    

      I was feeling bored and longing for other society than that of the
      decorators. I was really glad to see him.
    

      "To begin with," he said, sitting on my bed, "I sympathise with you
      heartily, and I have a profound respect for your present way of living. In
      the town you are misunderstood and there is nobody to understand you,
      because, as you know, it is full of Gogolian pig-faces. But I guessed what
      you were at the picnic. You are a noble soul, an honest, high-minded man!
      I respect you and think it an honour to shake hands with you. To change
      your life so abruptly and suddenly as you did, you must have passed
      through a most trying spiritual process, and to go on with it now, to live
      scrupulously by your convictions, you must have to toil incessantly both
      in mind and in heart. Now, please tell me, don't you think that if you
      spent all this force of will, intensity, and power on something else, like
      trying to be a great scholar or an artist, that your life would be both
      wider and deeper, and altogether more productive?"
    

      We talked and when we came to speak of physical labour, I expressed this
      idea: that it was necessary that the strong should not enslave the weak,
      and that the minority should not be a parasite on the majority, always
      sucking up the finest sap, i. e., it was necessary that all without
      exception—the strong and the weak, the rich and the poor—should
      share equally in the struggle for existence, every man for himself, and in
      that respect there was no better means of levelling than physical labour
      and compulsory service for all.
    

      "You think, then," said the doctor, "that all, without, exception, should
      be employed in physical labour?"
    

      "Yes."
    

      "But don't you think that if everybody, including the best people,
      thinkers and men of science, were to take part in the struggle for
      existence, each man for himself, and took to breaking stones and painting
      roofs, it would be a serious menace to progress?"
    

      "Where is the danger?" I asked. "Progress consists in deeds of love, in
      the fulfilment of the moral law. If you enslave no one, and are a burden
      upon no one, what further progress do you want?"
    

      "But look here!" said Blagovo, suddenly losing his temper and getting up.
      "I say! If a snail in its shell is engaged in self-perfection in obedience
      to the moral law—would you call that progress?"
    

      "But why?" I was nettled. "If you make your neighbours feed you, clothe
      you, carry you, defend you from your enemies, their life is built up on
      slavery, and that is not progress. My view is that that is the most real
      and, perhaps, the only possible, the only progress necessary."
    

      "The limits of universal progress, which is common to all men, are in
      infinity, and it seems to me strange to talk of a 'possible' progress
      limited by our needs and temporal conceptions."
    

      "If the limits of peoples are in infinity, as you say, then it means that
      its goal is indefinite," I said. "Think of living without knowing
      definitely what for!"
    

      "Why not? Your 'not knowing' is not so boring as your 'knowing.' I am
      walking up a ladder which is called progress, civilisation, culture. I go
      on and on, not knowing definitely where I am going to, but surely it is
      worth while living for the sake of the wonderful ladder alone. And you
      know exactly what you are living for—that some should not enslave
      others, that the artist and the man who mixes his colours for him should
      dine together. But that is the bourgeois, kitchen side of life, and isn't
      it disgusting only to live for that? If some insects devour others, devil
      take them, let them! We need not think of them, they will perish and rot,
      however you save them from slavery—we must think of that great Cross
      which awaits all mankind in the distant future."
    

      Blagovo argued hotly with me, but it was noticeable that he was disturbed
      by some outside thought.
    

      "Your sister is not coming," he said, consulting his watch. "Yesterday she
      was at our house and said she was going to see you. You go on talking
      about slavery, slavery," he went on, "but it is a special question, and
      all these questions are solved by mankind gradually."
    

      We began to talk of evolution. I said that every man decides the question
      of good and evil for himself, and does not wait for mankind to solve the
      question by virtue of gradual development. Besides, evolution is a stick
      with two ends. Side by side with the gradual development of humanitarian
      ideas, there is the gradual growth of ideas of a different kind. Serfdom
      is past, and capitalism is growing. And with ideas of liberation at their
      height the majority, just as in the days of Baty, feeds, clothes, and
      defends the minority; and is left hungry, naked, and defenceless. The
      state of things harmonises beautifully with all your tendencies and
      movements, because the art of enslaving is also being gradually developed.
      We no longer flog our servants in the stables, but we give slavery more
      refined forms; at any rate, we are able to justify it in each separate
      case. Ideas remain ideas with us, but if we could, now, at the end of the
      nineteenth century, throw upon the working classes all our most unpleasant
      physiological functions, we should do so, and, of course, we should
      justify ourselves by saying that if the best people, thinkers and great
      scholars, had to waste their time on such functions, progress would be in
      serious jeopardy.
    

      Just then my sister entered. When she saw the doctor, she was flurried and
      excited, and at once began to say that it was time for her to go home to
      her father.
    

      "Cleopatra Alexeyevna," said Blagovo earnestly, laying his hands on his
      heart, "what will happen to your father if you spend half an hour with
      your brother and me?"
    

      He was a simple kind of man and could communicate his cheerfulness to
      others. My sister thought for a minute and began to laugh, and suddenly
      got very happy, suddenly, unexpectedly, just as she did at the picnic. We
      went out into the fields and lay on the grass, and went on with our
      conversation and looked at the town, where all the windows facing the west
      looked golden in the setting sun.
    

      After that Blagovo appeared every time my sister came to see me, and they
      always greeted each other as though their meeting was unexpected. My
      sister used to listen while the doctor and I argued, and her face was
      always joyful and rapturous, admiring and curious, and it seemed to me
      that a new world was slowly being discovered before her eyes, a world
      which she had not seen before even in her dreams, which now she was trying
      to divine; when the doctor was not there she was quiet and sad, and if, as
      she sat on my bed, she sometimes wept, it was for reasons of which she did
      not speak.
    

      In August Radish gave us orders to go to the railway. A couple of days
      before we were "driven" out of town, my father came to see me. He sat down
      and, without looking at me, slowly wiped his red face, then took out of
      his pocket our local paper and read out with deliberate emphasis on each
      word that a schoolfellow of my own age, the son of the director of the
      State Bank, had been appointed chief clerk of the Court of the Exchequer.
    

      "And now, look at yourself," he said, folding up the newspaper. "You are a
      beggar, a vagabond, a scoundrel! Even the bourgeoisie and other peasants
      get education to make themselves decent people, while you, a Pologniev,
      with famous, noble ancestors, go wallowing in the mire! But I did not come
      here to talk to you. I have given you up already." He went on in a choking
      voice, as he stood up: "I came here to find out where your sister is, you
      scoundrel! She left me after dinner. It is now past seven o'clock and she
      is not in. She has been going out lately without telling me, and she has
      been disrespectful—and I see your filthy, abominable influence at
      work. Where is she?"
    

      He had in his hands the familiar umbrella, and I was already taken aback,
      and I stood stiff and erect, like a schoolboy, waiting for my father to
      thrash me, but he saw the glance I cast at the umbrella and this probably
      checked him.
    

      "Live as you like!" he said. "My blessing is gone from you."
    

      "Good God!" muttered my old nurse behind the door. "You are lost. Oh! my
      heart feels some misfortune coming. I can feel it."
    

      I went to work on the railway. During the whole of August there was wind
      and rain. It was damp and cold; the corn had now been gathered in the
      fields, and on the big farms where the reaping was done with machines, the
      wheat lay not in stacks, but in heaps; and I remember how those melancholy
      heaps grew darker and darker every day, and the grain sprouted. It was
      hard work; the pouring rain spoiled everything that we succeeded in
      finishing. We were not allowed either to live or to sleep in the station
      buildings and had to take shelter in dirty, damp, mud huts where the
      "railies" had lived during the summer, and at night I could not sleep from
      the cold and the bugs crawling over my face and hands. And when we were
      working near the bridges, then the "railies" used to come out in a crowd
      to fight the painters—which they regarded as sport. They used to
      thrash us, steal our trousers, and to infuriate us and provoke us to a
      fight; they used to spoil our work, as when they smeared the signal-boxes
      with green paint. To add to all our miseries Radish began to pay us very
      irregularly. All the painting on the line was given to one contractor, who
      subcontracted with another, and he again with Radish, stipulating for
      twenty per cent commission. The job itself was unprofitable; then came the
      rains; time was wasted; we did no work and Radish had to pay his men every
      day. The starving painters nearly came to blows with him, called him a
      swindler, a bloodsucker, a Judas, and he, poor man, sighed and in despair
      raised his hands to the heavens and was continually going to Mrs.
      Cheprakov to borrow money.
    

      VII
    

      Came the rainy, muddy, dark autumn, bringing a slack time, and I used to
      sit at home three days in the week without work, or did various jobs
      outside painting; such as digging earth for ballast for twenty copecks a
      day. Doctor Blagovo had gone to Petersburg. My sister did not come to see
      me. Radish lay at home ill, expecting to die every day.
    

      And my mood was also autumnal; perhaps because when I became a working man
      I saw only the seamy side of the life of our town, and every day made
      fresh discoveries which brought me to despair. My fellow townsmen, both
      those of whom I had had a low opinion before, and those whom I had thought
      fairly decent, now seemed to me base, cruel, and up to any dirty trick. We
      poor people were tricked and cheated in the accounts, kept waiting for
      hours in cold passages or in the kitchen, and we were insulted and
      uncivilly treated. In the autumn I had to paper the library and two rooms
      at the club. I was paid seven copecks a piece, but was told to give a
      receipt for twelve copecks, and when I refused to do it, a respectable
      gentleman in gold spectacles, one of the stewards of the club, said to me:
    

      "If you say another word, you scoundrel, I'll knock you down."
    

      And when a servant whispered to him that I was the son of Pologniev, the
      architect, then I got flustered and blushed, but he recovered himself at
      once and said:
    

      "Damn him."
    

      In the shops we working men were sold bad meat, musty flour, and coarse
      tea. In church we were jostled by the police, and in the hospitals we were
      mulcted by the assistants and nurses, and if we could not give them bribes
      through poverty, we were given food in dirty dishes. In the post-office
      the lowest official considered it his duty to treat us as animals and to
      shout rudely and insolently: "Wait! Don't you come pushing your way in
      here!" Even the dogs, even they were hostile to us and hurled themselves
      at us with a peculiar malignancy. But what struck me most of all in my new
      position was the entire lack of justice, what the people call "forgetting
      God." Rarely a day went by without some swindle. The shopkeeper, who sold
      us oil, the contractor, the workmen, the customers themselves, all
      cheated. It was an understood thing that our rights were never considered,
      and we always had to pay for the money we had earned, going with our hats
      off to the back door.
    

      I was paper-hanging in one of the club-rooms, next the library, when, one
      evening as I was on the point of leaving, Dolyhikov's daughter came into
      the room carrying a bundle of books.
    

      I bowed to her.
    

      "Ah! How are you?" she said, recognising me at once and holding out her
      hand. "I am very glad to see you."
    

      She smiled and looked with a curious puzzled expression at my blouse and
      the pail of paste and the papers lying on the floor; I was embarrassed and
      she also felt awkward.
    

      "Excuse my staring at you," she said. "I have heard so much about you.
      Especially from Doctor Blagovo. He is enthusiastic about you. I have met
      your sister; she is a dear, sympathetic girl, but I could not make her see
      that there is nothing awful in your simple life. On the contrary, you are
      the most interesting man in the town."
    

      Once more she glanced at the pail of paste and the paper and said:
    

      "I asked Doctor Blagovo to bring us together, but he either forgot or had
      no time. However, we have met now. I should be very pleased if you would
      call on me. I do so want to have a talk. I am a simple person," she said,
      holding out her hand, "and I hope you will come and see me without
      ceremony. My father is away, in Petersburg."
    

      She went into the reading-room, with her dress rustling, and for a long
      time after I got home I could not sleep.
    

      During that autumn some kind soul, wishing to relieve my existence, sent
      me from time to time presents of tea and lemons, or biscuits, or roast
      pigeons. Karpovna said the presents were brought by a soldier, though from
      whom she did not know; and the soldier used to ask if I was well, if I had
      dinner every day, and if I had warm clothes. When the frost began the
      soldier came while I was out and brought a soft knitted scarf, which gave
      out a soft, hardly perceptible scent, and I guessed who my good fairy had
      been. For the scarf smelled of lily-of-the-valley, Aniuta Blagovo's
      favourite scent.
    

      Toward winter there was more work and things became more cheerful. Radish
      came to life again and we worked together in the cemetery church, where we
      scraped the holy shrine for gilding. It was a clean, quiet, and, as our
      mates said, a specially good job. We could do a great deal in one day, and
      so time passed quickly, imperceptibly. There was no swearing, nor
      laughing, nor loud altercations. The place compelled quiet and decency,
      and disposed one for tranquil, serious thoughts. Absorbed in our work, we
      stood or sat immovably, like statues; there was a dead silence, very
      proper to a cemetery, so that if a tool fell down, or the oil in the lamp
      spluttered, the sound would be loud and startling, and we would turn to
      see what it was. After a long silence one could hear a humming like that
      of a swarm of bees; in the porch, in an undertone, the funeral service was
      being read over a dead baby; or a painter painting a moon surrounded with
      stars on the cupola would begin to whistle quietly, and remembering
      suddenly that he was in a church, would stop; or Radish would sigh at his
      own thoughts: "Anything may happen! Anything may happen!" or above our
      heads there would be the slow, mournful tolling of a bell, and the
      painters would say it must be a rich man being brought to the church....
    

      The days I spent in the peace of the little church, and during the
      evenings I played billiards, or went to the gallery of the theatre in the
      new serge suit I had bought with my own hard-earned money. They were
      already beginning plays and concerts at the Azhoguins', and Radish did the
      scenery by himself. He told me about the plays and tableaux vivants at the
      Azhoguins', and I listened to him enviously. I had a great longing to take
      part in the rehearsals, but I dared not go to the Azhoguins'.
    

      A week before Christmas Doctor Blagovo arrived, and we resumed our
      arguments and played billiards in the evenings. When he played billiards
      he used to take off his coat, and unfasten his shirt at the neck, and
      generally try to look like a debauchee. He drank a little, but rowdily,
      and managed to spend in a cheap tavern like the Volga as much as twenty
      roubles in an evening.
    

      Once more my sister came to see me, and when they met they expressed
      surprise, but I could see by her happy, guilty face that these meetings
      were not accidental. One evening when we were playing billiards the doctor
      said to me:
    

      "I say, why don't you call on Miss Dolyhikov? You don't know Maria
      Victorovna. She is a clever, charming, simple creature."
    

      I told him how the engineer had received me in the spring.
    

      "Nonsense!" laughed the doctor. "The engineer is one thing and she is
      another. Really, my good fellow, you mustn't offend her. Go and see her
      some time. Let us go to-morrow evening. Will you?"
    

      He persuaded me. Next evening I donned my serge suit and with some
      perturbation set out to call on Miss Dolyhikov. The footman did not seem
      to me so haughty and formidable, or the furniture so oppressive, as on the
      morning when I had come to ask for work. Maria Victorovna was expecting me
      and greeted me as an old friend and gave my hand a warm, friendly grip.
      She was wearing a grey dress with wide sleeves, and had her hair done in
      the style which when it became the fashion a year later in our town, was
      called "dog's ears." The hair was combed back over the ears, and it made
      Maria Victorovna's face look broader, and she looked very like her father,
      whose face was broad and red and rather like a coachman's. She was
      handsome and elegant, but not young; about thirty to judge by her
      appearance, though she was not more than twenty-five.
    

      "Dear doctor!" she said, making me sit down. "How grateful I am to him.
      But for him, you would not have come. I am bored to death! My father has
      gone and left me alone, and I do not know what to do with myself."
    

      Then she began to ask where I was working, how much I got, and where I
      lived.
    

      "Do you only spend what you earn on yourself?" she asked.
    

      "Yes."
    

      "You are a happy man," she replied. "All the evil in life, it seems to me,
      comes from boredom and idleness, and spiritual emptiness, which are
      inevitable when one lives at other people's expense. Don't think I'm
      showing off. I mean it sincerely. It is dull and unpleasant to be rich.
      Win friends by just riches, they say, because as a rule there is and can
      be no such thing as just riches."
    

      She looked at the furniture with a serious, cold expression, as though she
      was making an inventory of it, and went on:
    

      "Ease and comfort possess a magic power. Little by little they seduce even
      strong-willed people. Father and I used to live poorly and simply, and now
      you see how we live. Isn't it strange?" she said with a shrug. "We spend
      twenty thousand roubles a year! In the provinces!"
    

      "Ease and comfort must not be regarded as the inevitable privilege of
      capital and education," I said. "It seems to me possible to unite the
      comforts of life with work, however hard and dirty it may be. Your father
      is rich, but, as he says, he used to be a mechanic, and just a
      lubricator."
    

      She smiled and shook her head thoughtfully.
    

      "Papa sometimes eats tiurya," she said, "but only out of caprice."
    

      A bell rang and she got up.
    

      "The rich and the educated ought to work like the rest," she went on, "and
      if there is to be any comfort, it should be accessible to all. There
      should be no privileges. However, that's enough philosophy. Tell me
      something cheerful. Tell me about the painters. What are they like?
      Funny?"
    

      The doctor came. I began to talk about the painters, but, being unused to
      it, I felt awkward and talked solemnly and ponderously like an
      ethnographist. The doctor also told a few stories about working people. He
      rocked to and fro and cried, and fell on his knees, and when he was
      depicting a drunkard, lay flat on the floor. It was as good as a play, and
      Maria Victorovna laughed until she cried. Then he played the piano and
      sang in his high-pitched tenor, and Maria Victorovna stood by him and told
      him what to sing and corrected him when he made a mistake.
    

      "I hear you sing, too," said I.
    

      "Too?" cried the doctor. "She is a wonderful singer, an artist, and you
      say—too! Careful, careful!"
    

      "I used to study seriously," she replied, "but I have given it up now."
    

      She sat on a low stool and told us about her life in Petersburg, and
      imitated famous singers, mimicking their voices and mannerisms; then she
      sketched the doctor and myself in her album, not very well, but both were
      good likenesses. She laughed and made jokes and funny faces, and this
      suited her better than talking about unjust riches, and it seemed to me
      that what she had said about "riches and comfort" came not from herself,
      but was just mimicry. She was an admirable comedian. I compared her
      mentally with the girls of our town, and not even the beautiful, serious
      Aniuta Blagovo could stand up against her; the difference was as vast as
      that between a wild and a garden rose.
    

      We stayed to supper. The doctor and Maria Victorovna drank red wine,
      champagne, and coffee with cognac; they touched glasses and drank to
      friendship, to wit, to progress, to freedom, and never got drunk, but went
      rather red and laughed for no reason until they cried. To avoid being out
      of it I, too, drank red wine.
    

      "People with talent and with gifted natures," said Miss Dolyhikov, "know
      how to live and go their own way; but ordinary people like myself know
      nothing and can do nothing by themselves; there is nothing for them but to
      find some deep social current and let themselves be borne along by it."
    

      "Is it possible to find that which does not exist?" asked the doctor.
    

      "It doesn't exist because we don't see it."
    

      "Is that so? Social currents are the invention of modern literature. They
      don't exist here."
    

      A discussion began.
    

      "We have no profound social movements; nor have we had them," said the
      doctor. "Modern literature has invented a lot of things, and modern
      literature invented intellectual working men in village life, but go
      through all our villages and you will only find Mr. Cheeky Snout in a
      jacket or black frock coat, who will make four mistakes in the word 'one.'
      Civilised life has not begun with us yet. We have the same savagery, the
      same slavery, the same nullity as we had five hundred years ago.
      Movements, currents—all that is so wretched and puerile mixed up
      with such vulgar, catch-penny interests—and one cannot take it
      seriously. You may think you have discovered a large social movement, and
      you may follow it and devote your life in the modern fashion to such
      problems as the liberation of vermin from slavery, or the abolition of
      meat cutlets—and I congratulate you, madam. But we have to learn,
      learn, learn, and there will be plenty of time for social movements; we
      are not up to them yet, and upon my soul, we don't understand anything at
      all about them."
    

      "You don't understand, but I do," said Maria Victorovna. "Good Heavens!
      What a bore you are to-night."
    

      "It is our business to learn and learn, to try and accumulate as much
      knowledge as possible, because serious social movements come where there
      is knowledge, and the future happiness of mankind lies in science. Here's
      to science!"
    

      "One thing is certain. Life must somehow be arranged differently," said
      Maria Victorovna, after some silence and deep thought, "and life as it has
      been up to now is worthless. Don't let us talk about it."
    

      When we left her the Cathedral clock struck two.
    

      "Did you like her?" asked the doctor. "Isn't she a dear girl?"
    

      We had dinner at Maria Victorovna's on Christmas Day, and then we went to
      see her every day during the holidays. There was nobody besides ourselves,
      and she was right when she said she had no friends in the town but the
      doctor and me. We spent most of the time talking, and sometimes the doctor
      would bring a book or a magazine and read aloud. After all, he was the
      first cultivated man I had met. I could not tell if he knew much, but he
      was always generous with his knowledge because he wished others to know
      too. When he talked about medicine, he was not like any of our local
      doctors, but he made a new and singular impression, and it seemed to me
      that if he had wished he could have become a genuine scientist. And
      perhaps he was the only person at that time who had any real influence
      over me. Meeting him and reading the books he gave me, I began gradually
      to feel a need for knowledge to inspire the tedium of my work. It seemed
      strange to me that I had not known before such things as that the whole
      world consisted of sixty elements. I did not know what oil or paint was,
      and I could do without knowing. My acquaintance with the doctor raised me
      morally too. I used to argue with him, and though I usually stuck to my
      opinion, yet, through him, I came gradually to perceive that everything
      was not clear to me, and I tried to cultivate convictions as definite as
      possible so that the promptings of my conscience should be precise and
      have nothing vague about them. Nevertheless, educated and fine as he was,
      far and away the best man in the town, he was by no means perfect. There
      was something rather rude and priggish in his ways and in his trick of
      dragging talk down to discussion, and when he took off his coat and sat in
      his shirt and gave the footman a tip, it always seemed to me that culture
      was just a part of him, with the rest untamed Tartar.
    

      After the holidays he left once more for Petersburg. He went in the
      morning and after dinner my sister came to see me. Without taking off her
      furs, she sat silent, very pale, staring in front of her. She began to
      shiver and seemed to be fighting against some illness.
    

      "You must have caught a cold," I said.
    

      Her eyes filled with tears. She rose and went to Karpovna without a word
      to me, as though I had offended her. And a little later I heard her
      speaking in a tone of bitter reproach.
    

      "Nurse, what have I been living for, up to now? What for? Tell me; haven't
      I wasted my youth? During the last years I have had nothing but making up
      accounts, pouring out tea, counting the copecks, entertaining guests,
      without a thought that there was anything better in the world! Nurse, try
      to understand me, I too have human desires and I want to live and they
      have made a housekeeper of me. It is awful, awful!"
    

      She flung her keys against the door and they fell with a clatter in my
      room. They were the keys of the side-board, the larder, the cellar, and
      the tea-chest—the keys my mother used to carry.
    

      "Oh! Oh! Saints above!" cried my old nurse in terror. "The blessed
      saints!"
    

      When she left, my sister came into my room for her keys and said:
    

      "Forgive me. Something strange has been going on in me lately."
    

      VIII
    

      One evening when I came home late from Maria Victorovna's I found a young
      policeman in a new uniform in my room; he was sitting by the table
      reading.
    

      "At last!" he said getting up and stretching himself. "This is the third
      time I have been to see you. The governor has ordered you to go and see
      him to-morrow at nine o'clock sharp. Don't be late."
    

      He made me give him a written promise to comply with his Excellency's
      orders and went away. This policeman's visit and the unexpected invitation
      to see the governor had a most depressing effect on me. From my early
      childhood I have had a dread of gendarmes, police, legal officials, and I
      was tormented with anxiety as though I had really committed a crime and I
      could not sleep. Nurse and Prokofyi were also upset and could not sleep.
      And, to make things worse, nurse had an earache, and moaned and more than
      once screamed out. Hearing that I could not sleep Prokofyi came quietly
      into my room with a little lamp and sat by the table.
    

      "You should have a drop of pepper-brandy...." he said after some thought.
      "In this vale of tears things go on all right when you take a drop. And if
      mother had some pepper-brandy poured into her ear she would be much
      better."
    

      About three he got ready to go to the slaughter-house to fetch some meat.
      I knew I should not sleep until morning, and to use up the time until
      nine, I went with him. We walked with a lantern, and his boy, Nicolka, who
      was about thirteen, and had blue spots on his face and an expression like
      a murderer's, drove behind us in a sledge, urging the horse on with hoarse
      cries.
    

      "You will probably be punished at the governor's," said Prokofyi as we
      walked. "There is a governor's rank, and an archimandrite's rank, and an
      officer's rank, and a doctor's rank, and every profession has its own
      rank. You don't keep to yours and they won't allow it."
    

      The slaughter-house stood behind the cemetery, and till then I had only
      seen it at a distance. It consisted of three dark sheds surrounded by a
      grey fence, from which, when the wind was in that direction in summer,
      there came an overpowering stench. Now, as I entered the yard, I could not
      see the sheds in the darkness; I groped through horses and sledges, both
      empty and laden with meat; and there were men walking about with lanterns
      and swearing disgustingly. Prokofyi and Nicolka swore as filthily and
      there was a continuous hum from the swearing and coughing and the neighing
      of the horses.
    

      The place smelled of corpses and offal, the snow was thawing and already
      mixed with mud, and in the darkness it seemed to me that I was walking
      through a pool of blood.
    

      When we had filled the sledge with meat, we went to the butcher's shop in
      the market-place. Day was beginning to dawn. One after another the cooks
      came with baskets and old women in mantles. With an axe in his hand,
      wearing a white, blood-stained apron, Prokofyi swore terrifically and
      crossed himself, turning toward the church, and shouted so loud that he
      could be heard all over the market, avowing that he sold his meat at cost
      price and even at a loss. He cheated in weighing and reckoning, the cooks
      saw it, but, dazed by his shouting, they did not protest, but only called
      him a gallows-bird.
    

      Raising and dropping his formidable axe, he assumed picturesque attitudes
      and constantly uttered the sound "Hak!" with a furious expression, and I
      was really afraid of his cutting off some one's head or hand.
    

      I stayed in the butcher's shop the whole morning, and when at last I went
      to the governor's my fur coat smelled of meat and blood. My state of mind
      would have been appropriate for an encounter with a bear armed with no
      more than a staff. I remember a long staircase with a striped carpet, and
      a young official in a frock coat with shining buttons, who silently
      indicated the door with both hands and went in to announce me. I entered
      the hall, where the furniture was most luxurious, but cold and tasteless,
      forming a most unpleasant impression—the tall, narrow pier-glasses,
      and the bright, yellow hangings over the windows; one could see that,
      though governors changed, the furniture remained the same. The young
      official again pointed with both hands to the door and went toward a
      large, green table, by which stood a general with the Order of Vladimir at
      his neck.
    

      "Mr. Pologniev," he began, holding a letter in his hand and opening his
      mouth wide so that it made a round O. "I asked you to come to say this to
      you: 'Your esteemed father has applied verbally and in writing to the
      provincial marshal of nobility, to have you summoned and made to see the
      incongruity of your conduct with the title of nobleman which you have the
      honour to bear. His Excellency Alexander Pavlovich, justly thinking that
      your conduct may be subversive, and finding that persuasion may not be
      sufficient, without serious intervention on the part of the authorities,
      has given me his decision as to your case, and I agree with him.'"
    

      He said this quietly, respectfully, standing erect as if I was his
      superior, and his expression was not at all severe. He had a flabby, tired
      face, covered with wrinkles, with pouches under his eyes; his hair was
      dyed, and it was hard to guess his age from his appearance—fifty or
      sixty.
    

      "I hope," he went on, "that you will appreciate Alexander Pavlovich's
      delicacy in applying to me, not officially, but privately. I have invited
      you unofficially not as a governor, but as a sincere admirer of your
      father's. And I ask you to change your conduct and to return to the duties
      proper to your rank, or, to avoid the evil effects of your example, to go
      to some other place where you are not known and where you may do what you
      like. Otherwise I shall have to resort to extreme measures."
    

      For half a minute he stood in silence staring at me open-mouthed.
    

      "Are you a vegetarian?" he asked.
    

      "No, your Excellency, I eat meat."
    

      He sat down and took up a document, and I bowed and left.
    

      It was not worth while going to work before dinner. I went home and tried
      to sleep, but could not because of the unpleasant, sickly feeling from the
      slaughter-house and my conversation with the governor. And so I dragged
      through till the evening and then, feeling gloomy and out of sorts, I went
      to see Maria Victorovna. I told her about my visit to the governor and she
      looked at me in bewilderment, as if she did not believe me, and suddenly
      she began to laugh merrily, heartily, stridently, as only good-natured,
      light-hearted people can.
    

      "If I were to tell this in Petersburg!" she cried, nearly dropping with
      laughter, bending over the table. "If I could tell them in Petersburg!"
    

      IX
    

      Now we saw each other often, sometimes twice a day. Almost every day,
      after dinner, she drove up to the cemetery and, as she waited for me, read
      the inscriptions on the crosses and monuments. Sometimes she came into the
      church and stood by my side and watched me working. The silence, the
      simple industry of the painters and gilders, Radish's good sense, and the
      fact that outwardly I was no different from the other artisans and worked
      as they did, in a waistcoat and old shoes, and that they addressed me
      familiarly—were new to her, and she was moved by it all. Once in her
      presence a painter who was working, at a door on the roof, called down to
      me:
    

      "Misail, fetch me the white lead."
    

      I fetched him the white lead and as I came down the scaffolding she was
      moved to tears and looked at me and smiled:
    

      "What a dear you are!" she said.
    

      I have always remembered how when I was a child a green parrot got out of
      its cage in one of the rich people's houses and wandered about the town
      for a whole month, flying from one garden to another, homeless and lonely.
      And Maria Victorovna reminded me of the bird.
    

      "Except to the cemetery," she said with a laugh, "I have absolutely
      nowhere to go. The town bores me to tears. People read, sing, and twitter
      at the Azhoguins', but I cannot bear them lately. Your sister is shy, Miss
      Blagovo for some reason hates me. I don't like the theatre. What can I do
      with myself?"
    

      When I was at her house I smelled of paint and turpentine, and my hands
      were stained. She liked that. She wanted me to come to her in my ordinary
      working-clothes; but I felt awkward in them in her drawing-room, and as if
      I were in uniform, and so I always wore my new serge suit. She did not
      like that.
    

      "You must confess," she said once, "that you have not got used to your new
      rôle. A working-man's suit makes you feel awkward and embarrassed.
      Tell me, isn't it because you are not sure of yourself and are
      unsatisfied? Does this work you have chosen, this painting of yours,
      really satisfy you?" she asked merrily. "I know paint makes things look
      nicer and wear better, but the things themselves belong to the rich and
      after all they are a luxury. Besides you have said more than once that
      everybody should earn his living with his own hands and you earn money,
      not bread. Why don't you keep to the exact meaning of what you say? You
      must earn bread, real bread, you must plough, sow, reap, thrash, or do
      something which has to do directly with agriculture, such as keeping cows,
      digging, or building houses...."
    

      She opened a handsome bookcase which stood by the writing-table and said:
    

      "I'm telling you all this because I'm going to let you into my secret.
      Voilà. This is my agricultural library. Here are books on arable
      land, vegetable-gardens, orchard-keeping, cattle-keeping, bee-keeping: I
      read them eagerly and have studied the theory of everything thoroughly. It
      is my dream to go to Dubechnia as soon as March begins. It is wonderful
      there, amazing; isn't it? The first year I shall only be learning the work
      and getting used to it, and in the second year I shall begin to work
      thoroughly, without sparing myself. My father promised to give me
      Dubechnia as a present, and I am to do anything I like with it."
    

      She blushed and with mingled laughter and tears she dreamed aloud of her
      life at Dubechnia and how absorbing it would be. And I envied her. March
      would soon be here. The days were drawing out, and in the bright sunny
      afternoons the snow dripped from the roofs, and the smell of spring was in
      the air. I too longed for the country.
    

      And when she said she was going to live at Dubechnia, I saw at once that I
      should be left alone in the town, and I felt jealous of the bookcase with
      her books about farming. I knew and cared nothing about farming and I was
      on the point of telling her that agriculture was work for slaves, but I
      recollected that my father had once said something of the sort and I held
      my peace.
    

      Lent began. The engineer, Victor Ivanich, came home from Petersburg. I had
      begun to forget his existence. He came unexpectedly, not even sending a
      telegram. When I went there as usual in the evening, he was walking up and
      down the drawing-room, after a bath, with his hair cut, looking ten years
      younger, and talking. His daughter was kneeling by his trunks and taking
      out boxes, bottles, books, and handing them to Pavel the footman. When I
      saw the engineer, I involuntarily stepped back and he held out both his
      hands and smiled and showed his strong, white, cab-driver's teeth.
    

      "Here he is! Here he is! I'm very pleased to see you, Mr. House-painter!
      Maria told me all about you and sang your praises. I quite understand you
      and heartily approve." He took me by the arm and went on: "It is much
      cleverer and more honest to be a decent workman than to spoil State paper
      and to wear a cockade. I myself worked with my hands in Belgium. I was an
      engine-driver for five years...."
    

      He was wearing a short jacket and comfortable slippers, and he shuffled
      along like a gouty man waving and rubbing his hands; humming and buzzing
      and shrugging with pleasure at being at home again with his favourite
      shower-bath.
    

      "There's no denying," he said at supper, "there's no denying that you are
      kind, sympathetic people, but somehow as soon as you gentlefolk take on
      manual labour or try to spare the peasants, you reduce it all to
      sectarianism. You are a sectarian. You don't drink vodka. What is that but
      sectarianism?"
    

      To please him I drank vodka. I drank wine, too. We ate cheese, sausages,
      pastries, pickles, and all kinds of dainties that the engineer had brought
      with him, and we sampled wines sent from abroad during his absence. They
      were excellent. For some reason the engineer had wines and cigars sent
      from abroad—duty free; somebody sent him caviare and baliki
      gratis; he did not pay rent for his house because his landlord supplied
      the railway with kerosene, and generally he and his daughter gave me the
      impression of having all the best things in the world at their service
      free of charge.
    

      I went on visiting them, but with less pleasure than before. The engineer
      oppressed me and I felt cramped in his presence. I could not endure his
      clear, innocent eyes; his opinions bored me and were offensive to me, and
      I was distressed by the recollection that I had so recently been
      subordinate to this ruddy, well-fed man, and that he had been mercilessly
      rude to me. True he would put his arm round my waist and clap me kindly on
      the shoulder and approve of my way of living, but I felt that he despised
      my nullity just as much as before and only suffered me to please his
      daughter, but I could no longer laugh and talk easily, and I thought
      myself ill-mannered, and all the time was expecting him to call me
      Panteley as he did his footman Pavel. How my provincial, bourgeois pride
      rode up against him! I, a working man, a painter, going every day to the
      house of rich strangers, whom the whole town regarded as foreigners, and
      drinking their expensive wines and outlandish dishes! I could not
      reconcile this with my conscience. When I went to see them I sternly
      avoided those whom I met on the way, and looked askance at them like a
      real sectarian, and when I left the engineer's house I was ashamed of
      feeling so well-fed.
    

      But chiefly I was afraid of falling in love. Whether walking in the
      street, or working, or talking to my mates, I thought all the time of
      going to Maria Victorovna's in the evening, and always had her voice, her
      laughter, her movements with me. And always as I got ready to go to her, I
      would stand for a long time in front of the cracked mirror tying my
      necktie; my serge suit seemed horrible to me, and I suffered, but at the
      same time, despised myself for feeling so small. When she called to me
      from another room to say that she was not dressed yet and to ask me to
      wait a bit, and I could hear her dressing, I was agitated and felt as
      though the floor was sinking under me. And when I saw a woman in the
      street, even at a distance, I fell to comparing her figure with hers, and
      it seemed to me that all our women and girls were vulgar, absurdly
      dressed, and without manners; and such comparisons roused in me a feeling
      of pride; Maria Victorovna was better than all of them. And at night I
      dreamed of her and myself.
    

      Once at supper the engineer and I ate a whole lobster. When I reached home
      I remember that the engineer had twice called me "my dear fellow," and I
      thought that they treated me as they might have done a big, unhappy dog,
      separated from his master, and that they were amusing themselves with me,
      and that they would order me away like a dog when they were bored with me.
      I began to feel ashamed and hurt; went to the point of tears, as though I
      had been insulted, and, raising my eyes to the heavens, I vowed to put an
      end to it all.
    

      Next day I did not go to the Dolyhikovs'. Late at night, when it was quite
      dark and pouring with rain, I walked up and down Great Gentry Street,
      looking at the windows. At the Azhoguins' everybody was asleep and the
      only light was in one of the top windows; old Mrs. Azhoguin was sitting in
      her room embroidering by candle-light and imagining herself to be fighting
      against prejudice. It was dark in our house and opposite, at the
      Dolyhikovs' the windows were lit up, but it was impossible to see anything
      through the flowers and curtains. I kept on walking up and down the
      street; I was soaked through with the cold March rain. I heard my father
      come home from the club; he knocked at the door; in a minute a light
      appeared at a window and I saw my sister walking quickly with her lamp and
      hurriedly arranging her thick hair. Then my father paced up and down the
      drawing-room, talking and rubbing his hands, and my sister sat still in a
      corner, lost in thought, not listening to him....
    

      But soon they left the room and the light was put out.... I looked at the
      engineer's house and that too was now dark. In the darkness and the rain I
      felt desperately lonely. Cast out at the mercy of Fate, and I felt how,
      compared with my loneliness, and my suffering, actual and to come, all my
      work and all my desires and all that I had hitherto thought and read, were
      vain and futile. Alas! The activities and thoughts of human beings are not
      nearly so important as their sorrows! And not knowing exactly what I was
      doing I pulled with all my might at the bell at the Dolyhikovs' gate,
      broke it, and ran away down the street like a little boy, full of fear,
      thinking they would rush out at once and recognise me. When I stopped to
      take breath at the end of the street, I could hear nothing but the falling
      rain and far away a night-watchman knocking on a sheet of iron.
    

      For a whole week I did not go to the Dolyhikovs'. I sold my serge suit. I
      had no work and I was once more half-starved, earning ten or twenty
      copecks a day, when possible, by disagreeable work. Floundering knee-deep
      in the mire, putting out all my strength, I tried to drown my memories and
      to punish myself for all the cheeses and pickles to which I had been
      treated at the engineer's. Still, no sooner did I go to bed, wet and
      hungry, than my untamed imagination set to work to evolve wonderful,
      alluring pictures, and to my amazement I confessed that I was in love,
      passionately in love, and I fell sound asleep feeling that the hard life
      had only made my body stronger and younger.
    

      One evening it began, most unseasonably, to snow, and the wind blew from
      the north, exactly as if winter had begun again. When I got home from work
      I found Maria Victorovna in my room. She was in her furs with her hands in
      her muff.
    

      "Why don't you come to see me?" she asked, looking at me with her bright
      sagacious eyes, and I was overcome with joy and stood stiffly in front of
      her, just as I had done with my father when he was going to thrash me; she
      looked straight into my face and I could see by her eyes that she
      understood why I was overcome.
    

      "Why don't you come to see me?" she repeated. "You don't want to come? I
      had to come to you."
    

      She got up and came close to me.
    

      "Don't leave me," she said, and her eyes filled with tears. "I am lonely,
      utterly lonely."
    

      She began to cry and said, covering her face with her muff:
    

      "Alone! Life is hard, very hard, and in the whole world I have no one but
      you. Don't leave me!"
    

      Looking for her handkerchief to dry her tears, she gave a smile; we were
      silent for some time, then I embraced and kissed her, and the pin in her
      hat scratched my face and drew blood.
    

      And we began to talk as though we had been dear to each other for a long,
      long time.
    

      X
    

      In a couple of days she sent me to Dubechnia and I was beyond words
      delighted with it. As I walked to the station, and as I sat in the train,
      I laughed for no reason and people thought me drunk. There were snow and
      frost in the mornings still, but the roads were getting dark, and there
      were rooks cawing above them.
    

      At first I thought of arranging the side wing opposite Mrs. Cheprakov's
      for myself and Masha, but it appeared that doves and pigeons had taken up
      their abode there and it would be impossible to cleanse it without
      destroying a great number of nests. We would have to live willy-nilly in
      the uncomfortable rooms with Venetian blinds in the big house. The
      peasants called it a palace; there were more than twenty rooms in it, and
      the only furniture was a piano and a child's chair, lying in the attic,
      and even if Masha brought all her furniture from town we should not
      succeed in removing the impression of frigid emptiness and coldness. I
      chose three small rooms with windows looking on to the garden, and from
      early morning till late at night I was at work in them, glazing the
      windows, hanging paper, blocking up the chinks and holes in the floor. It
      was an easy, pleasant job. Every now and then I would run to the river to
      see if the ice was breaking and all the while I dreamed of the starlings
      returning. And at night when I thought of Masha I would be filled with an
      inexpressibly sweet feeling of an all-embracing joy to listen to the rats
      and the wind rattling and knocking above the ceiling; it was like an old
      hobgoblin coughing in the attic.
    

      The snow was deep; there was a heavy fall at the end of March, but it
      thawed rapidly, as if by magic, and the spring floods rushed down so that
      by the beginning of April the starlings were already chattering and yellow
      butterflies fluttered in the garden. The weather was wonderful. Every day
      toward evening I walked toward the town to meet Masha, and how delightful
      it was to walk along the soft, drying road with bare feet! Half-way I
      would sit down and look at the town, not daring to go nearer. The sight of
      it upset me, I was always wondering how my acquaintances would behave
      toward me when they heard of my love. What would my father say? I was
      particularly worried by the idea that my life was becoming more
      complicated, and that I had entirely lost control of it, and that she was
      carrying me off like a balloon, God knows whither. I had already given up
      thinking how to make a living, and I thought—indeed, I cannot
      remember what I thought.
    

      Masha used to come in a carriage. I would take a seat beside her and
      together, happy and free, we used to drive to Dubechnia. Or, having waited
      till sunset, I would return home, weary and disconsolate, wondering why
      Masha had not come, and then by the gate or in the garden I would find my
      darling. She would come by the railway and walk over from the station.
      What a triumph she had then! In her plain, woollen dress, with a simple
      umbrella, but keeping a trim, fashionable figure and expensive, Parisian
      boots—she was a gifted actress playing the country girl. We used to
      go over the house, and plan out the rooms, and the paths, and the
      vegetable-garden, and the beehives. We already had chickens and ducks and
      geese which we loved because they were ours. We had oats, clover,
      buckwheat, and vegetable seeds all ready for sowing, and we used to
      examine them all and wonder what the crops would be like, and everything
      Masha said to me seemed extraordinarily clever and fine. This was the
      happiest time of my life.
    

      Soon after Easter we were married in the parish church in the village of
      Kurilovka three miles from Dubechnia. Masha wanted everything to be
      simple; by her wish our bridesmen were peasant boys, only one deacon sang,
      and we returned from the church in a little, shaky cart which she drove
      herself. My sister was the only guest from the town. Masha had sent her a
      note a couple of days before the wedding. My sister wore a white dress and
      white gloves.... During the ceremony she cried softly for joy and emotion,
      and her face had a maternal expression of infinite goodness. She was
      intoxicated with our happiness and smiled as though she were breathing a
      sweet perfume, and when I looked at her I understood that there was
      nothing in the world higher in her eyes than love, earthly love, and that
      she was always dreaming of love, secretly, timidly, yet passionately. She
      embraced Masha and kissed her, and, not knowing how to express her
      ecstasy, she said to her of me:
    

      "He is a good man! A very good man."
    

      Before she left us, she put on her ordinary clothes, and took me into the
      garden to have a quiet talk.
    

      "Father is very hurt that you have not written to him," she said. "You
      should have asked for his blessing. But, at heart, he is very pleased. He
      says that this marriage will raise you in the eyes of society, and that
      under Maria Victorovna's influence you will begin to adopt a more serious
      attitude toward life. In the evening now we talk about nothing but you;
      and yesterday he even said, 'our Misail.' I was delighted. He has
      evidently thought of a plan and I believe he wants to set you an example
      of magnanimity, and that he will be the first to talk of reconciliation.
      It is quite possible that one of these days he will come and see you
      here."
    

      She made the sign of the cross over me and said:
    

      "Well, God bless you. Be happy. Aniuta Blagovo is a very clever girl. She
      says of your marriage that God has sent you a new ordeal. Well? Married
      life is not made up only of joy but of suffering as well. It is impossible
      to avoid it."
    

      Masha and I walked about three miles with her, and then walked home
      quietly and silently, as though it were a rest for both of us. Masha had
      her hand on my arm. We were at peace and there was no need to talk of
      love; after the wedding we grew closer to each other and dearer, and it
      seemed as though nothing could part us.
    

      "Your sister is a dear, lovable creature," said Masha, "but looks as
      though she had lived in torture. Your father must be a terrible man."
    

      I began to tell her how my sister and I had been brought up and how absurd
      and full of torture our childhood had been. When she heard that my father
      had thrashed me quite recently she shuddered and clung to me:
    

      "Don't tell me any more," she said. "It is too horrible."
    

      And now she did not leave me. We lived in the big house, in three rooms,
      and in the evenings we bolted the door that led to the empty part of the
      house, as though some one lived there whom we did not know and feared. I
      used to get up early, at dawn, and begin working. I repaired the carts;
      made paths in the garden, dug the beds, painted the roofs. When the time
      came to sow oats, I tried to plough and harrow, and sow and did it all
      conscientiously, and did not leave it all to the labourer. I used to get
      tired, and my face and feet used to burn with the rain and the sharp cold
      wind. But work in the fields did not attract me. I knew nothing about
      agriculture and did not like it; perhaps because my ancestors were not
      tillers of the soil and pure town blood ran in my veins. I loved nature
      dearly; I loved the fields and the meadows and the garden, but the peasant
      who turns the earth with his plough, shouting at his miserable horse,
      ragged and wet, with bowed shoulders, was to me an expression of wild,
      rude, ugly force, and as I watched his clumsy movements I could not help
      thinking of the long-passed legendary life, when men did not yet know the
      use of fire. The fierce bull which led the herd, and the horses that
      stampeded through the village, filled me with terror, and all the large
      creatures, strong and hostile, a ram with horns, a gander, or a watch-dog
      seemed to me to be symbolical of some rough, wild force. These prejudices
      used to be particularly strong in me in bad weather, when heavy clouds
      hung over the black plough-lands. But worst of all was that when I was
      ploughing or sowing, and a few peasants stood and watched how I did it, I
      no longer felt the inevitability and necessity of the work and it seemed
      to me that I was trifling my time away.
    

      I used to go through the gardens and the meadow to the mill. It was leased
      by Stiepan, a Kurilovka peasant; handsome, swarthy, with a black beard—an
      athletic appearance. He did not care for mill work and thought it tiresome
      and unprofitable, and he only lived at the mill to escape from home. He
      was a saddler and always smelled of tan and leather. He did not like
      talking, was slow and immovable, and used to hum "U-lu-lu-lu," sitting on
      the bank or in the doorway of the mill. Sometimes his wife and
      mother-in-law used to come from Kurilovka to see him; they were both fair,
      languid, soft, and they used to bow to him humbly and call him Stiepan
      Petrovich. And he would not answer their greeting with a word or a sign,
      but would turn where he sat on the bank and hum quietly: "U-lu-lu-lu."
      There would be a silence for an hour or two. His mother-in-law and his
      wife would whisper to each other, get up and look expectantly at him for
      some time, waiting for him to look at them, and then they would bow humbly
      and say in sweet, soft voices:
    

      "Good-bye, Stiepan Petrovich."
    

      And they would go away. After that, Stiepan would put away the bundle of
      cracknels or the shirt they had left for him and sigh and give a wink in
      their direction and say:
    

      "The female sex!"
    

      The mill was worked with both wheels day and night. I used to help
      Stiepan, I liked it, and when he went away I was glad to take his place.
    

      XI
    

      After a spell of warm bright weather we had a season of bad roads. It
      rained and was cold all through May. The grinding of the millstones and
      the drip of the rain induced idleness and sleep. The floor shook, the
      whole place smelled of flour, and this too made one drowsy. My wife in a
      short fur coat and high rubber boots used to appear twice a day and she
      always said the same thing:
    

      "Call this summer! It is worse than October!"
    

      We used to have tea together and cook porridge, or sit together for hours
      in silence thinking the rain would never stop. Once when Stiepan went away
      to a fair, Masha stayed the night in the mill. When we got up we could not
      tell what time it was for the sky was overcast; the sleepy cocks at
      Dubechnia were crowing, and the corncrakes were trilling in the meadow; it
      was very, very early.... My wife and I walked down to the pool and drew up
      the bow-net that Stiepan had put out in our presence the day before. There
      was one large perch in it and a crayfish angrily stretched out his claws.
    

      "Let them go," said Masha. "Let them be happy too."
    

      Because we got up very early and had nothing to do, the day seemed very
      long, the longest in my life. Stiepan returned before dusk and I went back
      to the farmhouse.
    

      "Your father came here to-day," said Masha.
    

      "Where is he?"
    

      "He has gone. I did not receive him."
    

      Seeing my silence and feeling that I was sorry for my father, she said:
    

      "We must be logical. I did not receive him and sent a message to ask him
      not to trouble us again and not to come and see us."
    

      In a moment I was outside the gates, striding toward the town to make it
      up with my father. It was muddy, slippery, cold. For the first time since
      our marriage I suddenly felt sad, and through my brain, tired with the
      long day, there flashed the thought that perhaps I was not living as I
      ought; I got more and more tired and was gradually overcome with weakness,
      inertia; I had no desire to move or to think, and after walking for some
      time, I waved my hand and went home.
    

      In the middle of the yard stood the engineer in a leather coat with a
      hood. He was shouting:
    

      "Where's the furniture? There was some good Empire furniture, pictures,
      vases. There's nothing left! Damn it, I bought the place with the
      furniture!"
    

      Near him stood Moissey, Mrs. Cheprakov's bailiff, fumbling with his cap; a
      lank fellow of about twenty-five, with a spotty face and little, impudent
      eyes; one side of his face was larger than the other as though he had been
      lain on.
    

      "Yes, Right Honourable Sir, you bought it without the furniture," he said
      sheepishly. "I remember that clearly."
    

      "Silence!" shouted the engineer, going red in the face, and beginning to
      shake, and his shout echoed through the garden.
    

      XII
    

      When I was busy in the garden or the yard, Moissey would stand with his
      hands behind his back and stare at me impertinently with his little eyes.
      And this used to irritate me to such an extent that I would put aside my
      work and go away.
    

      We learned from Stiepan that Moissey had been Mrs. Cheprakov's lover. I
      noticed that when people went to her for money they used to apply to
      Moissey first, and once I saw a peasant, a charcoal-burner, black all
      over, grovel at his feet. Sometimes after a whispered conversation Moissey
      would hand over the money himself without saying anything to his mistress,
      from which I concluded that the transaction was settled on his own
      account.
    

      He used to shoot in our garden, under our very windows, steal food from
      our larder, borrow our horses without leave, and we were furious, feeling
      that Dubechnia was no longer ours, and Masha used to go pale and say:
    

      "Have we to live another year and a half with these creatures?"
    

      Ivan Cheprakov, the son, was a guard on the railway. During the winter he
      got very thin and weak, so that he got drunk on one glass of vodka, and
      felt cold out of the sun. He hated wearing his guard's uniform and was
      ashamed of it, but found his job profitable because he could steal candles
      and sell them. My new position gave him a mixed feeling of astonishment,
      envy, and vague hope that something of the sort might happen to him. He
      used to follow Masha with admiring eyes, and to ask me what I had for
      dinner nowadays, and his ugly, emaciated face used to wear a sweet, sad
      expression, and he used to twitch his fingers as though he could feel my
      happiness with them.
    

      "I say, Little Profit," he would say excitedly, lighting and relighting
      his cigarette; he always made a mess wherever he stood because he used to
      waste a whole box of matches on one cigarette. "I say, my life is about as
      beastly as it could be. Every little squirt of a soldier can shout: 'Here
      guard! Here!' I have such a lot in the trains and you know, mine's a
      rotten life! My mother has ruined me! I heard a doctor say in the train,
      if the parents are loose, their children become drunkards or criminals.
      That's it."
    

      Once he came staggering into the yard. His eyes wandered aimlessly and he
      breathed heavily; he laughed and cried, and said something in a kind of
      frenzy, and through his thickly uttered words I could only hear: "My
      mother? Where is my mother?" and he wailed like a child crying, because it
      has lost its mother in a crowd. I led him away into the garden and laid
      him down under a tree, and all that day and through the night Masha and I
      took it in turns to stay with him. He was sick and Masha looked with
      disgust at his pale, wet face and said:
    

      "Are we to have these creatures on the place for another year and a half?
      It is awful! Awful!"
    

      And what a lot of trouble the peasants gave us! How many disappointments
      we had at the outset, in the spring, when we so longed to be happy! My
      wife built a school. I designed the school for sixty boys, and the Zemstvo
      Council approved the design, but recommended our building the school at
      Kurilovka, the big village, only three miles away; besides the Kurilovka
      school, where the children of four villages, including that of Dubechnia,
      were taught, was old and inadequate and the floor was so rotten that the
      children were afraid to walk on it. At the end of March Masha, by her own
      desire, was appointed trustee of the Kurilovka school, and at the
      beginning of April we called three parish meetings and persuaded the
      peasants that the school was old and inadequate, and that it was necessary
      to build a new one. A member of the Zemstvo Council and the elementary
      school inspector came down too and addressed them. After each meeting we
      were mobbed and asked for a pail of vodka; we felt stifled in the crowd
      and soon got tired and returned home dissatisfied and rather abashed. At
      last the peasants allotted a site for the school and undertook to cart the
      materials from the town. And as soon as the spring corn was sown, on the
      very first Sunday, carts set out from Kurilovka and Dubechnia to fetch the
      bricks for the foundations. They went at dawn and returned late in the
      evening. The peasants were drunk and said they were tired out.
    

      The rain and the cold continued, as though deliberately, all through May.
      The roads were spoiled and deep in mud. When the carts came from town they
      usually drove to our horror, into our yard! A horse would appear in the
      gate, straddling its fore legs, with its big belly heaving; before it came
      into the yard it would strain and heave and after it would come a ten-yard
      beam in a four-wheeled wagon, wet and slimy; alongside it, wrapped up to
      keep the rain out, never looking where he was going and splashing through
      the puddles, a peasant would walk with the skirt of his coat tucked up in
      his belt. Another cart would appear with planks; then a third with a beam;
      then a fourth ... and the yard in front of the house would gradually be
      blocked up with horses, beams, planks. Peasants, men and women with their
      heads wrapped up and their skirts tucked up, would stare morosely at our
      windows, kick up a row and insist on the lady of the house coming out to
      them; and they would curse and swear. And in a corner Moissey would stand,
      and it seemed to us that he delighted in our discomfiture.
    

      "We won't cart any more!" the peasants shouted. "We are tired to death!
      Let her go and cart it herself!"
    

      Pale and scared, thinking they would any minute break into the house,
      Masha would send them money for a pail of vodka; after which the noise
      would die down and the long beams would go jolting out of the yard.
    

      When I went to look at the building my wife would get agitated and say:
    

      "The peasants are furious. They might do something to you. No. Wait. I'll
      go with you."
    

      We used to drive over to Kurilovka together and then the carpenters would
      ask for tips. The framework was ready for the foundations to be laid, but
      the masons never came and when at last the masons did come it was apparent
      that there was no sand; somehow it had been forgotten that sand was
      wanted. Taking advantage of our helplessness, the peasants asked thirty
      copecks a load, although it was less than a quarter of a mile from the
      building to the river where the sand was to be fetched, and more than five
      hundred loads were needed. There were endless misunderstandings, wrangles,
      and continual begging. My wife was indignant and the building contractor,
      Petrov, an old man of seventy, took her by the hand and said:
    

      "You look here! Look here! Just get me sand and I'll find ten men and have
      the work done in two days. Look here!"
    

      Sand was brought, but two, four days, a week passed and still there yawned
      a ditch where the foundations were to be.
    

      "I shall go mad," cried my wife furiously. "What wretches they are! What
      wretches!"
    

      During these disturbances Victor Ivanich used to come and see us. He used
      to bring hampers of wine and dainties, and eat for a long time, and then
      go to sleep on the terrace and snore so that the labourers shook their
      heads and said:
    

      "He's all right!"
    

      Masha took no pleasure in his visits. She did not believe in him, and yet
      she used to ask his advice; when, after a sound sleep after dinner, he got
      up out of humour, and spoke disparagingly of our domestic arrangements,
      and said he was sorry he had ever bought Dubechnia which had cost him so
      much, and poor Masha looked miserably anxious and complained to him, he
      would yawn and say the peasants ought to be flogged.
    

      He called our marriage and the life we were living a comedy, and used to
      say it was a caprice, a whimsy.
    

      "She did the same sort of thing once before," he told me. "She fancied
      herself as an opera singer, and ran away from me. It took me two months to
      find her, and my dear fellow, I wasted a thousand roubles on telegrams
      alone."
    

      He had dropped calling me a sectarian or the House-painter; and no longer
      approved of my life as a working man, but he used to say:
    

      "You are a queer fish! An abnormality. I don't venture to prophesy, but
      you will end badly!"
    

      Masha slept poorly at nights and would sit by the window of our bedroom
      thinking. She no longer laughed and made faces at supper. I suffered, and
      when it rained, every drop cut into my heart like a bullet, and I could
      have gone on my knees to Masha and apologised for the weather. When the
      peasants made a row in the yard, I felt that it was my fault. I would sit
      for hours in one place, thinking only how splendid and how wonderful Masha
      was. I loved her passionately, and I was enraptured by everything she did
      and said. Her taste was for quiet indoor occupation; she loved to read for
      hours and to study; she who knew about farm-work only from books,
      surprised us all by her knowledge and the advice she gave was always
      useful, and when applied was never in vain. And in addition she had the
      fineness, the taste, and the good sense, the very sound sense which only
      very well-bred people possess!
    

      To such a woman, with her healthy, orderly mind, the chaotic environment
      with its petty cares and dirty tittle-tattle, in which we lived, was very
      painful. I could see that, and I, too, could not sleep at night. My brain
      whirled and I could hardly choke back my tears. I tossed about, not
      knowing what to do.
    

      I used to rush to town and bring Masha books, newspapers, sweets, flowers,
      and I used to go fishing with Stiepan, dragging for hours, neck-deep in
      cold water, in the rain, to catch an eel by way of varying our fare. I
      used humbly to ask the peasants not to shout, and I gave them vodka,
      bribed them, promised them anything they asked. And what a lot of other
      foolish things I did!
    

      At last the rain stopped. The earth dried up. I used to get up in the
      morning and go into the garden—dew shining on the flowers, birds and
      insects shrilling, not a cloud in the sky, and the garden, the meadow, the
      river were so beautiful, perfect but for the memory of the peasants and
      the carts and the engineer. Masha and I used to drive out in a car to see
      how the oats were coming on. She drove and I sat behind; her shoulders
      were always a little hunched, and the wind would play with her hair.
    

      "Keep to the right!" she shouted to the passers-by.
    

      "You are like a coachman!" I once said to her.
    

      "Perhaps. My grandfather, my father's father, was a coachman. Didn't you
      know?" she asked, turning round, and immediately she began to mimic the
      way the coachmen shout and sing.
    

      "Thank God!" I thought, as I listened to her. "Thank God!"
    

      And again I remember the peasants, the carts, the engineer....
    

      XIII
    

      Doctor Blagovo came over on a bicycle. My sister began to come often. Once
      more we talked of manual labour and progress, and the mysterious Cross
      awaiting humanity in the remote future. The doctor did not like our life,
      because it interfered with our discussions and he said it was unworthy of
      a free man to plough, and reap, and breed cattle, and that in time all
      such elementary forms of the struggle for existence would be left to
      animals and machines, while men would devote themselves exclusively to
      scientific investigation. And my sister always asked me to let her go home
      earlier, and if she stayed late, or for the night, she was greatly
      distressed.
    

      "Good gracious, what a baby you are," Masha used to say reproachfully. "It
      is quite ridiculous."
    

      "Yes, it is absurd," my sister would agree. "I admit it is absurd, but
      what can I do if I have not the power to control myself. It always seems
      to me that I am doing wrong."
    

      During the haymaking my body, not being used to it, ached all over;
      sitting on the terrace in the evening, I would suddenly fall asleep and
      they would all laugh at me. They would wake me up and make me sit down to
      supper. I would be overcome with drowsiness and in a stupor saw lights,
      faces, plates, and heard voices without understanding what they were
      saying. And I used to get up early in the morning and take my scythe, or
      go to the school and work there all day.
    

      When I was at home on holidays I noticed that my wife and sister were
      hiding something from me and even seemed to be avoiding me. My wife was
      tender with me as always, but she had some new thought of her own which
      she did not communicate to me. Certainly her exasperation with the
      peasants had increased and life was growing harder and harder for her, but
      she no longer complained to me. She talked more readily to the doctor than
      to me, and I could not understand why.
    

      It was the custom in our province for the labourers to come to the farm in
      the evenings to be treated to vodka, even the girls having a glass. We did
      not keep the custom; the haymakers and the women used to come into the
      yard and stay until late in the evening, waiting for vodka, and then they
      went away cursing. And then Masha used to frown and relapse into silence
      or whisper irritably to the doctor:
    

      "Savages! Barbarians!"
    

      Newcomers to the villages were received ungraciously, almost with
      hostility; like new arrivals at a school. At first we were looked upon as
      foolish, soft-headed people who had bought the estate because we did not
      know what to do with our money. We were laughed at. The peasants grazed
      their cattle in our pasture and even in our garden, drove our cows and
      horses into the village and then came and asked for compensation. The
      whole village used to come into our yard and declare loudly that in mowing
      we had cut the border of common land which did not belong to us; and as we
      did not know our boundaries exactly we used to take their word for it and
      pay a fine. But afterward it appeared that we had been in the right. They
      used to bark the young lime-trees in our woods. A Dubechnia peasant, a
      money-lender, who sold vodka without a licence, bribed our labourers to
      help him cheat us in the most treacherous way; he substituted old wheels
      for the new on our wagons, stole our ploughing yokes and sold them back to
      us, and so on. But worst of all was the building at Kurilovka. There the
      women at night stole planks, bricks, tiles, iron; the bailiff and his
      assistants made a search; the women were each fined two roubles by the
      village council, and then the whole lot of them got drunk on the money.
    

      When Masha found out, she would say to the doctor and my sister:
    

      "What beasts! It is horrible! Horrible!"
    

      And more than once I heard her say she was sorry she had decided to build
      the school.
    

      "You must understand," the doctor tried to point out, "that if you build a
      school or undertake any good work, it is not for the peasants, but for the
      sake of culture and the future. The worse the peasants are the more reason
      there is for building a school. Do understand!"
    

      There was a loss of confidence in his voice, and it seemed to me that he
      hated the peasants as much as Masha.
    

      Masha used often to go to the mill with my sister and they would say
      jokingly that they were going to have a look at Stiepan because he was so
      handsome. Stiepan it appeared was reserved and silent only with men, and
      in the company of women was free and talkative. Once when I went down to
      the river to bathe I involuntarily overheard a conversation. Masha and
      Cleopatra, both in white, were sitting on the bank under the broad shade
      of a willow and Stiepan was standing near with his hands behind his back,
      saying:
    

      "But are peasants human beings? Not they; they are, excuse me, brutes,
      beasts, and thieves. What does a peasant's life consist of? Eating and
      drinking, crying for cheaper food, bawling in taverns, without decent
      conversation, or behaviour or manners. Just an ignorant beast! He lives in
      filth, his wife and children live in filth; he sleeps in his clothes;
      takes the potatoes out of the soup with his fingers, drinks down a black
      beetle with his kvass—because he won't trouble to fish it
      out!"
    

      "It is because of their poverty!" protested my sister.
    

      "What poverty? Of course there is want, but there are different kinds of
      necessity. If a man is in prison, or is blind, say, or has lost his legs,
      then he is in a bad way and God help him; but if he is at liberty and in
      command of his senses, if he has eyes and hands and strength, then, good
      God, what more does he want? It is lamentable, my lady, ignorance, but not
      poverty. If you kind people, with your education, out of charity try to
      help him, then he will spend your money in drink, like the swine he is, or
      worse still, he will open a tavern and begin to rob the people on the
      strength of your money. You say—poverty. But does a rich peasant
      live any better? He lives like a pig, too, excuse me, a clodhopper, a
      blusterer, a big-bellied blockhead, with a swollen red mug—makes me
      want to hit him in the eye, the blackguard. Look at Larion of Dubechnia—he
      is rich, but all the same he barks the trees in your woods just like the
      poor; and he is a foul-mouthed brute, and his children are foul-mouthed,
      and when he is drunk he falls flat in the mud and goes to sleep. They are
      all worthless, my lady. It is just hell to live with them in the village.
      The village sticks in my gizzard, and I thank God, the King of heaven,
      that I am well fed and clothed, and that I am a free man; I can live where
      I like, I don't want to live in the village and nobody can force me to do
      it. They say: 'You have a wife.' They say: 'You are obliged to live at
      home with your wife.' Why? I have not sold myself to her."
    

      "Tell me, Stiepan. Did you marry for love?" asked Masha.
    

      "What love is there in a village?" Stiepan answered with a smile. "If you
      want to know, my lady, it is my second marriage. I do not come from
      Kurilovka, but from Zalegosch, and I went to Kurilovka when I married. My
      father did not want to divide the land up between us—there are five
      of us. So I bowed to it and cut adrift and went to another village to my
      wife's family. My first wife died when she was young."
    

      "What did she die of?"
    

      "Foolishness. She used to sit and cry. She was always crying for no reason
      at all and so she wasted away. She used to drink herbs to make herself
      prettier and it must have ruined her inside. And my second wife at
      Kurilovka—what about her? A village woman, a peasant; that's all.
      When the match was being made I was nicely had; I thought she was young,
      nice to look at and clean. Her mother was clean enough, drank coffee and,
      chiefly because they were a clean lot, I got married. Next day we sat down
      to dinner and I told my mother-in-law to fetch me a spoon. She brought me
      a spoon and I saw her wipe it with her finger. So that, thought I, is
      their cleanliness! I lived with them for a year and went away. Perhaps I
      ought to have married a town girl"—he went on after a silence. "They
      say a wife is a helpmate to her husband. What do I want with a helpmate? I
      can look after myself. But you talk to me sensibly and soberly, without
      giggling all the while. He—he—he! What is life without a good
      talk?"
    

      Stiepan suddenly stopped and relapsed into his dreary, monotonous
      "U-lu-lu-lu." That meant that he had noticed me.
    

      Masha used often to visit the mill, she evidently took pleasure in her
      talks with Stiepan; he abused the peasants so sincerely and convincingly—and
      this attracted her to him. When she returned from the mill the idiot who
      looked after the garden used to shout after her:
    

      "Paloshka! Hullo, Paloshka!" And he would bark at her like a dog: "Bow,
      wow!"
    

      And she would stop and stare at him as if she found in the idiot's barking
      an answer to her thought, and perhaps he attracted her as much as
      Stiepan's abuse. And at home she would find some unpleasant news awaiting
      her, as that the village geese had ruined the cabbages in the
      kitchen-garden, or that Larion had stolen the reins, and she would shrug
      her shoulders with a smile and say:
    

      "What can you expect of such people?"
    

      She was exasperated and a fury was gathering in her soul, and I, on the
      other hand, was getting used to the peasants and more and more attracted
      to them. For the most part, they were nervous, irritable, absurd people;
      they were people with suppressed imaginations, ignorant, with a bare, dull
      outlook, always dazed by the same thought of the grey earth, grey days,
      black bread; they were people driven to cunning, but, like birds, they
      only hid their heads behind the trees—they could not reason. They
      did not come to us for the twenty roubles earned by haymaking, but for the
      half-pail of vodka, though they could buy four pails of vodka for the
      twenty roubles. Indeed they were dirty, drunken, and dishonest, but for
      all that one felt that the peasant life as a whole was sound at the core.
      However clumsy and brutal the peasant might look as he followed his
      antiquated plough, and however he might fuddle himself with vodka, still,
      looking at him more closely, one felt that there was something vital and
      important in him, something that was lacking in Masha and the doctor, for
      instance, namely, that he believes that the chief thing on earth is truth,
      that his and everybody's salvation lies in truth, and therefore above all
      else on earth he loves justice. I used to say to my wife that she was
      seeing the stain on the window, but not the glass itself; and she would be
      silent or, like Stiepan, she would hum, "U-lu-lu-lu...." When she, good,
      clever actress that she was, went pale with fury and then harangued the
      doctor in a trembling voice about drunkenness and dishonesty; her
      blindness confounded and appalled me. How could she forget that her
      father, the engineer, drank, drank heavily, and that the money with which
      he bought Dubechnia was acquired by means of a whole series of impudent,
      dishonest swindles? How could she forget?
    

      XIV
    

      And my sister, too, was living with her own private thoughts which she hid
      from me. She used often to sit whispering with Masha. When I went up to
      her, she would shrink away, and her eyes would look guilty and full of
      entreaty. Evidently there was something going on in her soul of which she
      was afraid or ashamed. To avoid meeting me in the garden or being left
      alone with me she clung to Masha and I hardly ever had a chance to talk to
      her except at dinner.
    

      One evening, on my way home from the school, I came quietly through the
      garden. It had already begun to grow dark. Without noticing me or hearing
      footsteps, my sister walked round an old wide-spreading apple-tree,
      perfectly noiselessly like a ghost. She was in black, and walked very
      quickly, up and down, up and down, with her eyes on the ground. An apple
      fell from the tree, she started at the noise, stopped and pressed her
      hands to her temples. At that moment I went up to her.
    

      In an impulse of tenderness, which suddenly came rushing to my heart, with
      tears in my eyes, somehow remembering our mother and our childhood, I took
      hold of her shoulders and kissed her.
    

      "What is the matter?" I asked. "You are suffering. I have seen it for a
      long time now. Tell me, what is the matter?"
    

      "I am afraid...." she murmured, with a shiver.
    

      "What's the matter with you?" I inquired. "For God's sake, be frank!"
    

      "I will, I will be frank. I will tell you the whole truth. It is so hard,
      so painful to conceal anything from you!... Misail, I am in love." She
      went on in a whisper. "Love, love.... I am happy, but I am afraid."
    

      I heard footsteps and Doctor Blagovo appeared among the trees. He was
      wearing a silk shirt and high boots. Clearly they had arranged a
      rendezvous by the apple-tree. When she saw him she flung herself
      impulsively into his arms with a cry of anguish, as though he was being
      taken away from her:
    

      "Vladimir! Vladimir!"
    

      She clung to him, and gazed eagerly at him and only then I noticed how
      thin and pale she had become. It was especially noticeable through her
      lace collar, which I had known for years, for it now hung loosely about
      her slim neck. The doctor was taken aback, but controlled himself at once,
      and said, as he stroked her hair:
    

      "That's enough. Enough!... Why are you so nervous? You see, I have come."
    

      We were silent for a time, bashfully glancing at each other. Then we all
      moved away and I heard the doctor saying to me:
    

      "Civilised life has not yet begun with us. The old console themselves with
      saying that, if there is nothing now, there was something in the forties
      and the sixties; that is all right for the old ones, but we are young and
      our brains are not yet touched with senile decay. We cannot console
      ourselves with such illusions. The beginning of Russia was in 862, and
      civilised Russia, as I understand it, has not yet begun."
    

      But I could not bother about what he was saying. It was very strange, but
      I could not believe that my sister was in love, that she had just been
      walking with her hand on the arm of a stranger and gazing at him tenderly.
      My sister, poor, frightened, timid, downtrodden creature as she was, loved
      a man who was already married and had children! I was full of pity without
      knowing why; the doctor's presence was distasteful to me and I could not
      make out what was to come of such a love.
    

      XV
    

      Masha and I drove over to Kurilovka for the opening of the school.
    

      "Autumn, autumn, autumn...." said Masha, looking about her. Summer had
      passed. There were no birds and only the willows were green.
    

      Yes. Summer had passed. The days were bright and warm, but it was fresh in
      the mornings; the shepherds went out in their sheepskins, and the dew
      never dried all day on the asters in the garden. There were continual
      mournful sounds and it was impossible to tell whether it was a shutter
      creaking on its rusty hinges or the cranes flying—and one felt so
      well and so full of the desire for life!
    

      "Summer has passed...." said Masha. "Now we can both make up our accounts.
      We have worked hard and thought a great deal and we are the better for it—all
      honour and praise to us; we have improved ourselves; but have our
      successes had any perceptible influence on the life around us, have they
      been of any use to a single person? No! Ignorance, dirt, drunkenness, a
      terribly high rate of infant mortality—everything is just as it was,
      and no one is any the better for your having ploughed and sown and my
      having spent money and read books. Evidently we have only worked and
      broadened our minds for ourselves."
    

      I was abashed by such arguments and did not know what to think.
    

      "From beginning to end we have been sincere," I said, "and if a man is
      sincere, he is right."
    

      "Who denies that? We have been right but we have been wrong in our way of
      setting about it. First of all, are not our very ways of living wrong? You
      want to be useful to people, but by the mere fact of buying an estate you
      make it impossible to be so. Further, if you work, dress, and eat like a
      peasant you lend your authority and approval to the clumsy clothes, and
      their dreadful houses and their dirty beards.... On the other hand,
      suppose you work for a long, long time, all you life, and in the end
      obtain some practical results—what will your results amount to, what
      can they do against such elemental forces as wholesale ignorance, hunger,
      cold, and degeneracy? A drop in the ocean! Other methods of fighting are
      necessary, strong, bold, quick! If you want to be useful then you must
      leave the narrow circle of common activity and try to act directly on the
      masses! First of all, you need vigorous, noisy, propaganda. Why are art
      and music, for instance, so much alive and so popular and so powerful?
      Because the musician or the singer influences thousands directly. Art,
      wonderful art!" She looked wistfully at the sky and went on: "Art gives
      wings and carries you far, far away. If you are bored with dirt and
      pettifogging interests, if you are exasperated and outraged and indignant,
      rest and satisfaction are only to be found in beauty."
    

      As we approached Kurilovka the weather was fine, clear, and joyous. In the
      yards the peasants were thrashing and there was a smell of corn and straw.
      Behind the wattled hedges the fruit-trees were reddening and all around
      the trees were red or golden. In the church-tower the bells were ringing,
      the children were carrying ikons to the school and singing the Litany of
      the Virgin. And how clear the air was, and how high the doves soared!
    

      The Te Deum was sung in the schoolroom. Then the Kurilovka peasants
      presented Masha with an ikon, and the Dubechnia peasants gave her a large
      cracknel and a gilt salt-cellar. And Masha began to weep.
    

      "And if we have said anything out of the way or have been discontented,
      please forgive us," said an old peasant, bowing to us both.
    

      As we drove home Masha looked back at the school. The green roof which I
      had painted glistened in the sun, and we could see it for a long time. And
      I felt that Masha's glances were glances of farewell.
    

      XVI
    

      In the evening she got ready to go to town.
    

      She had often been to town lately to stay the night. In her absence I
      could not work, and felt listless and disheartened; our big yard seemed
      dreary, disgusting, and deserted; there were ominous noises in the garden,
      and without her the house, the trees, the horses were no longer "ours."
    

      I never went out but sat all the time at her writing-table among her books
      on farming and agriculture, those deposed favourites, wanted no more,
      which looked out at me so shamefacedly from the bookcase. For hours
      together, while it struck seven, eight, nine, and the autumn night crept
      up as black as soot to the windows, I sat brooding over an old glove of
      hers, or the pen she always used, and her little scissors. I did nothing
      and saw clearly that everything I had done before, ploughing, sowing, and
      felling trees, had only been because she wanted it. And if she told me to
      clean out a well, when I had to stand waist-deep in water, I would go and
      do it, without trying to find out whether the well wanted cleaning or not.
      And now, when she was away, Dubechnia with its squalor, its litter, its
      slamming shutters, with thieves prowling about it day and night, seemed to
      me like a chaos in which work was entirely useless. And why should I work,
      then? Why trouble and worry about the future, when I felt that the ground
      was slipping away from under me, that my position at Dubechnia was hollow,
      that, in a word, the same fate awaited me as had befallen the books on
      agriculture? Oh! what anguish it was at night, in the lonely hours, when I
      lay listening uneasily, as though I expected some one any minute to call
      out that it was time for me to go away. I was not sorry to leave
      Dubechnia, my sorrow was for my love, for which it seemed that autumn had
      already begun. What a tremendous happiness it is to love and to be loved,
      and what a horror it is to feel that you are beginning to topple down from
      that lofty tower!
    

      Masha returned from town toward evening on the following day. She was
      dissatisfied with something, but concealed it and said only: "Why have the
      winter windows been put in? It will be stifling." I opened two of the
      windows. We did not feel like eating, but we sat down and had supper.
    

      "Go and wash your hands," she said. "You smell of putty."
    

      She had brought some new illustrated magazines from town and we both read
      them after supper. They had supplements with fashion-plates and patterns.
      Masha just glanced at them and put them aside to look at them carefully
      later on; but one dress, with a wide, bell-shaped skirt and big sleeves
      interested her, and for a moment she looked at it seriously and
      attentively.
    

      "That's not bad," she said.
    

      "Yes, it would suit you very well," said I. "Very well."
    

      And I admired the dress, only because she liked it, and went on tenderly:
    

      "A wonderful, lovely dress! Lovely, wonderful, Masha. My dear Masha!"
    

      And tears began to drop on the fashion-plate.
    

      "Wonderful Masha...." I murmured. "Dear, darling Masha...."
    

      She went and lay down and I sat still for an hour and looked at the
      illustrations.
    

      "You should not have opened the windows," she called from the bedroom.
      "I'm afraid it will be cold. Look how the wind is blowing in!"
    

      I read the miscellany, about the preparation of cheap fish, and the size
      of the largest diamond in the world. Then I chanced on the picture of the
      dress she had liked and I imagined her at a ball, with a fan, and bare
      shoulders, a brilliant, dazzling figure, well up in music and painting and
      literature, and how insignificant and brief my share in her life seemed to
      be!
    

      Our coming together, our marriage, was only an episode, one of many in the
      life of this lively, highly gifted creature. All the best things in the
      world, as I have said, were at her service, and she had them for nothing;
      even ideas and fashionable intellectual movements served her pleasure, a
      diversion in her existence, and I was only the coachman who drove her from
      one infatuation to another. Now I was no longer necessary to her; she
      would fly away and I should be left alone.
    

      As if in answer to my thoughts a desperate scream suddenly came from the
      yard:
    

      "Mur-der!"
    

      It was a shrill female voice, and exactly as though it were trying to
      imitate it, the wind also howled dismally in the chimney. Half a minute
      passed and again it came through the sound of the wind, but as though from
      the other end of the yard:
    

      "Mur-der!"
    

      "Misail, did you hear that?" said my wife in a hushed voice. "Did you
      hear?"
    

      She came out of the bedroom in her nightgown, with her hair down, and
      stood listening and staring out of the dark window.
    

      "Somebody is being murdered!" she muttered. "It only wanted that!"
    

      I took my gun and went out; it was very dark outside; a violent wind was
      blowing so that it was hard to stand up. I walked to the gate and
      listened; the trees were moaning; the wind went whistling through them,
      and in the garden the idiot's dog was howling. Beyond the gate it was
      pitch dark; there was not a light on the railway. And just by the wing,
      where the offices used to be, I suddenly heard a choking cry:
    

      "Mur-der!"
    

      "Who is there?" I called.
    

      Two men were locked in a struggle. One had nearly thrown the other, who
      was resisting with all his might. And both were breathing heavily.
    

      "Let go!" said one of them and I recognised Ivan Cheprakov. It was he who
      had cried out in a thin, falsetto voice. "Let go, damn you, or I'll bite
      your hands!"
    

      The other man I recognised as Moissey. I parted them and could not resist
      hitting Moissey in the face twice. He fell down, then got up, and I struck
      him again.
    

      "He tried to kill me," he muttered. "I caught him creeping to his mother's
      drawer.... I tried to shut him up in the wing for safety."
    

      Cheprakov was drunk and did not recognise me. He stood gasping for breath
      as though trying to get enough wind to shriek again.
    

      I left them and went back to the house. My wife was lying on the bed,
      fully dressed. I told her what had happened in the yard and did not keep
      back the fact that I had struck Moissey.
    

      "Living in the country is horrible," she said. "And what a long night it
      is!"
    

      "Mur-der!" we heard again, a little later.
    

      "I'll go and part them," I said.
    

      "No. Let them kill each other," she said with an expression of disgust.
    

      She lay staring at the ceiling, listening, and I sat near her, not daring
      to speak and feeling that it was my fault that screams of "murder" came
      from the yard and the night was so long.
    

      We were silent and I waited impatiently for the light to peep in at the
      window. And Masha looked as though she had wakened from a long sleep and
      was astonished to find herself, so clever, so educated, so refined, cast
      away in this miserable provincial hole, among a lot of petty, shallow
      people, and to think that she could have so far forgotten herself as to
      have been carried away by one of them and to have been his wife for more
      than half a year. It seemed to me that we were all the same to her—myself,
      Moissey, Cheprakov; all swept together into the drunken, wild scream of
      "murder"—myself, our marriage, our work, and the muddy roads of
      autumn; and when she breathed or stirred to make herself more comfortable
      I could read in her eyes: "Oh, if the morning would come quicker!"
    

      In the morning she went away.
    

      I stayed at Dubechnia for another three days, waiting for her; then I
      moved all our things into one room, locked it, and went to town. When I
      rang the bell at the engineer's, it was evening, and the lamps were alight
      in Great Gentry Street. Pavel told me that nobody was at home; Victor
      Ivanich had gone to Petersburg and Maria Victorovna must be at a rehearsal
      at the Azhoguins'. I remember the excitement with which I went to the
      Azhoguins', and how my heart thumped and sank within me, as I went
      up-stairs and stood for a long while on the landing, not daring to enter
      that temple of the Muses! In the hall, on the table, on the piano, on the
      stage, there were candles burning; all in threes, for the first
      performance was fixed for the thirteenth, and the dress rehearsal was on
      Monday—the unlucky day. A fight against prejudice! All the lovers of
      dramatic art were assembled; the eldest, the middle, and the youngest Miss
      Azhoguin were walking about the stage, reading their parts. Radish was
      standing still in a corner all by himself, with his head against the wall,
      looking at the stage with adoring eyes, waiting for the beginning of the
      rehearsal. Everything was just the same!
    

      I went toward my hostess to greet her, when suddenly everybody began to
      say "Ssh" and to wave their hands to tell me not to make such a noise.
      There was a silence. The top of the piano was raised, a lady sat down,
      screwing up her short-sighted eyes at the music, and Masha stood by the
      piano, dressed up, beautiful, but beautiful in an odd new way, not at all
      like the Masha who used to come to see me at the mill in the spring. She
      began to sing:
    

      "Why do I love thee, straight night?"
    

      It was the first time since I had known her that I had heard her sing. She
      had a fine, rich, powerful voice, and to hear her sing was like eating a
      ripe, sweet-scented melon. She finished the song and was applauded. She
      smiled and looked pleased, made play with her eyes, stared at the music,
      plucked at her dress exactly like a bird which has broken out of its cage
      and preens its wings at liberty. Her hair was combed back over her ears,
      and she had a sly defiant expression on her face, as though she wished to
      challenge us all, or to shout at us, as though we were horses: "Gee up,
      old things!"
    

      And at that moment she must have looked very like her grandfather, the
      coachman.
    

      "You here, too?" she asked, giving me her hand. "Did you hear me sing? How
      did you like it?" And, without waiting for me to answer she went on: "You
      arrived very opportunely. I'm going to Petersburg for a short time
      to-night. May I?"
    

      At midnight I took her to the station. She embraced me tenderly, probably
      out of gratitude, because I did not pester her with useless questions, and
      she promised to write to me, and I held her hands for a long time and
      kissed them, finding it hard to keep back my tears, and not saying a word.
    

      And when the train moved, I stood looking at the receding lights, kissed
      her in my imagination and whispered:
    

      "Masha dear, wonderful Masha!..."
    

      I spent the night at Mikhokhov, at Karpovna's, and in the morning I worked
      with Radish, upholstering the furniture at a rich merchant's, who had
      married his daughter to a doctor.
    

      XVII
    

      On Sunday afternoon my sister came to see me and had tea with me.
    

      "I read a great deal now," she said, showing me the books she had got out
      of the town library on her way. "Thanks to your wife and Vladimir. They
      awakened my self-consciousness. They saved me and have made me feel that I
      am a human being. I used not to sleep at night for worrying: 'What a lot
      of sugar has been wasted during the week.' 'The cucumbers must not be
      oversalted!' I don't sleep now, but I have quite different thoughts. I am
      tormented with the thought that half my life has passed so foolishly and
      half-heartedly. I despise my old life. I am ashamed of it. And I regard my
      father now as an enemy. Oh, how grateful I am to your wife! And Vladimir.
      He is such a wonderful man! They opened my eyes."
    

      "It is not good that you can't sleep," I said.
    

      "You think I am ill? Not a bit. Vladimir sounded me and says I am
      perfectly healthy. But health is not the point. That doesn't matter so
      much.... Tell me, am I right?"
    

      She needed moral support. That was obvious. Masha had gone, Doctor Blagovo
      was in Petersburg, and there was no one except myself in the town, who
      could tell her that she was right. She fixed her eyes on me, trying to
      read my inmost thoughts, and if I were sad in her presence, she always
      took it upon herself and was depressed. I had to be continually on my
      guard, and when she asked me if she was right, I hastened to assure her
      that she was right and that I had a profound respect for her.
    

      "You know, they have given me a part at the Azhoguins'," she went on. "I
      wanted to act. I want to live. I want to drink deep of life; I have no
      talent whatever, and my part is only ten lines, but it is immeasurably
      finer and nobler than pouring out tea five times a day and watching to see
      that the cook does not eat the sugar left over. And most of all I want to
      let father see that I too can protest."
    

      After tea she lay down on my bed and stayed there for some time, with her
      eyes closed, and her face very pale.
    

      "Just weakness!" she said, as she got up. "Vladimir said all town girls
      and women are anæmic from lack of work. What a clever man Vladimir
      is! He is right; wonderfully right! We do need work!"
    

      Two days later she came to rehearsal at the Azhoguins' with her part in
      her hand. She was in black, with a garnet necklace, and a brooch that
      looked at a distance like a pasty, and she had enormous earrings, in each
      of which sparkled a diamond. I felt uneasy when I saw her; I was shocked
      by her lack of taste. The others noticed too that she was unsuitably
      dressed and that her earrings and diamonds were out of place. I saw their
      smiles and heard some one say jokingly:
    

      "Cleopatra of Egypt!"
    

      She was trying to be fashionable, and easy, and assured, and she seemed
      affected and odd. She lost her simplicity and her charm.
    

      "I just told father that I was going to a rehearsal," she began, coming up
      to me, "and he shouted that he would take his blessing from me, and he
      nearly struck me. Fancy," she added, glancing at her part, "I don't know
      my part. I'm sure to make a mistake. Well, the die is cast," she said
      excitedly; "the die is cast."
    

      She felt that all the people were looking at her and were all amazed at
      the important step she had taken and that they were all expecting
      something remarkable from her, and it was impossible to convince her that
      nobody took any notice of such small uninteresting persons as she and I.
    

      She had nothing to do until the third act, and her part, a guest, a
      country gossip, consisted only in standing by the door, as if she were
      overhearing something, and then speaking a short monologue. For at least
      an hour and a half before her cue, while the others were walking, reading,
      having tea, quarrelling, she never left me and kept on mumbling her part,
      and dropping her written copy, imagining that everybody was looking at
      her, and waiting for her to come on, and she patted her hair with a
      trembling hand and said:
    

      "I'm sure to make a mistake.... You don't know how awful I feel! I am as
      terrified as if I were going to the scaffold."
    

      At last her cue came.
    

      "Cleopatra Alexeyevna—your cue!" said the manager.
    

      She walked on to the middle of the stage with an expression of terror on
      her face; she looked ugly and stiff, and for half a minute was speechless,
      perfectly motionless, except for her large earrings which wabbled on
      either side of her face.
    

      "You can read your part, the first time," said some one.
    

      I could see that she was trembling so that she could neither speak nor
      open her part, and that she had entirely forgotten the words and I had
      just made up my mind to go up and say something to her when she suddenly
      dropped down on her knees in the middle of the stage and sobbed loudly.
    

      There was a general stir and uproar. And I stood quite still by the wings,
      shocked by what had happened, not understanding at all, not knowing what
      to do. I saw them lift her up and lead her away. I saw Aniuta Blagovo come
      up to me. I had not seen her in the hall before and she seemed to have
      sprung up from the floor. She was wearing a hat and veil, and as usual
      looked as if she had only dropped in for a minute.
    

      "I told her not to try to act," she said angrily, biting out each word,
      with her cheeks blushing. "It is folly! You ought to have stopped her!"
    

      Mrs. Azhoguin came up in a short jacket with short sleeves. She had
      tobacco ash on her thin, flat bosom.
    

      "My dear, it is too awful!" she said, wringing her hands, and as usual,
      staring into my face. "It is too awful!... Your sister is in a
      condition.... She is going to have a baby! You must take her away at
      once...."
    

      In her agitation she breathed heavily. And behind her, stood her three
      daughters, all thin and flat-chested like herself, and all huddled
      together in their dismay. They were frightened, overwhelmed just as if a
      convict had been caught in the house. What a shame! How awful! And this
      was the family that had been fighting the prejudices and superstitions of
      mankind all their lives; evidently they thought that all the prejudices
      and superstitions of mankind were to be found in burning three candles and
      in the number thirteen, or the unlucky day—Monday.
    

      "I must request ... request ..." Mrs. Azhoguin kept on saying, compressing
      her lips and accentuating the quest. "I must request you to take
      her away."
    

      XVIII
    

      A little later my sister and I were walking along the street. I covered
      her with the skirt of my overcoat; we hurried along through by-streets,
      where there were no lamps, avoiding the passers-by, and it was like a
      flight. She did not weep any more, but stared at me with dry eyes. It was
      about twenty minutes' walk to Mikhokhov, whither I was taking her, and in
      that short time we went over the whole of our lives, and talked over
      everything, and considered the position and pondered....
    

      We decided that we could not stay in the town, and that when I could get
      some money, we would go to some other place. In some of the houses the
      people were asleep already, and in others they were playing cards; we
      hated those houses, were afraid of them, and we talked of the fanaticism,
      callousness, and nullity of these respectable families, these lovers of
      dramatic art whom we had frightened so much, and I wondered how those
      stupid, cruel, slothful, dishonest people were better than the drunken and
      superstitious peasants of Kurilovka, or how they were better than animals,
      which also lose their heads when some accident breaks the monotony of
      their lives, which are limited by their instincts. What would happen to my
      sister if she stayed at home? What moral torture would she have to
      undergo, talking to my father and meeting acquaintances every day? I
      imagined it all and there came into my memory people I had known who had
      been gradually dropped by their friends and relations, and I remember the
      tortured dogs which had gone mad, and sparrows plucked alive and thrown
      into the water—and a whole long series of dull, protracted
      sufferings which I had seen going on in the town since my childhood; and I
      could not conceive what the sixty thousand inhabitants lived for, why they
      read the Bible, why they prayed, why they skimmed books and magazines.
      What good was all that had been written and said, if they were in the same
      spiritual darkness and had the same hatred of freedom, as if they were
      living hundreds and hundreds of years ago? The builder spends his time
      putting up houses all over the town, and yet would go down to his grave
      saying "galdary" for "gallery." And the sixty thousand inhabitants had
      read and heard of truth and mercy and freedom for generations, but to the
      bitter end they would go on lying from morning to night, tormenting one
      another, fearing and hating freedom as a deadly enemy.
    

      "And so, my fate is decided," said my sister when we reached home. "After
      what has happened I can never go there again. My God, how good it
      is! I feel at peace."
    

      She lay down at once. Tears shone on her eyelashes, but her expression was
      happy. She slept soundly and softly, and it was clear that her heart was
      easy and that she was at rest. For a long, long time she had not slept so
      well.
    

      So we began to live together. She was always singing and said she felt
      very well, and I took back the books we had borrowed from the library
      unread, because she gave up reading; she only wanted to dream and to talk
      of the future. She would hum as she mended my clothes or helped Karpovna
      with the cooking, or talk of her Vladimir, of his mind, and his goodness,
      and his fine manners, and his extraordinary learning. And I agreed with
      her, though I no longer liked the doctor. She wanted to work, to be
      independent, and to live by herself, and she said she would become a
      school-teacher or a nurse as soon as her health allowed, and she would
      scrub the floors and do her own washing. She loved her unborn baby
      passionately, and she knew already the colour of his eyes and the shape of
      his hands and how he laughed. She liked to talk of his upbringing, and
      since the best man on earth was Vladimir, all her ideas were reduced to
      making the boy as charming as his father. There was no end to her chatter,
      and everything she talked about filled her with a lively joy. Sometimes I,
      too, rejoiced, though I knew not why.
    

      She must have infected me with her dreaminess, for I, too, read nothing
      and just dreamed. In the evenings, in spite of being tired, I used to pace
      up and down the room with my hands in my pockets, talking about Masha.
    

      "When do you think she will return?" I used to ask my sister. "I think
      she'll be back at Christmas. Not later. What is she doing there?"
    

      "If she doesn't write to you, it means she must be coming soon."
    

      "True," I would agree, though I knew very well that there was nothing to
      make Masha return to our town.
    

      I missed her very much, but I could not help deceiving myself and wanted
      others to deceive me. My sister was longing for her doctor, I for Masha,
      and we both laughed and talked and never saw that we were keeping Karpovna
      from sleeping. She would lie on the stove and murmur:
    

      "The samovar tinkled this morning. Tink-led! That bodes nobody any good,
      my merry friends!"
    

      Nobody came to the house except the postman who brought my sister letters
      from the doctor, and Prokofyi, who used to come in sometimes in the
      evening and glance secretly at my sister, and then go into the kitchen and
      say:
    

      "Every class has its ways, and if you're too proud to understand that, the
      worse for you in this vale of tears."
    

      He loved the expression—vale of tears. And—about Christmas
      time—when I was going through the market, he called me into his
      shop, and without giving me his hand, declared that he had some important
      business to discuss. He was red in the face with the frost and with vodka;
      near him by the counter stood Nicolka of the murderous face, holding a
      bloody knife in his hand.
    

      "I want to be blunt with you," began Prokofyi. "This business must not
      happen because, as you know, people will neither forgive you nor us for
      such a vale of tears. Mother, of course, is too dutiful to say anything
      unpleasant to you herself, and tell you that your sister must go somewhere
      else because of her condition, but I don't want it either, because I do
      not approve of her behaviour."
    

      I understood and left the shop. That very day my sister and I went to
      Radish's. We had no money for a cab, so we went on foot; I carried a
      bundle with all our belongings on my back, my sister had nothing in her
      hands, and she was breathless and kept coughing and asking if we would
      soon be there.
    

      XIX
    

      At last there came a letter from Masha.
    

      "My dear, kind M. A.," she wrote, "my brave, sweet angel, as the old
      painter calls you, good-bye. I am going to America with my father for the
      exhibition. In a few days I shall be on the ocean—so far from
      Dubechnia. It is awful to think of! It is vast and open like the sky and I
      long for it and freedom. I rejoice and dance about and you see how
      incoherent my letter is. My dear Misail, give me my freedom. Quick, tear
      the thread which still holds and binds us. My meeting and knowing you was
      a ray from heaven, which brightened my existence. But, you know, my
      becoming your wife was a mistake, and the knowledge of the mistake weighs
      me down, and I implore you on my knees, my dear, generous friend, quick—quick—before
      I go over the sea—wire that you will agree to correct our mutual
      mistake, remove then the only burden on my wings, and my father, who will
      be responsible for the whole business, has promised me not to overwhelm
      you with formalities. So, then, I am free of the whole world? Yes?
    

      "Be happy. God bless you. Forgive my wickedness.
    

      "I am alive and well. I am squandering money on all sorts of follies, and
      every minute I thank God that such a wicked woman as I am has no children.
      I am singing and I am a success, but it is not a passing whim. No. It is
      my haven, my convent cell where I go for rest. King David had a ring with
      an inscription: 'Everything passes.' When one is sad, these words make one
      cheerful; and when one is cheerful, they make one sad. And I have got a
      ring with the words written in Hebrew, and this talisman will keep me from
      losing my heart and head. Or does one need nothing but consciousness of
      freedom, because, when one is free, one wants nothing, nothing, nothing.
      Snap the thread then. I embrace you and your sister warmly. Forgive and
      forget your M."
    

      My sister had one room. Radish, who had been ill and was recovering, was
      in the other. Just as I received this letter, my sister went into the
      painter's room and sat by his side and began to read to him. She read
      Ostrovsky or Gogol to him every day, and he used to listen, staring
      straight in front of him, never laughing, shaking his head, and every now
      and then muttering to himself:
    

      "Anything may happen! Anything may happen!"
    

      If there was anything ugly in what she read, he would say vehemently,
      pointing to the book:
    

      "There it is! Lies! That's what lies do!"
    

      Stories used to attract him by their contents as well as by their moral
      and their skilfully complicated plot, and he used to marvel at him,
      though he never called him by his name.
    

      "How well he has managed it."
    

      Now my sister read a page quickly and then stopped, because her breath
      failed her. Radish held her hand, and moving his dry lips he said in a
      hoarse, hardly audible voice:
    

      "The soul of the righteous is white and smooth as chalk; and the soul of
      the sinner is as a pumice-stone. The soul of the righteous is clear oil,
      and the soul of the sinner is coal-tar. We must work and sorrow and pity,"
      he went on. "And if a man does not work and sorrow he will not enter the
      kingdom of heaven. Woe, woe to the well fed, woe to the strong, woe to the
      rich, woe to the usurers! They will not see the kingdom of heaven. Grubs
      eat grass, rust eats iron...."
    

      "And lies devour the soul," said my sister, laughing.
    

      I read the letter once more. At that moment the soldier came into the
      kitchen who had brought in twice a week, without saying from whom, tea,
      French bread, and pigeons, all smelling of scent. I had no work and used
      to sit at home for days together, and probably the person who sent us the
      bread knew that we were in want.
    

      I heard my sister talking to the soldier and laughing merrily. Then she
      lay down and ate some bread and said to me:
    

      "When you wanted to get away from the office and become a house-painter,
      Aniuta Blagovo and I knew from the very beginning that you were right, but
      we were afraid to say so. Tell me what power is it that keeps us from
      saying what we feel? There's Aniuta Blagovo. She loves you, adores you,
      and she knows that you are right. She loves me, too, like a sister, and
      she knows that I am right, and in her heart she envies me, but some power
      prevents her coming to see us. She avoids us. She is afraid."
    

      My sister folded her hands across her bosom and said rapturously:
    

      "If you only knew how she loves you! She confessed it to me and to no one
      else, very hesitatingly, in the dark. She used to take me out into the
      garden, into the dark, and begin to tell me in a whisper how dear you were
      to her. You will see that she will never marry because she loves you. Are
      you sorry for her?"
    

      "Yes."
    

      "It was she sent the bread. She is funny. Why should she hide herself? I
      used to be silly and stupid, but I left all that and I am not afraid of
      any one, and I think and say aloud what I like—and I am happy. When
      I lived at home I had no notion of happiness, and now I would not change
      places with a queen."
    

      Doctor Blagovo came. He had got his diploma and was now living in the
      town, at his father's, taking a rest. After which he said he would go back
      to Petersburg. He wanted to devote himself to vaccination against typhus,
      and, I believe, cholera; he wanted to go abroad to increase his knowledge
      and then to become a University professor. He had already left the army
      and wore serge clothes, with well-cut coats, wide trousers, and expensive
      ties. My sister was enraptured with his pins and studs and his red-silk
      handkerchief, which, out of swagger, he wore in his outside breast-pocket.
      Once, when we had nothing to do, she and I fell to counting up his suits
      and came to the conclusion that he must have at least ten. It was clear
      that he still loved my sister, but never once, even in joke, did he talk
      of taking her to Petersburg or abroad with him, and I could not imagine
      what would happen to her if she lived, or what was to become of her child.
      But she was happy in her dreams and would not think seriously of the
      future. She said he could go wherever he liked and even cast her aside, if
      only he were happy himself, and what had been was enough for her.
    

      Usually when he came to see us he would sound her very carefully, and ask
      her to drink some milk with some medicine in it. He did so now. He sounded
      her and made her drink a glass of milk, and the room began to smell of
      creosote.
    

      "That's a good girl," he said, taking the glass from her. "You must not
      talk much, and you have been chattering like a magpie lately. Please, be
      quiet."
    

      She began to laugh and he came into Radish's room, where I was sitting,
      and tapped me affectionately on the shoulder.
    

      "Well, old man, how are you?" he asked, bending over the patient.
    

      "Sir," said Radish, only just moving his lips. "Sir, I make so bold.... We
      are all in the hands of God, and we must all die.... Let me tell you the
      truth, sir.... You will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
    

      And suddenly I lost consciousness and was caught up into a dream: it was
      winter, at night, and I was standing in the yard of the slaughter-house
      with Prokofyi by my side, smelling of pepper-brandy; I pulled myself
      together and rubbed my eyes and then I seemed to be going to the
      governor's for an explanation. Nothing of the kind ever happened to me,
      before or after, and I can only explain these strange dreams like
      memories, by ascribing them to overstrain of the nerves. I lived again
      through the scene in the slaughter-house and the conversation with the
      governor, and at the same time I was conscious of its unreality.
    

      When I came to myself I saw that I was not at home, but standing with the
      doctor by a lamp in the street.
    

      "It is sad, sad," he was saying with tears running down his cheeks. "She
      is happy and always laughing and full of hope. But, poor darling, her
      condition is hopeless. Old Radish hates me and keeps trying to make me
      understand that I have wronged her. In his way he is right, but I have my
      point of view, too, and I do not repent of what has happened. It is
      necessary to love. We must all love. That's true, isn't it? Without love
      there would be no life, and a man who avoids and fears love is not free."
    

      We gradually passed to other subjects. He began to speak of science and
      his dissertation which had been very well received in Petersburg. He spoke
      enthusiastically and thought no more of my sister, or of his going, or of
      myself. Life was carrying him away. She has America and a ring with an
      inscription, I thought, and he has his medical degree and his scientific
      career, and my sister and I are left with the past.
    

      When we parted I stood beneath the lamp and read my letter again. And I
      remembered vividly how she came to me at the mill that spring morning and
      lay down and covered herself with my fur coat—pretending to be just
      a peasant woman. And another time—also in the early morning—when
      we pulled the bow-net out of the water, and the willows on the bank
      showered great drops of water on us and we laughed....
    

      All was dark in our house in Great Gentry Street. I climbed the fence,
      and, as I used to do in old days, I went into the kitchen by the back door
      to get a little lamp. There was nobody in the kitchen. On the stove the
      samovar was singing merrily, all ready for my father. "Who pours out my
      father's tea now?" I thought. I took the lamp and went on to the shed and
      made a bed of old newspapers and lay down. The nails in the wall looked
      ominous as before and their shadows flickered. It was cold. I thought I
      saw my sister coming in with my supper, but I remembered at once that she
      was ill at Radish's, and it seemed strange to me that I should have
      climbed the fence and be lying in the cold shed. My mind was blurred and
      filled with fantastic imaginations.
    

      A bell rang; sounds familiar from childhood; first the wire rustled along
      the wall, and then there was a short, melancholy tinkle in the kitchen. It
      was my father returning from the club. I got up and went into the kitchen.
      Akhsinya, the cook, clapped her hands when she saw me and began to cry:
    

      "Oh, my dear," she said in a whisper. "Oh, my dear! My God!"
    

      And in her agitation she began to pluck at her apron. On the window-sill
      were two large bottles of berries soaking in vodka. I poured out a cup and
      gulped it down, for I was very thirsty. Akhsinya had just scrubbed the
      table and the chairs, and the kitchen had the good smell which kitchens
      always have when the cook is clean and tidy. This smell and the trilling
      of the cricket used to entice us into the kitchen when we were children,
      and there we used to be told fairy-tales, and we played at kings and
      queens....
    

      "And where is Cleopatra?" asked Akhsinya hurriedly, breathlessly. "And
      where is your hat, sir? And they say your wife has gone to Petersburg."
    

      She had been with us in my mother's time and used to bathe Cleopatra and
      me in a tub, and we were still children to her, and it was her duty to
      correct us. In a quarter of an hour or so she laid bare all her thoughts,
      which she had been storing up in her quiet kitchen all the time I had been
      away. She said the doctor ought to be made to marry Cleopatra—we
      would only have to frighten him a bit and make him send in a nicely
      written application, and then the archbishop would dissolve his first
      marriage, and it would be a good thing to sell Dubechnia without saying
      anything to my wife, and to bank the money in my own name; and if my
      sister and I went on our knees to our father and asked him nicely, then
      perhaps he would forgive us; and we ought to pray to the Holy Mother to
      intercede for us....
    

      "Now, sir, go and talk to him," she said, when we heard my father's cough.
      "Go, speak to him, and beg his pardon. He won't bite your head off."
    

      I went in. My father was sitting at his desk working on the plan of a
      bungalow with Gothic windows and a stumpy tower like the lookout of a
      fire-station—an immensely stiff and inartistic design. As I entered
      the study I stood so that I could not help seeing the plan. I did not know
      why I had come to my father, but I remember that when I saw his thin face,
      red neck, and his shadow on the wall, I wanted to throw my arms round him
      and, as Akhsinya had bid me, to beg his pardon humbly; but the sight of
      the bungalow with the Gothic windows and the stumpy tower stopped me.
    

      "Good evening," I said.
    

      He glanced at me and at once cast his eyes down on his plan.
    

      "What do you want?" he asked after a while.
    

      "I came to tell you that my sister is very ill. She is dying," I said
      dully.
    

      "Well?" My father sighed, took off his spectacles and laid them on the
      table. "As you have sown, so you must reap. I want you to remember how you
      came to me two years ago, and on this very spot I asked you to give up
      your delusions, and I reminded you of your honour, your duty, your
      obligations to your ancestors, whose traditions must be kept sacred. Did
      you listen to me? You spurned my advice and clung to your wicked opinions;
      furthermore, you dragged your sister into your abominable delusions and
      brought about her downfall and her shame. Now you are both suffering for
      it. As you have sown, so you must reap."
    

      He paced up and down the study as he spoke. Probably he thought that I had
      come to him to admit that I was wrong, and probably he was waiting for me
      to ask his help for my sister and myself. I was cold, but I shook as
      though I were in a fever, and I spoke with difficulty in a hoarse voice.
    

      "And I must ask you to remember," I said, "that on this very spot I
      implored you to try to understand me, to reflect, and to think what we
      were living for and to what end, and your answer was to talk about my
      ancestors and my grandfather who wrote verses. Now you are told that your
      only daughter is in a hopeless condition and you talk of ancestors and
      traditions!... And you can maintain such frivolity when death is near and
      you have only five or ten years left to live!"
    

      "Why did you come here?" asked my father sternly, evidently affronted at
      my reproaching him with frivolity.
    

      "I don't know. I love you. I am more sorry than I can say that we are so
      far apart. That is why I came. I still love you, but my sister has finally
      broken with you. She does not forgive you and will never forgive you. Your
      very name fills her with hatred of her past life."
    

      "And who is to blame?" cried my father. "You, you scoundrel!"
    

      "Yes. Say that I am to blame," I said. "I admit that I am to blame for
      many things, but why is your life, which you have tried to force on us, so
      tedious and frigid, and ungracious, why are there no people in any of the
      houses you have built during the last thirty years from whom I could learn
      how to live and how to avoid such suffering? These houses of yours are
      infernal dungeons in which mothers and daughters are persecuted, children
      are tortured.... My poor mother! My unhappy sister! One needs to drug
      oneself with vodka, cards, scandal; cringe, play the hypocrite, and go on
      year after year designing rotten houses, not to see the horror that lurks
      in them. Our town has been in existence for hundreds of years, and during
      the whole of that time it has not given the country one useful man—not
      one! You have strangled in embryo everything that was alive and joyous! A
      town of shopkeepers, publicans, clerks, and hypocrites, an aimless, futile
      town, and not a soul would be the worse if it were suddenly razed to the
      ground."
    

      "I don't want to hear you, you scoundrel," said my father, taking a ruler
      from his desk. "You are drunk! You dare come into your father's presence
      in such a state! I tell you for the last time, and you can tell this to
      your strumpet of a sister, that you will get nothing from me. I have torn
      my disobedient children out of my heart, and if they suffer through their
      disobedience and obstinacy I have no pity for them. You may go back where
      you came from! God has been pleased to punish me through you. I will
      humbly bear my punishment and, like Job, I find consolation in suffering
      and unceasing toil. You shall not cross my threshold until you have mended
      your ways. I am a just man, and everything I say is practical good sense,
      and if you had any regard for yourself, you would remember what I have
      said, and what I am saying now."
    

      I threw up my hands and went out; I do not remember what happened that
      night or next day.
    

      They say that I went staggering through the street without a hat, singing
      aloud, with crowds of little boys shouting after me:
    

      "Little Profit! Little Profit!"
    

      XX
    

      If I wanted to order a ring, I would have it inscribed: "Nothing passes."
      I believe that nothing passes without leaving some trace, and that every
      little step has some meaning for the present and the future life.
    

      What I lived through was not in vain. My great misfortunes, my patience,
      moved the hearts of the people of the town and they no longer call me
      "Little Profit," they no longer laugh at me and throw water over me as I
      walk through the market. They got used to my being a working man and see
      nothing strange in my carrying paint-pots and glazing windows; on the
      contrary, they give me orders, and I am considered a good workman and the
      best contractor, after Radish, who, though he recovered and still paints
      the cupolas of the church without scaffolding, is not strong enough to
      manage the men, and I have taken his place and go about the town touting
      for orders, and take on and sack the men, and lend money at exorbitant
      interest. And now that I am a contractor I can understand how it is
      possible to spend several days hunting through the town for slaters to
      carry out a trifling order. People are polite to me, and address me
      respectfully and give me tea in the houses where I work, and send the
      servant to ask me if I would like dinner. Children and girls often come
      and watch me with curious, sad eyes.
    

      Once I was working in the governor's garden, painting the summer-house
      marble. The governor came into the summer-house, and having nothing better
      to do, began to talk to me, and I reminded him how he had once sent for me
      to caution me. For a moment he stared at my face, opened his mouth like a
      round O, waved his hands, and said:
    

      "I don't remember."
    

      I am growing old, taciturn, crotchety, strict; I seldom laugh, and people
      say I am growing like Radish, and, like him, I bore the men with my
      aimless moralising.
    

      Maria Victorovna, my late wife, lives abroad, and her father is making a
      railway somewhere in the Eastern provinces and buying land there. Doctor
      Blagovo is also abroad. Dubechnia has passed to Mrs. Cheprakov, who bought
      it from the engineer after haggling him into a twenty-per-cent reduction
      in the price. Moissey walks about in a bowler hat; he often drives into
      town in a trap and stops outside the bank. People say he has already
      bought an estate on a mortgage, and is always inquiring at the bank about
      Dubechnia, which he also intends to buy. Poor Ivan Cheprakov used to hang
      about the town, doing nothing and drinking. I tried to give him a job in
      our business, and for a time he worked with us painting roofs and glazing,
      and he rather took to it, and, like a regular house-painter, he stole the
      oil, and asked for tips, and got drunk. But it soon bored him. He got
      tired of it and went back to Dubechnia, and some time later I was told by
      the peasants that he had been inciting them to kill Moissey one night and
      rob Mrs. Cheprakov.
    

      My father has got very old and bent, and just takes a little walk in the
      evening near his house.
    

      When we had the cholera, Prokofyi cured the shopkeepers with pepper-brandy
      and tar and took money for it, and as I read in the newspaper, he was
      flogged for libelling the doctors as he sat in his shop. His boy Nicolka
      died of cholera. Karpovna is still alive, and still loves and fears her
      Prokofyi. Whenever she sees me she sadly shakes her head and says with a
      sigh:
    

      "Poor thing. You are lost!"
    

      On week-days I am busy from early morning till late at night. And on
      Sundays and holidays I take my little niece (my sister expected a boy, but
      a girl was born) and go with her to the cemetery, where I stand or sit and
      look at the grave of my dear one, and tell the child that her mother is
      lying there.
    

      Sometimes I find Aniuta Blagovo by the grave. We greet each other and
      stand silently, or we talk of Cleopatra, and the child, and the sadness of
      this life. Then we leave the cemetery and walk in silence and she lags
      behind—on purpose, to avoid staying with me. The little girl,
      joyful, happy, with her eyes half-closed against the brilliant sunlight,
      laughs and holds out her little hands to her, and we stop and together we
      fondle the darling child.
    

      And when we reach the town, Aniuta Blagovo, blushing and agitated, says
      good-bye, and walks on alone, serious and circumspect.... And, to look at
      her, none of the passers-by could imagine that she had just been walking
      by my side and even fondling the child.
    



The Bet and Other Stories







      I
    

      It was a dark autumn night. The old banker was pacing from corner to
      corner of his study, recalling to his mind the party he gave in the autumn
      fifteen years ago. There were many clever people at the party and much
      interesting conversation. They talked among other things of capital
      punishment. The guests, among them not a few scholars and journalists, for
      the most part disapproved of capital punishment. They found it obsolete as
      a means of punishment, unfitted to a Christian State and immoral. Some of
      them thought that capital punishment should be replaced universally by
      life-imprisonment.
    

      "I don't agree with you," said the host. "I myself have experienced
      neither capital punishment nor life-imprisonment, but if one may judge a
      priori, then in my opinion capital punishment is more moral and more
      humane than imprisonment. Execution kills instantly, life-imprisonment
      kills by degrees. Who is the more humane executioner, one who kills you in
      a few seconds or one who draws the life out of you incessantly, for
      years?"
    

      "They're both equally immoral," remarked one of the guests, "because their
      purpose is the same, to take away life. The State is not God. It has no
      right to take away that which it cannot give back, if it should so
      desire."
    

      Among the company was a lawyer, a young man of about twenty-five. On being
      asked his opinion, he said:
    

      "Capital punishment and life-imprisonment are equally immoral; but if I
      were offered the choice between them, I would certainly choose the second.
      It's better to live somehow than not to live at all."
    

      There ensued a lively discussion. The banker who was then younger and more
      nervous suddenly lost his temper, banged his fist on the table, and
      turning to the young lawyer, cried out:
    

      "It's a lie. I bet you two millions you wouldn't stick in a cell even for
      five years."
    

      "If that's serious," replied the lawyer, "then I bet I'll stay not five
      but fifteen."
    

      "Fifteen! Done!" cried the banker. "Gentlemen, I stake two millions."
    

      "Agreed. You stake two millions, I my freedom," said the lawyer.
    

      So this wild, ridiculous bet came to pass. The banker, who at that time
      had too many millions to count, spoiled and capricious, was beside himself
      with rapture. During supper he said to the lawyer jokingly:
    

      "Come to your senses, young man, before it's too late. Two millions are
      nothing to me, but you stand to lose three or four of the best years of
      your life. I say three or four, because you'll never stick it out any
      longer. Don't forget either, you unhappy man, that voluntary is much
      heavier than enforced imprisonment. The idea that you have the right to
      free yourself at any moment will poison the whole of your life in the
      cell. I pity you."
    

      And now the banker pacing from corner to corner, recalled all this and
      asked himself:
    

      "Why did I make this bet? What's the good? The lawyer loses fifteen years
      of his life and I throw away two millions. Will it convince people that
      capital punishment is worse or better than imprisonment for life. No, No!
      all stuff and rubbish. On my part, it was the caprice of a well-fed man;
      on the lawyer's, pure greed of gold."
    

      He recollected further what happened after the evening party. It was
      decided that the lawyer must undergo his imprisonment under the strictest
      observation, in a garden-wing of the banker's house. It was agreed that
      during the period he would be deprived of the right to cross the
      threshold, to see living people, to hear human voices, and to receive
      letters and newspapers. He was permitted to have a musical instrument, to
      read books, to write letters, to drink wine and smoke tobacco. By the
      agreement he could communicate, but only in silence, with the outside
      world through a little window specially constructed for this purpose.
      Everything necessary, books, music, wine, he could receive in any quantity
      by sending a note through the window. The agreement provided for all the
      minutest details, which made the confinement strictly solitary, and it
      obliged the lawyer to remain exactly fifteen years from twelve o'clock of
      November 14th 1870 to twelve o'clock of November 14th 1885. The least
      attempt on his part to violate the conditions, to escape if only for two
      minutes before the time freed the banker from the obligation to pay him
      the two millions.
    

      During the first year of imprisonment, the lawyer, as far as it was
      possible to judge from his short notes, suffered terribly from loneliness
      and boredom. From his wing day and night came the sound of the piano. He
      rejected wine and tobacco. "Wine," he wrote, "excites desires, and desires
      are the chief foes of a prisoner; besides, nothing is more boring than to
      drink good wine alone," and tobacco spoils the air in his room. During the
      first year the lawyer was sent books of a light character; novels with a
      complicated love interest, stories of crime and fantasy, comedies, and so
      on.
    

      In the second year the piano was heard no longer and the lawyer asked only
      for classics. In the fifth year, music was heard again, and the prisoner
      asked for wine. Those who watched him said that during the whole of that
      year he was only eating, drinking, and lying on his bed. He yawned often
      and talked angrily to himself. Books he did not read. Sometimes at nights
      he would sit down to write. He would write for a long time and tear it all
      up in the morning. More than once he was heard to weep.
    

      In the second half of the sixth year, the prisoner began zealously to
      study languages, philosophy, and history. He fell on these subjects so
      hungrily that the banker hardly had time to get books enough for him. In
      the space of four years about six hundred volumes were bought at his
      request. It was while that passion lasted that the banker received the
      following letter from the prisoner: "My dear gaoler, I am writing these
      lines in six languages. Show them to experts. Let them read them. If they
      do not find one single mistake, I beg you to give orders to have a gun
      fired off in the garden. By the noise I shall know that my efforts have
      not been in vain. The geniuses of all ages and countries speak in
      different languages; but in them all burns the same flame. Oh, if you knew
      my heavenly happiness now that I can understand them!" The prisoner's
      desire was fulfilled. Two shots were fired in the garden by the banker's
      order.
    

      Later on, after the tenth year, the lawyer sat immovable before his table
      and read only the New Testament. The banker found it strange that a man
      who in four years had mastered six hundred erudite volumes, should have
      spent nearly a year in reading one book, easy to understand and by no
      means thick. The New Testament was then replaced by the history of
      religions and theology.
    

      During the last two years of his confinement the prisoner read an
      extraordinary amount, quite haphazard. Now he would apply himself to the
      natural sciences, then would read Byron or Shakespeare. Notes used to come
      from him in which he asked to be sent at the same time a book on
      chemistry, a text-book of medicine, a novel, and some treatise on
      philosophy or theology. He read as though he were swimming in the sea
      among the broken pieces of wreckage, and in his desire to save his life
      was eagerly grasping one piece after another.
    

      II
    

      The banker recalled all this, and thought:
    

      "To-morrow at twelve o'clock he receives his freedom. Under the agreement,
      I shall have to pay him two millions. If I pay, it's all over with me. I
      am ruined for ever...."
    

      Fifteen years before he had too many millions to count, but now he was
      afraid to ask himself which he had more of, money or debts. Gambling on
      the Stock-Exchange, risky speculation, and the recklessness of which he
      could not rid himself even in old age, had gradually brought his business
      to decay; and the fearless, self-confident, proud man of business had
      become an ordinary banker, trembling at every rise and fall in the market.
    

      "That cursed bet," murmured the old man clutching his head in despair....
      "Why didn't the man die? He's only forty years old. He will take away my
      last farthing, marry, enjoy life, gamble on the Exchange, and I will look
      on like an envious beggar and hear the same words from him every day: 'I'm
      obliged to you for the happiness of my life. Let me help you.' No, it's
      too much! The only escape from bankruptcy and disgrace—is that the
      man should die."
    

      The clock had just struck three. The banker was listening. In Ike house
      everyone was asleep, and one could hear only the frozen trees whining
      outside the windows. Trying to make no sound, he took out of his safe the
      key of the door which had not been opened for fifteen years, put on his
      overcoat, and went out of the house. The garden was dark and cold. It was
      raining. A keen damp wind hovered howling over all the garden and gave the
      trees no rest. Though he strained his eyes, the banker could see neither
      the ground, nor the white statues, nor the garden-wing, nor the trees.
      Approaching the place where the garden wing stood, he called the watchman
      twice. There was no answer. Evidently the watchman had taken shelter from
      the bad weather and was now asleep somewhere in the kitchen or the
      greenhouse.
    

      "If I have the courage to fulfil my intention," thought the old man, "the
      suspicion will fall on the watchman first of all."
    

      In the darkness he groped for the stairs and the door and entered the hall
      of the gardenwing, then poked his way into a narrow passage and struck a
      match. Not a soul was there. Someone's bed, with no bedclothes on it,
      stood there, and an iron stove was dark in the corner. The seals on the
      door that led into the prisoner's room were unbroken.
    

      When the match went out, the old man, trembling from agitation, peeped
      into the little window.
    

      In the prisoner's room a candle was burning dim. The prisoner himself sat
      by the table. Only his back, the hair on his head and his hands were
      visible. On the table, the two chairs, the carpet by the table open books
      were strewn.
    

      Five minutes passed and the prisoner never once stirred. Fifteen years
      confinement had taught him to sit motionless. The banker tapped on the
      window with his finger, but the prisoner gave no movement in reply. Then
      the banker cautiously tore the seals from the door and put the key into
      the lock. The rusty lock gave a hoarse groan and the door creaked. The
      banker expected instantly to hear a cry of surprise and the sound of
      steps. Three minutes passed and it was as quiet behind the door as it had
      been before. He made up his mind to enter. Before the table sat a man,
      unlike an ordinary human being. It was a skeleton, with tight-drawn skin,
      with a woman's long curly hair, and a shaggy beard. The colour of his face
      was yellow, of an earthy shade; the cheeks were sunken, the back long and
      narrow, and the hand upon which he leaned his hairy head was so lean and
      skinny that it was painful to look upon. His hair was already silvering
      with grey, and no one who glanced at the senile emaciation of the face
      would have believed that he was only forty years old. On the table, before
      his bended head, lay a sheet of paper on which something was written in a
      tiny hand.
    

      "Poor devil," thought the banker, "he's asleep and probably seeing
      millions in his dreams. I have only to take and throw this half-dead thing
      on the bed, smother him a moment with the pillow, and the most careful
      examination will find no trace of unnatural death. But, first, let us read
      what he has written here."
    

      The banker took the sheet from the table and read:
    

      "To-morrow at twelve o'clock midnight, I shall obtain my freedom and the
      right to mix with people. But before I leave this room and see the sun I
      think it necessary to say a few words to you. On my own clear conscience
      and before God who sees me I declare to you that I despise freedom, life,
      health, and all that your books call the blessings of the world.
    

      "For fifteen years I have diligently studied earthly life. True, I saw
      neither the earth nor the people, but in your books I drank fragrant wine,
      sang songs, hunted deer and wild boar in the forests, loved women.... And
      beautiful women, like clouds ethereal, created by the magic of your poets'
      genius, visited me by night and whispered me wonderful tales, which made
      my head drunken. In your books I climbed the summits of Elbruz and Mont
      Blanc and saw from thence how the sun rose in the morning, and in the
      evening overflowed the sky, the ocean and the mountain ridges with a
      purple gold. I saw from thence how above me lightnings glimmered cleaving
      the clouds; I saw green forests, fields, rivers, lakes, cities; I heard
      syrens singing, and the playing of the pipes of Pan; I touched the wings
      of beautiful devils who came flying to me to speak of God.... In your
      books I cast myself into bottomless abysses, worked miracles, burned
      cities to the ground, preached new religions, conquered whole
      countries....
    

      "Your books gave me wisdom. All that unwearying human thought created in
      the centuries is compressed to a little lump in my skull. I know that I am
      more clever than you all.
    

      "And I despise your books, despise all wordly blessings and wisdom.
      Everything is void, frail, visionary and delusive like a mirage. Though
      you be proud and wise and beautiful, yet will death wipe you from the face
      of the earth like the mice underground; and your posterity, your history,
      and the immortality of your men of genius will be as frozen slag, burnt
      down together with the terrestrial globe.
    

      "You are mad, and gone the wrong way. You take lie for truth and ugliness
      for beauty. You would marvel if by certain conditions there should
      suddenly grow on apple and orange trees, instead of fruit, frogs and
      lizards, and if roses should begin to breathe the odour of a sweating
      horse. So do I marvel at you, who have bartered heaven for earth. I do not
      want to understand you.
    

      "That I may show you in deed my contempt for that by which you live, I
      waive the two millions of which I once dreamed as of paradise, and which I
      now despise. That I may deprive myself of my right to them, I shall come
      out from here five minutes before the stipulated term, and thus shall
      violate the agreement."
    

      When he had read, the banker put the sheet on the table, kissed the head
      of the strange man, and began to weep. He went out of the wing. Never at
      any other time, not even after his terrible losses on the Exchange, had he
      felt such contempt for himself as now. Coming home, he lay down on his
      bed, but agitation and tears kept him long from sleep....
    

      The next morning the poor watchman came running to him and told him that
      they had seen the man who lived in the wing climbing through the window
      into the garden. He had gone to the gate and disappeared. Together with
      his servants the banker went instantly to the wing and established the
      escape of his prisoner. To avoid unnecessary rumours he took the paper
      with the renunciation from the table and, on his return, locked it in his
      safe.
    





      (FROM AN OLD MAN'S JOURNAL)
    

      I
    

      There lives in Russia an emeritus professor, Nicolai Stiepanovich ...
      privy councillor and knight. He has so many Russian and foreign Orders
      that when he puts them on the students call him "the holy picture." His
      acquaintance is most distinguished. Not a single famous scholar lived or
      died during the last twenty-five or thirty years but he was intimately
      acquainted with him. Now he has no one to be friendly with, but speaking
      of the past the long list of his eminent friends would end with such names
      as Pirogov, Kavelin, and the poet Nekrasov, who bestowed upon him their
      warmest and most sincere friendship. He is a member of all the Russian and
      of three foreign universities, et cetera, et cetera. All this, and a great
      deal besides, forms what is known as my name.
    

      This name of mine is very popular. It is known to every literate person in
      Russia; abroad it is mentioned from professorial chairs with the epithets
      "eminent and esteemed." It is reckoned among those fortunate names which
      to mention in vain or to abuse in public or in the Press is considered a
      mark of bad breeding. Indeed, it should be so; because with my name is
      inseparably associated the idea of a famous, richly gifted, and
      indubitably useful person. I am a steady worker, with the endurance of a
      camel, which is important. I am also endowed with talent, which is still
      more important. In passing, I would add that I am a well-educated, modest,
      and honest fellow. I have never poked my nose into letters or politics,
      never sought popularity in disputes with the ignorant, and made no
      speeches either at dinners or at my colleagues' funerals. Altogether there
      is not a single spot on my learned name, and it has nothing to complain
      of. It is fortunate.
    

      The bearer of this name, that is myself, is a man of sixty-two, with a
      bald head, false teeth and an incurable tic. My name is as brilliant and
      prepossessing, as I, myself am dull and ugly. My head and hands tremble
      from weakness; my neck, like that of one of Turgeniev's heroines,
      resembles the handle of a counter-bass; my chest is hollow and my back
      narrow. When I speak or read my mouth twists, and when I smile my whole
      face is covered with senile, deathly wrinkles. There is nothing imposing
      in my pitiable face, save that when I suffer from the tic, I have a
      singular expression which compels anyone who looks at me to think: "This
      man will die soon, for sure."
    

      I can still read pretty well; I can still hold the attention of my
      audience for two hours. My passionate manner, the literary form of my
      exposition and my humour make the defects of my voice almost unnoticeable,
      though it is dry, harsh, and hard like a hypocrite's. But I write badly.
      The part of my brain which governs the ability to write refused office. My
      memory has weakened, and my thoughts are too inconsequent; and when I
      expound them on paper, I always have a feeling that I have lost the sense
      of their organic connection. The construction is monotonous, and the
      sentence feeble and timid. I often do not write what I want to, and when I
      write the end I cannot remember the beginning. I often forget common
      words, and in writing a letter I always have to waste much energy in order
      to avoid superfluous sentences and unnecessary incidental statements; both
      bear clear witness of the decay of my intellectual activity. And it is
      remarkable that, the simpler the letter, the more tormenting is my effort.
      When writing a scientific article I fed much freer and much more
      intelligent than in writing a letter of welcome or a report. One thing
      more: it is easier for me to write German or English than Russian.
    

      As regards my present life, I must first of all note insomnia, from which
      I have begun to suffer lately. If I were asked: "What is now the chief and
      fundamental fact of your existence?" I would answer: "Insomnia." From
      habit, I still undress at midnight precisely and get into bed. I soon fall
      asleep but wake just after one with the feeling that I have not slept at
      all. I must get out of bed and light the lamp. For an hour or two I walk
      about the room from corner to corner and inspect the long familiar
      pictures. When I am weary of walking I sit down to the table. I sit
      motionless thinking of nothing, feeling no desires; if a book lies before
      me I draw it mechanically towards me and read without interest. Thus
      lately in one night I read mechanically a whole novel with a strange
      title, "Of What the Swallow Sang." Or in order to occupy my attention I
      make myself count to a thousand, or I imagine the face of some one of my
      friends, and begin to remember in what year and under what circumstances
      he joined the faculty. I love to listen to sounds. Now, two rooms away
      from me my daughter Liza will say something quickly, in her sleep; then my
      wife will walk through the drawing-room with a candle and infallibly drop
      the box of matches. Then the shrinking wood of the cupboard squeaks or the
      burner of the lamp tinkles suddenly, and all these sounds somehow agitate
      me.
    

      Not to sleep of nights confesses one abnormal; and therefore I wait
      impatiently for the morning and the day, when I have the right not to
      sleep. Many oppressive hours pass before the cock crows. He is my
      harbinger of good. As soon as he has crowed I know that in an hour's time
      the porter downstairs will awake and for some reason or other go up the
      stairs, coughing angrily; and later beyond the windows the air begins to
      pale gradually and voices echo in the street.
    

      The day begins with the coming of my wife. She comes in to me in a
      petticoat, with her hair undone, but already washed and smelling of eau de
      Cologne, and looking as though she came in by accident, saying the same
      thing every time: "Pardon, I came in for a moment. You haven't slept
      again?" Then she puts the lamp out, sits by the table and begins to talk.
      I am not a prophet but I know beforehand what the subject of conversation
      will be, every morning the same. Usually, after breathless inquiries after
      my health, she suddenly remembers our son, the officer, who is serving in
      Warsaw. On the twentieth of each month we send him fifty roubles. This is
      our chief subject of conversation.
    

      "Of course it is hard on us," my wife sighs. "But until he is finally
      settled we are obliged to help him. The boy is among strangers; the pay is
      small. But if you like, next month we'll send him forty roubles instead of
      fifty. What do you think?"
    

      Daily experience might have convinced my wife that expenses do not grow
      less by talking of them. But my wife does not acknowledge experience and
      speaks about our officer punctually every day, about bread, thank Heaven,
      being cheaper and sugar a half-penny dearer—and all this in a tone
      as though it were news to me.
    

      I listen and agree mechanically. Probably because I have not slept during
      the night strange idle thoughts take hold of me. I look at my wife and
      wonder like a child. In perplexity I ask myself: This old, stout, clumsy
      woman, with sordid cares and anxiety about bread and butter written in the
      dull expression of her face, her eyes tired with eternal thoughts of debts
      and poverty, who can talk only of expenses and smile only when things are
      cheap—was this once the slim Varya whom I loved passionately for her
      fine clear mind, her pure soul, her beauty, and as Othello loved
      Desdemona, for her "compassion" of my science? Is she really the same, my
      wife Varya, who bore me a son?
    

      I gaze intently into the fat, clumsy old woman's face. I seek in her my
      Varya; but from the past nothing remains but her fear for my health and
      her way of calling my salary "our" salary and my hat "our" hat. It pains
      me to look at her, and to console her, if only a little, I let her talk as
      she pleases, and I am silent even when she judges people unjustly, or
      scolds me because I do not practise and do not publish text-books.
    

      Our conversation always ends in the same way. My wife suddenly remembers
      that I have not yet had tea, and gives a start:
    

      "Why am I sitting down?" she says, getting up. "The samovar has been on
      the table a long while, and I sit chatting. How forgetful I am? Good
      gracious!"
    

      She hurries away, but stops at the door to say:
    

      "We owe Yegor five months' wages. Do you realise it? It's a bad thing to
      let the servants' wages run on. I've said so often. It's much easier to
      pay ten roubles every month than fifty for five!"
    

      Outside the door she stops again:
    

      "I pity our poor Liza more than anybody. The girl studies at the
      Conservatoire. She's always in good society, and the Lord only knows how
      she's dressed. That fur-coat of hers! It's a sin to show yourself in the
      street in it. If she had a different father, it would do, but everyone
      knows he is a famous professor, a privy councillor."
    

      So, having reproached me for my name and title, she goes away at last.
      Thus begins my day. It does not improve.
    

      When I have drunk my tea, Liza comes in, in a fur-coat and hat, with her
      music, ready to go to the Conservatoire. She is twenty-two. She looks
      younger. She is pretty, rather like my wife when she was young. She kisses
      me tenderly on my forehead and my hand.
    

      "Good morning, Papa. Quite well?"
    

      As a child she adored ice-cream, and I often had to take her to a
      confectioner's. Ice-cream was her standard of beauty. If she wanted to
      praise me, she used to say: "Papa, you are ice-creamy." One finger she
      called the pistachio, the other the cream, the third the raspberry finger
      and so on. And when she came to say good morning, I used to lift her on to
      my knees and kiss her fingers, and say:
    

      "The cream one, the pistachio one, the lemon one."
    

      And now from force of habit I kiss Liza's fingers and murmur:
    

      "Pistachio one, cream one, lemon one." But it does not sound the same. I
      am cold like the ice-cream and I feel ashamed. When my daughter comes in
      and touches my forehead with her lips I shudder as though a bee had stung
      my forehead, I smile constrainedly and turn away my face. Since my
      insomnia began a question has been driving like a nail into my brain. My
      daughter continually sees how terribly I, an old man, blush because I owe
      the servant his wages; she sees how often the worry of small debts forces
      me to leave my work and to pace the room from corner to corner for hours,
      thinking; but why hasn't she, even once, come to me without telling her
      mother and whispered: "Father, here's my watch, bracelets, earrings,
      dresses.... Pawn them all.... You need money"? Why, seeing how I and her
      mother try to hide our poverty, out of false pride—why does she not
      deny herself the luxury of music lessons? I would not accept the watch,
      the bracelets, or her sacrifices—God forbid!—I do not want
      that.
    

      Which reminds me of my son, the Warsaw officer. He is a clever, honest,
      and sober fellow. But that doesn't mean very much. If I had an old father,
      and I knew that there were moments when he was ashamed of his poverty, I
      think I would give up my commission to someone else and hire myself out as
      a navvy. These thoughts of the children poison me. What good are they?
      Only a mean and irritable person Can take refuge in thinking evil of
      ordinary people because they are not heroes. But enough of that.
    

      At a quarter to ten I have to go and lecture to my dear boys. I dress
      myself and walk the road I have known these thirty years. For me it has a
      history of its own. Here is a big grey building with a chemist's shop
      beneath. A tiny house once stood there, and it was a beer-shop. In this
      beer-shop I thought out my thesis, and wrote my first love-letter to
      Varya. I wrote it in pencil on a scrap of paper that began "Historia
      Morbi." Here is a grocer's shop. It used to belong to a little Jew who
      sold me cigarettes on credit, and later on to a fat woman who loved
      students "because every one of them had a mother." Now a red-headed
      merchant sits there, a very nonchalant man, who drinks tea from a copper
      tea-pot. And here are the gloomy gates of the University that have not
      been repaired for years; a weary porter in a sheepskin coat, a broom,
      heaps of snow ... Such gates cannot produce a good impression on a boy who
      comes fresh from the provinces and imagines that the temple of science is
      really a temple. Certainly, in the history of Russian pessimism, the age
      of university buildings, the dreariness of the corridors, the smoke-stains
      on the walls, the meagre light, the dismal appearance of the stairs, the
      clothes-pegs and the benches, hold one of the foremost places in the
      series of predisposing causes. Here is our garden. It does not seem to
      have grown any better or any worse since I was a student. I do not like
      it. It would be much more sensible if tall pine-trees and fine oaks grew
      there instead of consumptive lime-trees, yellow acacias and thin clipped
      lilac. The student's mood is created mainly by every one of the
      surroundings in which he studies; therefore he must see everywhere before
      him only what is great and strong and exquisite. Heaven preserve him from
      starveling trees, broken windows, and drab walls and doors covered with
      tom oilcloth.
    

      As I approach my main staircase the door is open wide. I am met by my old
      friend, of the same age and name as I, Nicolas the porter. He grunts as he
      lets me in:
    

      "It's frosty, Your Excellency."
    

      Or if my coat is wet:
    

      "It's raining a bit, Your Excellency."
    

      Then he runs in front of me and opens all the doors on my way. In the
      study he carefully takes off my coat and at the same time manages to tell
      me some university news. Because of the close acquaintance that exists
      between all the University porters and keepers, he knows all that happens
      in the four faculties, in the registry, in the chancellor's cabinet, and
      the library. He knows everything. When, for instance, the resignation of
      the rector or dean is under discussion, I hear him talking to the junior
      porters, naming candidates and explaining offhand that so and so will not
      be approved by the Minister, so and so will himself refuse the honour;
      then he plunges into fantastic details of some mysterious papers received
      in the registry, of a secret conversation which appears to have taken
      place between the Minister and the curator, and so on. These details
      apart, he is almost always right. The impressions he forms of each
      candidate are original, but also true. If you want to know who read his
      thesis, joined the staff, resigned or died in a particular year, then you
      must seek the assistance of this veteran's colossal memory. He will not
      only name you the year, month, and day, but give you the accompanying
      details of this or any other event. Such memory is the privilege of love.
    

      He is the guardian of the university traditions. From the porters before
      him he inherited many legends of the life of the university. He added to
      this wealth much of his own and if you like he will tell you many stories,
      long or short. He can tell you of extraordinary savants who knew everything,
      of remarkable scholars who did not sleep for weeks on end, of numberless
      martyrs to science; good triumphs over evil with him. The weak always
      conquer the strong, the wise man the fool, the modest the proud, the young
      the old. There is no need to take all these legends and stories for
      sterling; but filter them, and you will find what you want in your filter,
      a noble tradition and the names of true heroes acknowledged by all.
    

      In our society all the information about the learned world consists
      entirely of anecdotes of the extraordinary absent-mindedness of old
      professors, and of a handful of jokes, which are ascribed to Guber or to
      myself or to Baboukhin. But this is too little for an educated society. If
      it loved science, savants and students as Nicolas loves them, it would
      long ago have had a literature of whole epics, stories, and biographies.
      But unfortunately this is yet to be.
    

      The news told, Nicolas looks stem and we begin to talk business. If an
      outsider were then to hear how freely Nicolas uses the jargon, he would be
      inclined to think that he was a scholar, posing as a soldier. By the way,
      the rumours of the university-porter's erudition are very exaggerated. It
      is true that Nicolas knows more than a hundred Latin tags, can put a
      skeleton together and on occasion make a preparation, can make the
      students laugh with a long learned quotation, but the simple theory of the
      circulation of the blood is as dark to him now as it was twenty years ago.
    

      At the table in my room, bent low over a book or a preparation, sits my
      dissector, Peter Ignatievich. He is a hardworking, modest man of
      thirty-five without any gifts, already bald and with a big belly. He works
      from morning to night, reads tremendously and remembers everything he has
      read. In this respect he is not merely an excellent man, but a man of
      gold; but in all others he is a cart-horse, or if you like a learned
      blockhead. The characteristic traits of a cart-horse which distinguish him
      from a creature of talent are these. His outlook is narrow, absolutely
      bounded by his specialism. Apart from his own subject he is as naive as a
      child. I remember once entering the room and saying:
    

      "Think what bad luck! They say, Skobielev is dead."
    

      Nicolas crossed himself; but Peter Ignatievich turned to me:
    

      "Which Skobielev do you mean?"
    

      Another time,—some time earlier—I announced that Professor
      Pierov was dead. That darling Peter Ignatievich asked:
    

      "What was his subject?"
    

      I imagine that if Patti sang into his ear, or Russia were attacked by
      hordes of Chinamen, or there was an earthquake, he would not lift a
      finger, but would go on in the quietest way with his eye screwed over his
      microscope. In a word: "What's Hecuba to him?" I would give anything to
      see how this dry old stick goes to bed with his wife.
    

      Another trait: a fanatical belief in the infallibility of science, above
      all in everything that the Germans write. He is sure of himself and his
      preparations, knows the purpose of life, is absolutely ignorant of the
      doubts and disillusionments that turn talents grey,—a slavish
      worship of the authorities, and not a shadow of need to think for himself.
      It is hard to persuade him and quite impossible to discuss with him. Just
      try a discussion with a man who is profoundly convinced that the best
      science is medicine, the best men doctors, the best traditions—the
      medical! From the ugly past of medicine only one tradition has survived,—the
      white necktie that doctors wear still. For a learned, and more generally
      for an educated person there can exist only a general university
      tradition, without any division into traditions of medicine, of law, and
      so on. But it's quite impossible for Peter Ignatievich to agree with that;
      and he is ready to argue it with you till doomsday.
    

      His future is quite plain to me. During the whole of his life he will make
      several hundred preparations of extraordinary purity, will write any
      number of dry, quite competent, essays, will make about ten scrupulously
      accurate translations; but he won't invent gunpowder. For gunpowder,
      imagination is wanted, inventiveness, and a gift for divination, and Peter
      Ignatievich has nothing of the kind. In short, he is not a master of
      science but a labourer.
    

      Peter Ignatievich, Nicolas, and I whisper together. We are rather strange
      to ourselves. One feels something quite particular, when the audience
      booms like the sea behind the door. In thirty years I have not grown used
      to this feeling, and I have it every morning. I button up my frock-coat
      nervously, ask Nicolas unnecessary questions, get angry.... It is as
      though I were afraid; but it is not fear, but something else which I
      cannot name nor describe.
    

      Unnecessarily, I look at my watch and say:
    

      "Well, it's time to go."
    

      And we march in, in this order: Nicolas with the preparations or the
      atlases in front, myself next, and after me, the cart-horse, modestly
      hanging his head; or, if necessary, a corpse on a stretcher in front and
      behind the corpse Nicolas and so on. The students rise when I appear, then
      sit down and the noise of the sea is suddenly still. Calm begins.
    

      I know what I will lecture about, but I know nothing of how I will
      lecture, where I will begin and where I will end. There is not a single
      sentence ready in my brain. But as soon as I glance at the audience,
      sitting around me in an amphitheatre, and utter the stereotyped "In our
      last lecture we ended with...." and the sentences fly out of my soul in a
      long line—then it is full steam ahead. I speak with irresistible
      speed, and with passion, and it seems as though no earthly power could
      check the current of my speech. In order to lecture well, that is without
      being wearisome and to the listener's profit, besides talent you must have
      the knack of it and experience; you must have a clear idea both of your
      own powers, of the people to whom you are lecturing, and of the subject of
      your remarks. Moreover, you must be quick in the uptake, keep a sharp eye
      open, and never for a moment lose your field of vision.
    

      When he presents the composer's thought, a good conductor does twenty
      things at once. He reads the score, waves his baton, watches the singer
      makes a gesture now towards the drum, now to the double-bass, and so on.
      It is the same with me when lecturing. I have some hundred and fifty faces
      before me, quite unlike each other, and three hundred eyes staring me
      straight in the face. My purpose is to conquer this many-headed hydra. If
      I have a clear idea how far they are attending and how much they are
      comprehending every minute while I am lecturing, then the hydra is in my
      power. My other opponent is within me. This is the endless variety of
      forms, phenomena and laws, and the vast number of ideas, whether my own or
      others', which depend upon them. Every moment I must be skilful enough to
      choose what is most important and necessary from this enormous material,
      and just as swiftly as my speech flows to clothe my thought in a form
      which will penetrate the hydra's understanding and excite its attention.
      Besides I must watch carefully to see that my thoughts shall not be
      presented as they have been accumulated, but in a certain order, necessary
      for the correct composition of the picture which I wish to paint. Further,
      I endeavour to make my speech literary, my definitions brief and exact, my
      sentences as simple and elegant as possible. Every moment I must hold
      myself in and remember that I have only an hour and forty minutes to
      spend. In other words, it is a heavy labour. At one and the same time you
      have to be a savant, a schoolmaster, and an orator, and it is a failure if
      the orator triumphs over the schoolmaster in you or the schoolmaster over
      the orator.
    

      After lecturing for a quarter, for half an hour, I notice suddenly that
      the students have begun to stare at the ceiling or Peter Ignatievich. One
      will feel for his handkerchief, another settle himself comfortably,
      another smile at his own thoughts. This means their attention is tried. I
      must take steps. I seize the first opening and make a pun. All the hundred
      and fifty faces have a broad smile, their eyes flash merrily, and for a
      while you can hear the boom of the sea. I laugh too. Their attention is
      refreshed and I can go on.
    

      No sport, no recreation, no game ever gave me such delight as reading a
      lecture. Only in a lecture could I surrender myself wholly to passion and
      understand that inspiration is not a poet's fiction, but exists indeed.
      And I do not believe that Hercules, even after the most delightful of his
      exploits, felt such a pleasant weariness as I experienced every time after
      a lecture.
    

      This was in the past. Now at lectures I experience only torture. Not half
      an hour passes before I begin to feel an invincible weakness in my legs
      and shoulders. I sit down in my chair, but I am not used to lecture
      sitting. In a moment I am up again, and lecture standing. Then I sit down
      again. Inside my mouth is dry, my voice is hoarse, my head feels dizzy. To
      hide my state from my audience I drink some water now and then, cough,
      wipe my nose continually, as though I was troubled by a cold, make
      inopportune puns, and finally announce the interval earlier than I should.
      But chiefly I feel ashamed.
    

      Conscience and reason tell me that the best thing I could do now is to
      read my farewell lecture to the boys, give them my last word, bless them
      and give up my place to someone younger and stronger than I. But, heaven
      be my judge, I have not the courage to act up to my conscience.
    

      Unfortunately, I am neither philosopher nor theologian. I know quite well
      I have no more than six months to live; and it would seem that now I ought
      to be mainly occupied with questions of the darkness beyond the grave, and
      the visions which will visit my sleep in the earth. But somehow my soul is
      not curious of these questions, though my mind grants every atom of their
      importance. Now before my death it is just as it was twenty or thirty
      years ago. Only science interests me.—When I take my last breath I
      shall still believe that Science is the most important, the most
      beautiful, the most necessary thing in the life of man; that she has
      always been and always will be the highest manifestation of love, and that
      by her alone will man triumph over nature and himself. This faith is,
      perhaps, at bottom naive and unfair, but I am not to blame if this and not
      another is my faith. To conquer this faith within me is for me impossible.
    

      But this is beside the point. I only ask that you should incline to my
      weakness and understand that to tear a man who is more deeply concerned
      with the destiny of a brain tissue than the final goal of creation away
      from his rostrum and his students is like taking him and nailing him up in
      a coffin without waiting until he is dead.
    

      Because of my insomnia and the intense struggle with my increasing
      weakness a strange thing happens inside me. In the middle of my lecture
      tears rise to my throat, my eyes begin to ache, and I have a passionate
      and hysterical desire to stretch out my hands and moan aloud. I want to
      cry out that fate has doomed me, a famous man, to death; that in some six
      months here in the auditorium another will be master. I want to cry out
      that I am poisoned; that new ideas that I did not know before have
      poisoned the last days of my life, and sting my brain incessantly like
      mosquitoes. At that moment my position seems so terrible to me that I want
      all my students to be terrified, to jump from their seats and rush
      panic-stricken to the door, shrieking in despair.
    

      It is not easy to live through such moments.
    


      II
    

      After the lecture I sit at home and work. I read reviews, dissertations,
      or prepare for the next lecture, and sometimes I write something. I work
      with interruptions, since I have to receive visitors.
    

      The bell rings. It is a friend who has come to talk over some business. He
      enters with hat and stick. He holds them both in front of him and says:
    

      "Just a minute, a minute. Sit down, cher confrÃ¨re. Only a word or two."
    

      First we try to show each other that we are both extraordinarily polite
      and very glad to see each other. I make him sit down in the chair, and he
      makes me sit down; and then we touch each other's waists, and put our
      hands on each other's buttons, as though we were feeling each other and
      afraid to bum ourselves. We both laugh, though we say nothing funny.
      Sitting down, we bend our heads together and begin to whisper to each
      other. We must gild our conversation with such Chinese formalities as:
      "You remarked most justly" or "I have already had the occasion to say." We
      must giggle if either of us makes a pun, though it's a bad one. When we
      have finished with the business, my friend gets up with a rush, waves his
      hat towards my work, and begins to take his leave. We feel each other once
      more and laugh. I accompany him down to the hall. There I help my friend
      on with his coat, but he emphatically declines so great an honour. Then,
      when Yegor opens the door my friend assures me that I will catch cold, and
      I pretend to be ready to follow him into the street. And when I finally
      return to my study my face keeps smiling still, it must be from inertia.
    

      A little later another ring. Someone enters the hall, spends a long time
      taking off his coat and coughs. Yegor brings me word that a student has
      come. I tell him to show him up. In a minute a pleasant-faced young man
      appears. For a year we have been on these forced terms together. He sends
      in abominable answers at examinations, and I mark him gamma. Every year I
      have about seven of these people to whom, to use the students' slang, "I
      give a plough" or "haul them through." Those of them who fail because of
      stupidity or illness, usually bear their cross in patience and do not
      bargain with me; only sanguine temperaments, "open natures," bargain with
      me and come to my house, people whose appetite is spoiled or who are
      prevented from going regularly to the opera by a delay in their
      examinations. With the first I am over-indulgent; the second kind I keep
      on the run for a year.
    

      "Sit down," I say to my guest. "What was it you wished to say?"
    

      "Forgive me for troubling you, Professor...." he begins, stammering and
      never looking me in the face. "I would not venture to trouble you
      unless.... I was up for my examination before you for the fifth time ...
      and I failed. I implore you to be kind, and give me a 'satis,'
      because...."
    

      The defence which all idlers make of themselves is always the same. They
      have passed in every other subject with distinction, and failed only in
      mine, which is all the more strange because they had always studied my
      subject most diligently and know it thoroughly. They failed through some
      inconceivable misunderstanding.
    

      "Forgive me, my friend," I say to my guest. "But I can't give you a
      'satis'—impossible. Go and read your lectures again, and then come.
      Then we'll see."
    

      Pause. I get a desire to torment the student a little, because he prefers
      beer and the opera to science; and I say with a sigh:
    

      "In my opinion, the best thing for you now is to give up the Faculty of
      Medicine altogether. With your abilities, if you find it impossible to
      pass the examination, then it seems you have neither the desire nor the
      vocation to be a doctor."
    

      My sanguine friend's face grows grave.
    

      "Excuse me, Professor," he smiles, "but it would be strange, to say the
      least, on my part. Studying medicine for five years and suddenly—to
      throw it over."
    

      "Yes, but it's better to waste five years than to spend your whole life
      afterwards in an occupation which you dislike."
    

      Immediately I begin to feel sorry for him and hasten to say:
    

      "Well, do as you please. Read a little and come again."
    

      "When?" the idler asks, dully.
    

      "Whenever you like. To-morrow, even."
    

      And I read in his pleasant eyes. "I can come again; but you'll send me
      away again, you beast."
    

      "Of course," I say, "you won't become more learned because you have to
      come up to me fifteen times for examination; but this will form your
      character. You must be thankful for that."
    

      Silence. I rise and wait for my guest to leave. But he stands there,
      looking at the window, pulling at his little beard and thinking. It
      becomes tedious.
    

      My sanguine friend has a pleasant, succulent voice, clever, amusing eyes,
      a good-natured face, rather puffed by assiduity to beer and much resting
      on the sofa. Evidently he could tell me many interesting things about the
      opera, about his love affairs, about the friends he adores; but,
      unfortunately, it is not the thing. And I would so eagerly listen!
    

      "On my word of honour, Professor, if you give me a 'satis' I'll...."
    

      As soon as it gets to "my word of honour," I wave my hands and sit down to
      the table. The student thinks for a while and says, dejectedly:
    

      "In that case, good-bye.... Forgive me!"
    

      "Good-bye, my friend.... Good-bye!"
    

      He walks irresolutely into the hall, slowly puts on his coat, and, when he
      goes into the street, probably thinks again for a long while; having
      excogitated nothing better than "old devil" for me, he goes to a cheap
      restaurant to drink beer and dine, and then home to sleep. Peace be to
      your ashes, honest labourer!
    

      A third ring. Enters a young doctor in a new black suit, gold-rimmed
      spectacles and the inevitable white necktie. He introduces himself. I ask
      him to take a seat and inquire his business. The young priest of science
      begins to tell me, not without agitation, that he passed his doctor's
      examination this year, and now has only to write his dissertation. He
      would like to work with me, under my guidance; and I would do him a great
      kindness if I would suggest a subject for his dissertation.
    

      "I should be delighted to be of use to you, mon cher confrÃ¨re," I say.
      "But first of all, let us come to an agreement as to what is a
      dissertation. Generally we understand by this, work produced as the result
      of an independent creative power. Isn't that so? But a work written on
      another's subject, under another's guidance, has a different name."
    

      The aspirant is silent. I fire up and jump out of my seat. "Why do you all
      come to me? I can't understand," I cry out angrily. "Do I keep a shop? I
      don't sell theses across the counter. For the one thousandth time I ask
      you all to leave me alone. Forgive my rudeness, but I've got tired of it
      at last!"
    

      The aspirant is silent. Only, a tinge of colour shows on his cheek. His
      face expresses his profound respect for my famous name and my erudition,
      but I see in his eyes that he despises my voice, my pitiable figure, my
      nervous gestures. When I am angry I seem to him a very queer fellow.
    

      "I do not keep a shop," I storm. "It's an amazing business! Why don't you
      want to be independent? Why do you find freedom so objectionable?"
    

      I say a great deal, but he is silent. At last by degrees I grow calm, and,
      of course, surrender. The aspirant will receive a valueless subject from
      me, will write under my observation a needless thesis, will pass his
      tedious disputation cum laude and will get a useless and learned
      degree.
    

      The rings follow in endless succession, but here I confine myself to four.
      The fourth ring sounds, and I hear the familiar steps, the rustling dress,
      the dear voice.
    

      Eighteen years ago my dear friend, the oculist, died and left behind him a
      seven year old daughter, Katy, and sixty thousand roubles. By his will he
      made me guardian. Katy lived in my family till she was ten. Afterwards she
      was sent to College and lived with me only in her holidays in the summer
      months. I had no time to attend to her education. I watched only by fits
      and starts; so that I can say very little about her childhood.
    

      The chief thing I remember, the one I love to dwell upon in memory, is the
      extraordinary confidence which she had when she entered my house, when she
      had to have the doctor,—a confidence which was always shining in her
      darling face. She would sit in a corner somewhere with her face tied up,
      and would be sure to be absorbed in watching something. Whether she was
      watching me write and read books, or my wife bustling about, or the cook
      peeling the potatoes in the kitchen or the dog playing about—her
      eyes invariably expressed the same thing: "Everything that goes on in this
      world,—everything is beautiful and clever." She was inquisitive and
      adored to talk to me. She would sit at the table opposite me, watching my
      movements and asking questions. She is interested to know what I read,
      what I do at the University, if I'm not afraid of corpses, what I do with
      my money.
    

      "Do the students fight at the University?" she would ask.
    

      "They do, my dear."
    

      "You make them go down on their knees?"
    

      "I do."
    

      And it seemed funny to her that the students fought and that I made them
      go down on their knees, and she laughed. She was a gentle, good, patient
      child.
    

      Pretty often I happened to see how something was taken away from her, or
      she was unjustly punished, or her curiosity was not satisfied. At such
      moments sadness would be added to her permanent expression of confidence—nothing
      more. I didn't know how to take her part, but when I saw her sadness, I
      always had the desire to draw her close to me and comfort her in an old
      nurse's voice: "My darling little orphan!"
    

      I remember too she loved to be well dressed and to sprinkle herself with
      scents. In this she was like me. I also love good clothes and fine scents.
    

      I regret that I had neither the time nor the inclination to watch the
      beginnings and the growth of the passion which had completely taken hold
      of Katy when she was no more than fourteen or fifteen. I mean her
      passionate love for the theatre. When she used to come from the College
      for her holidays and live with us, nothing gave her such pleasure and
      enthusiasm to talk about as plays and actors. She used to tire us with her
      incessant conversation about the theatre. I alone hadn't the courage to
      deny her my attention. My wife and children did not listen to her. When
      she felt the desire to share her raptures she would come to my study and
      coax: "Nicolai Stiepanich, do let me speak to you about the theatre."
    

      I used to show her the time and say:
    

      "I'll give you half an hour. Fire away!"
    

      Later on she used to bring in pictures of the actors and actresses she
      worshipped—whole dozens of them. Then several times she tried to
      take part in amateur theatricals, and finally when she left College she
      declared to me she was born to be an actress.
    

      I never shared Katy's enthusiasms for the theatre. My opinion is that if a
      play is good then there's no need to trouble the actors for it to make the
      proper impression; you can be satisfied merely by reading it. If the play
      is bad, no acting will make it good.
    

      When I was young I often went to the theatre, and nowadays my family takes
      a box twice a year and carries me off for an airing there. Of course this
      is not enough to give me the right to pass verdicts on the theatre; but I
      will say a few words about it. In my opinion the theatre hasn't improved
      in the last thirty or forty years. I can't find any more than I did then,
      a glass of dean water, either in the corridors or the foyer. Just as they
      did then, the attendants fine me sixpence for my coat, though there's
      nothing illegal in wearing a warm coat in winter. Just as it did then, the
      orchestra plays quite unnecessarily in the intervals, and adds a new,
      gratuitous impression to the one received from the play. Just as they did
      then, men go to the bar in the intervals and drink spirits. If there is no
      perceptible improvement in little things, it will be useless to look for
      it in the bigger things. When an actor, hide-bound in theatrical
      traditions and prejudices, tries to read simple straightforward monologue:
      "To be or not to be," not at all simply, but with an incomprehensible and
      inevitable hiss and convulsions over his whole body, or when he tries to
      convince me that Chazky, who is always talking to fools and is in love
      with a fool, is a very clever man and that "The Sorrows of Knowledge" is
      not a boring play,—then I get from the stage a breath of the same
      old routine that exasperated me forty years ago when I was regaled with
      classical lamentation and beating on the breast. Every time I come out of
      the theatre a more thorough conservative than I went in.
    

      It's quite possible to convince the sentimental, self-confident crowd that
      the theatre in its present state is an education. But not a man who knows
      what true education is would swallow this. I don't know what it may be in
      fifty or a hundred years, but under present conditions the theatre can
      only be a recreation. But the recreation is too expensive for continual
      use, and robs the country of thousands of young, healthy, gifted men and
      women, who if they had not devoted themselves to the theatre would be
      excellent doctors, farmers, schoolmistresses, or officers. It robs the
      public of its evenings, the best time for intellectual work and friendly
      conversation. I pass over the waste of money and the moral injuries to the
      spectator when he sees murder, adultery, or slander wrongly treated on the
      stage.
    

      But Katy's opinion was quite the opposite. She assured me that even in its
      present state the theatre is above lecture-rooms and books, above
      everything else in the world. The theatre is a power that unites in itself
      all the arts, and the actors are men with a mission. No separate art or
      science can act on the human soul so strongly and truly as the stage; and
      therefore it is reasonable that a medium actor should enjoy much greater
      popularity than the finest scholar or painter. No public activity can give
      such delight and satisfaction as the theatrical.
    

      So one fine day Katy joined a theatrical company and went away, I believe,
      to Ufa, taking with her a lot of money, a bagful of rainbow hopes, and
      some very high-class views on the business.
    

      Her first letters on the journey were wonderful. When I read them I was
      simply amazed that little sheets of paper could contain so much youth,
      such transparent purity, such divine innocence, and at the same time so
      many subtle, sensible judgments, that would do honour to a sound masculine
      intelligence. The Volga, nature, the towns she visited, her friends, her
      successes and failures—she did not write about them, she sang. Every
      line breathed the confidence which I used to see in her face; and with all
      this a mass of grammatical mistakes and hardly a single stop.
    

      Scarce six months passed before I received a highly poetical enthusiastic
      letter, beginning, "I have fallen in love." She enclosed a photograph of a
      young man with a clean-shaven face, in a broad-brimmed hat, with a plaid
      thrown over his shoulders. The next letters were just as splendid, but
      stops already began to appear and the grammatical mistakes to vanish. They
      had a strong masculine scent. Katy began to write about what a good thing
      it would be to build a big theatre somewhere in the Volga, but on a
      cooperative basis, and to attract the rich business-men and shipowners to
      the undertaking. There would be plenty of money, huge receipts, and the
      actors would work in partnership.... Perhaps all this is really a good
      thing, but I can't help thinking such schemes could only come from a man's
      head.
    

      Anyhow for eighteen months or a couple of years everything seemed to be
      all right. Katy was in love, had her heart in her business and was happy.
      But later on I began to notice dear symptoms of a decline in her letters.
      It began with Katy complaining about her friends. This is the first and
      most ominous sign. If a young scholar or litterateur begins his career by
      complaining bitterly about other scholars or littÃ©rateurs, it means that
      he is tired already and not fit for his business. Katy wrote to me that
      her friends would not come to rehearsals and never knew their parts; that
      they showed an utter contempt for the public in the absurd plays they
      staged and the manner they behaved. To swell the box-office receipts—the
      only topic of conversation—serious actresses degrade themselves by
      singing sentimentalities, and tragic actors sing music-hall songs,
      laughing at husbands who are deceived and unfaithful wives who are
      pregnant. In short, it was amazing that the profession, in the provinces,
      was not absolutely dead. The marvel was that it could exist at all with
      such thin, rotten blood in its veins.
    

      In reply I sent Katy a long and, I confess, a very tedious letter. Among
      other things I wrote: "I used to talk fairly often to actors in the past,
      men of the noblest character, who honoured me with their friendship. From
      my conversations with them I understood that their activities were guided
      rather by the whim and fashion of society than by the free working of
      their own minds. The best of them in their lifetime had to play in
      tragedy, in musical comedy, in French farce, and in pantomime; yet all
      through they considered that they were treading the right path and being
      useful. You see that this means that you must look for the cause of the
      evil, not in the actors, but deeper down, in the art itself and the
      attitude of society towards it." This letter of mine only made Katy cross.
      "You and I are playing in different operas. I didn't write to you about
      men of the noblest character, but about a lot of sharks who haven't a
      spark of nobility in them. They are a horde of savages who came on the
      stage only because they wouldn't be allowed anywhere else. The only ground
      they have for calling themselves artists is their impudence. Not a single
      talent among them, but any number of incapables, drunkards, intriguers,
      and slanderers. I can't tell you how bitterly I feel it that the art I
      love so much is fallen into the hands of people I despise. It hurts me
      that the best men should be content to look at evil from a distance and
      not want to come nearer. Instead of taking an active part, they write
      ponderous platitudes and useless sermons...." and more in the same strain.
    

      A little while after I received the following: "I have been inhumanly
      deceived. I can't go on living any more. Do as you think fit with my
      money. I loved you as a father and as my only friend. Forgive me."
    

      So it appeared that he too belonged to the horde of savages. Later
      on, I gathered from various hints, that there was an attempt at suicide.
      Apparently, Katy tried to poison herself. I think she must have been
      seriously ill afterwards, for I got the following letter from Yalta, where
      most probably the doctors had sent her. Her last letter to me contained a
      request that I should send her at Yalta a thousand roubles, and it ended
      with the words: "Forgive me for writing such a sad letter. I buried my
      baby yesterday." After she had spent about a year in the Crimea she
      returned home.
    

      She had been travelling for about four years, and during these four years
      I confess that I occupied a strange and unenviable position in regard to
      her. When she announced to me that she was going on to the stage and
      afterwards wrote to me about her love; when the desire to spend took hold
      of her, as it did periodically, and I had to send her every now and then
      one or two thousand roubles at her request; when she wrote that she
      intended to die, and afterwards that her baby was dead,—-I was at a
      loss every time. All my sympathy with her fate consisted in thinking hard
      and writing long tedious letters which might as well never have been
      written. But then I was in loco parentis and I loved her as a
      daughter.
    

      Katy lives half a mile away from me now. She took a five-roomed house and
      furnished it comfortably, with the taste that was born in her. If anyone
      were to undertake to depict her surroundings, then the dominating mood of
      the picture would be indolence. Soft cushions, soft chairs for her
      indolent body; carpets for her indolent feet; faded, dim, dull colours for
      her indolent eyes; for her indolent soul, a heap of cheap fans and tiny
      pictures on the walls, pictures in which novelty of execution was more
      noticeable than content; plenty of little tables and stands, set out with
      perfectly useless and worthless things, shapeless scraps instead of
      curtains.... All this, combined with a horror of bright colours, of
      symmetry, and space, betokened a perversion of the natural taste as well
      as indolence of the soul. For whole days Katy lies on the sofa and reads
      books, mostly novels and stories. She goes outside her house but once in
      the day, to come and see me.
    

      I work. Katy sits on the sofa at my side. She is silent, and wraps herself
      up in her shawl as though she were cold. Either because she is sympathetic
      to me, or I because I had got used to her continual visits while she was
      still a little girl, her presence does not prevent me from concentrating
      on my work. At long intervals I ask her some question or other,
      mechanically, and she answers very curtly; or, for a moment's rest, I turn
      towards her and watch how she is absorbed in looking through some medical
      review or newspaper. And then I see that the old expression of confidence
      in her face is there no more. Her expression now is cold, indifferent,
      distracted, like that of a passenger who has to wait a long while for his
      train. She dresses as she used—well and simply, but carelessly.
      Evidently her clothes and her hair suffer not a little from the sofas and
      hammocks on which she lies for days together. And she is not curious any
      more. She doesn't ask me questions any more, as if she had experienced
      everything in life and did not expect to hear anything new.
    

      About four o'clock there is a sound of movement in the hall and the
      drawing-room. It's Liza come back from the Conservatoire, bringing her
      friends with her. You can hear them playing the piano, trying their voices
      and giggling. Yegor is laying the table in the dining-room and making a
      noise with the plates.
    

      "Good-bye," says Katy. "I shan't go in to see your people. They must
      excuse me. I haven't time. Come and see me."
    

      When I escort her into the hall, she looks me over sternly from head to
      foot, and says in vexation:
    

      "You get thinner and thinner. Why don't you take a cure? I'll go to
      Sergius Fiodorovich and ask him to come. You must let him see you."
    

      "It's not necessary, Katy."
    

      "I can't understand why your family does nothing. They're a nice lot."
    

      She puts on her jacket with her rush. Inevitably, two or three hair-pins
      fall out of her careless hair on to the floor. It's too much bother to
      tidy her hair now; besides she is in a hurry. She pushes the straggling
      strands of hair untidily under her hat and goes away.
    

      As soon as I come into the dining-room, my wife asks:
    

      "Was that Katy with you just now? Why didn't she come to see us. It really
      is extraordinary...."
    

      "Mamma!" says Liza reproachfully, "If she doesn't want to come, that's her
      affair. There's no need for us to go on our knees."
    

      "Very well; but it's insulting. To sit in the study for three hours,
      without thinking of us. But she can do as she likes."
    

      Varya and Liza both hate Katy. This hatred is unintelligible to me;
      probably you have to be a woman to understand it. I'll bet my life on it
      that you'll hardly find a single one among the hundred and fifty young men
      I see almost every day in my audience, or the hundred old ones I happen to
      meet every week, who would be able to understand why women hate and abhor
      Katy's past, her being pregnant and unmarried and her illegitimate child.
      Yet at the same time I cannot bring to mind a single woman or girl of my
      acquaintance who would not cherish such feelings, either consciously or
      instinctively. And it's not because women are purer and more virtuous than
      men. If virtue and purity are not free from evil feeling, there's precious
      little difference between them and vice. I explain it simply by the
      backward state of women's development. The sorrowful sense of compassion
      and the torment of conscience, which the modern man experiences when he
      sees distress have much more to tell me about culture and moral
      development than have hatred and repulsion. The modern woman is as
      lachrymose and as coarse in heart as she was in the middle ages. And in my
      opinion those who advise her to be educated like a man have wisdom on
      their side.
    

      But still my wife does not like Katy, because she was an actress, and for
      her ingratitude, her pride, her extravagances, and all the innumerable
      vices one woman can always discover in another.
    

      Besides myself and my family we have two or three of my daughter's girl
      friends to dinner and Alexander Adolphovich Gnekker, Liza's admirer and
      suitor. He is a fair young man, not more than thirty years old, of middle
      height, very fat, broad shouldered, with reddish hair round his ears and a
      little stained moustache, which give his smooth chubby face the look of a
      doll's. He wears a very short jacket, a fancy waistcoat, large-striped
      trousers, very full on the hip and very narrow in the leg, and brown boots
      without heels. His eyes stick out like a lobster's, his tie is like a
      lobster's tail, and I can't help thinking even that the smell of lobster
      soup clings about the whole of this young man. He visits us every day; but
      no one in the family knows where he comes from, where he was educated, or
      how he lives. He cannot play or sing, but he has a certain connection with
      music as well as singing, for he is agent for somebody's pianos, and is
      often at the Academy. He knows all the celebrities, and he manages
      concerts. He gives his opinion on music with great authority and I have
      noticed that everybody hastens to agree with him.
    

      Rich men always have parasites about them. So do the sciences and the
      arts. It seems that there is no science or art in existence, which is free
      from such "foreign bodies" as this Mr. Gnekker. I am not a musician and
      perhaps I am mistaken about Gnekker, besides I don't know him very well.
      But I can't help suspecting the authority and dignity with which he stands
      beside the piano and listens when anyone is singing or playing.
    

      You may be a gentleman and a privy councillor a hundred times over; but if
      you have a daughter you can't be guaranteed against the pettinesses that
      are so often brought into your house and into your own humour, by
      courtings, engagements, and weddings. For instance, I cannot reconcile
      myself to my wife's solemn expression every time Gnekker comes to our
      house, nor to those bottles of ChÃ¢teau Lafitte, port, and sherry which are
      put on the table only for him, to convince him beyond doubt of the
      generous luxury in which we live. Nor can I stomach the staccato laughter
      which Liza learned at the Academy, and her way of screwing up her eyes,
      when men are about the house. Above all, I can't understand why it is that
      such a creature should come to me every day and have dinner with me—a
      creature perfectly foreign to my habits, my science, and the whole tenour
      of my life, a creature absolutely unlike the men I love. My wife and the
      servants whisper mysteriously that that is "the bridegroom," but still I
      can't understand why he's there. It disturbs my mind just as much as if a
      Zulu were put next to me at table. Besides, it seems strange to me that my
      daughter whom I used to think of as a baby should be in love with that
      necktie, those eyes, those chubby cheeks.
    

      Formerly, I either enjoyed my dinner or was indifferent about it. Now it
      does nothing but bore and exasperate me. Since I was made an Excellency
      and Dean of the Faculty, for some reason or other my family found it
      necessary to make a thorough change in our menu and the dinner
      arrangements. Instead of the simple food I was used to as a student and a
      doctor, I am now fed on potage-puree, with some sossoulki swimming
      about in it, and kidneys in Madeira. The title of General and my renown
      have robbed me for ever of schi and savoury pies, and roast goose
      with apple sauce, and bream with kasha. They robbed me as well of
      my maid servant Agasha, a funny, talkative old woman, instead of whom I am
      now waited on by Yegor, a stupid, conceited fellow who always has a white
      glove in his right hand. The intervals between the courses are short, but
      they seem terribly long. There is nothing to fill them. We don't have any
      more of the old good-humour, the familiar conversations, the jokes and the
      laughter; no more mutual endearments, or the gaiety that used to animate
      my children, my wife, and myself when we met at the dinner table. For a
      busy man like me dinner was a time to rest and meet my friends, and a
      feast for my wife and children, not a very long feast, to be sure, but a
      gay and happy one, for they knew that for half an hour I did not belong to
      science and my students, but solely to them and to no one else. No more
      chance of getting tipsy on a single glass of wine, no more Agasha, no more
      bream with kasha, no more the old uproar to welcome our little contretemps
      at dinner, when the cat fought the dog under the table, or Katy's
      head-band fell down her cheek into her soup.
    

      Our dinner nowadays is as nasty to describe as to eat. On my wife's face
      there is pompousness, an assumed gravity, and the usual anxiety. She eyes
      our plates nervously: "I see you don't like the meat?... Honestly, don't
      you like it?" And I must answer, "Don't worry, my dear. The meat is very
      good." She: "You're always taking my part, Nicolai Stiepanich. You never
      tell the truth. Why has Alexander Adolphovich eaten so little?" and the
      same sort of conversation for the whole of dinner. Liza laughs staccato
      and screws up her eyes. I look at both of them, and at this moment at
      dinner here I can see quite clearly that their inner lives have slipped
      out of my observation long ago. I feel as though once upon a time I lived
      at home with a real family, but now I am dining as a guest with an unreal
      wife and looking at an unreal Liza. There has been an utter change in both
      of them, while I have lost sight of the long process that led up to the
      change. No wonder I don't understand anything. What was the reason of the
      change? I don't know. Perhaps the only trouble is that God did not give my
      wife and daughter the strength He gave me. From my childhood I have been
      accustomed to resist outside influences and have been hardened enough.
      Such earthly catastrophes as fame, being made General, the change from
      comfort to living above my means, acquaintance with high society, have
      scarcely touched me. I have survived safe and sound. But it all fell down
      like an avalanche on my weak, unhardened wife and Liza, and crushed them.
    

      Gnekker and the girls talk of fugues and counter-fugues; singers and
      pianists, Bach and Brahms, and my wife, frightened of being suspected of
      musical ignorance, smiles sympathetically and murmurs: "Wonderful.... Is
      it possible?... Why?..." Gnekker eats steadily, jokes gravely, and listens
      condescendingly to the ladies' remarks. Now and then he has the desire to
      talk bad French, and then he finds it necessary for some unknown reason to
      address me magnificently, "Votre Excellence."
    

      And I am morose. Apparently I embarrass them all and they embarrass me. I
      never had any intimate acquaintance with class antagonism before, but now
      something of the kind torments me indeed. I try to find only bad traits in
      Gnekker. It does not take long and then I am tormented because one of my
      friends has not taken his place as bridegroom. In another way too his
      presence has a bad effect upon me. Usually, when I am left alone with
      myself or when I am in the company of people I love, I never think of my
      merits; and if I begin to think about them they seem as trivial as though
      I had become a scholar only yesterday. But in the presence of a man like
      Gnekker my merits appear to me like an extremely high mountain, whose
      summit is lost in the clouds, while Gnekkers move about the foot, so small
      as hardly to be seen.
    

      After dinner I go up to my study and light my little pipe, the only one
      during the whole day, the sole survivor of my old habit of smoking from
      morning to night. My wife comes into me while I am smoking and sits down
      to speak to me. Just as in the morning, I know beforehand what the
      conversation will be.
    

      "We ought to talk seriously, Nicolai Stiepanovich," she begins. "I mean
      about Liza. Why won't you attend?"
    

      "Attend to what?"
    

      "You pretend you don't notice anything. It's not right: It's not right to
      be unconcerned. Gnekker has intentions about Liza. What do you say to
      that?"
    

      "I can't say he's a bad man, because I don't know him; but I've told you a
      thousand times already that I don't like him."
    

      "But that's impossible ... impossible...." She rises and walks about in
      agitation.
    

      "It's impossible to have such an attitude to a serious matter," she says.
      "When our daughter's happiness is concerned, we must put everything
      personal aside. I know you don't like him.... Very well.... But if we
      refuse him now and upset everything, how can you guarantee that Liza won't
      have a grievance against us for the rest of her life? Heaven knows there
      aren't many young men nowadays. It's quite likely there won't be another
      chance. He loves Liza very much and she likes him, evidently. Of course he
      hasn't a settled position. But what is there to do? Please God, he'll get
      a position in time. He comes of a good family, and he's rich."
    

      "How did you find that out?"
    

      "He said so himself. His father has a big house in Kharkov and an estate
      outside. You must certainly go to Kharkov."
    

      "Why?"
    

      "You'll find out there. You have acquaintances among the professors there.
      I'd go myself. But I'm a woman. I can't."
    

      "I will not go to Kharkov," I say morosely.
    

      My wife gets frightened; a tormented expression comes over her face.
    

      "For God's sake, Nicolai Stiepanich," she implores, sobbing, "For God's
      sake help me with this burden! It hurts me."
    

      It is painful to look at her.
    

      "Very well, Varya," I say kindly, "If you like—very well I'll go to
      Kharkov, and do everything you want."
    

      She puts her handkerchief to her eyes and goes to cry in her room. I am
      left alone.
    

      A little later they bring in the lamp. The familiar shadows that have
      wearied me for years fall from the chairs and the lamp-shade on to the
      walls and the floor. When I look at them it seems that it's night already,
      and the cursed insomnia has begun. I lie down on the bed; then I get up
      and walk about the room then lie down again. My nervous excitement
      generally reaches its highest after dinner, before the evening. For no
      reason I begin to cry and hide my head in the pillow. All the while I am
      afraid somebody may come in; I am afraid I shall die suddenly; I am
      ashamed of my tears; altogether, something intolerable is happening in my
      soul. I feel I cannot look at the lamp or the books or the shadows on the
      floor, or listen to the voices in the drawing-room any more. Some
      invisible, mysterious force pushes me rudely out of my house. I jump up,
      dress hurriedly, and go cautiously out into the street so that the
      household shall not notice me. Where shall I go?
    

      The answer to this question has long been there in my brain: "To Katy."
    


      III
    

      As usual she is lying on the Turkish divan or the couch and reading
      something. Seeing me she lifts her head languidly, sits down, and gives me
      her hand.
    

      "You are always lying down like that," I say after a reposeful silence.
      "It's unhealthy. You'd far better be doing something."
    

      "Ah?"
    

      "You'd far better be doing something, I say."
    

      "What?... A woman can be either a simple worker or an actress."
    

      "Well, then—if you can't become a worker, be an actress."
    

      She is silent.
    

      "You had better marry," I say, half-joking.
    

      "There's no one to marry: and no use if I did."
    

      "You can't go on living like this."
    

      "Without a husband? As if that mattered. There are as many men as you
      like, if you only had the will."
    

      "This isn't right, Katy."
    

      "What isn't right?"
    

      "What you said just now."
    

      Katy sees that I am chagrined, and desires to soften the bad impression.
    

      "Come. Let's come here. Here."
    

      She leads me into a small room, very cosy, and points to the writing
      table.
    

      "There. I made it for you. You'll work here. Come every day and bring your
      work with you. They only disturb you there at home.... Will you work here?
      Would you like to?"
    

      In order not to hurt her by refusing, I answer that I shall work with her
      and that I like the room immensely. Then we both sit down in the cosy room
      and begin to talk.
    

      The warmth, the cosy surroundings, the presence of a sympathetic being,
      rouses in me now not a feeling of pleasure as it used but a strong desire
      to complain and grumble. Anyhow it seems to me that if I moan and complain
      I shall feel better.
    

      "It's a bad business, my dear," I begin with a sigh. "Very bad."
    

      "What is the matter?"
    

      "I'll tell you what is the matter. The best and most sacred right of kings
      is the right to pardon. And I have always felt myself a king so long as I
      used this right prodigally. I never judged, I was compassionate, I
      pardoned everyone right and left. Where others protested and revolted I
      only advised and persuaded. All my life I've tried to make my society
      tolerable to the family of students, friends and servants. And this
      attitude of mine towards people, I know, educated every one who came into
      contact with me. But now I am king no more. There's something going on in
      me which belongs only to slaves. Day and night evil thoughts roam about in
      my head, and feelings which I never knew before have made their home in my
      soul. I hate and despise; I'm exasperated, disturbed, and afraid. I've
      become strict beyond measure, exacting, unkind, and suspicious. Even the
      things which in the past gave me the chance of making an extra pun, now
      bring me a feeling of oppression. My logic has changed too. I used to
      despise money alone; now I cherish evil feelings, not to money, but to the
      rich, as if they were guilty. I used to hate violence and arbitrariness;
      now I hate the people who employ violence, as if they alone are to blame
      and not all of us, who cannot educate one another. What does it all mean?
      If my new thoughts and feelings come from a change of my convictions,
      where could the change have come from? Has the world grown worse and I
      better, or was I blind and indifferent before? But if the change is due to
      the general decline of my physical and mental powers—I am sick and
      losing weight every day—then I'm in a pitiable position. It means
      that my new thoughts are abnormal and unhealthy, that I must be ashamed of
      them and consider them valueless...."
    

      "Sickness hasn't anything to do with it," Katy interrupts. "Your eyes are
      opened—that's all. You've begun to notice things you didn't want to
      notice before for some reason. My opinion is that you must break with your
      family finally first of all and then go away."
    

      "You're talking nonsense."
    

      "You don't love them any more. Then, why do you behave unfairly? And is it
      a family! Mere nobodies. If they died to-day, no one would notice their
      absence to-morrow."
    

      Katy despises my wife and daughter as much as they hate her. It's scarcely
      possible nowadays to speak of the right of people to despise one another.
      But if you accept Katy's point of view and own that such a right exists,
      you will notice that she has the same right to despise my wife and Liza as
      they have to hate her.
    

      "Mere nobodies!" she repeats. "Did you have any dinner to-day? It's a
      wonder they didn't forget to tell you dinner was ready. I don't know how
      they still remember that you exist."
    

      "Katy!" I say sternly. "Please be quiet."
    

      "You don't think it's fun for me to talk about them, do you? I wish I
      didn't know them at all. You listen to me, dear. Leave everything and go
      away: go abroad—the quicker, the better."
    

      "What nonsense! What about the University?"
    

      "And the University, too. What is it to you? There's no sense in it all.
      You've been lecturing for thirty years, and where are your pupils? Have
      you many famous scholars? Count them up. But to increase the number of
      doctors who exploit the general ignorance and make hundreds of thousands,—there's
      no need to be a good and gifted man. You aren't wanted."
    

      "My God, how bitter you are!" I get terrified. "How bitter you are. Be
      quiet, or I'll go away. I can't reply to the bitter things you say."
    

      The maid enters and calls us to tea. Thank God, our conversation changes
      round the samovar. I have made my moan, and now I want to indulge another
      senile weakness—reminiscences. I tell Katy about my past, to my
      great surprise with details that I never suspected I had kept safe in my
      memory. And she listens to me with emotion, with pride, holding her
      breath. I like particularly to tell how I once was a student at a seminary
      and how I dreamed of entering the University.
    

      "I used to walk in the seminary garden," I tell her, "and the wind would
      bring the sound of a song and the thrumming of an accordion from a distant
      tavern, or a troika with bells would pass quickly by the seminary
      fence. That would be quite enough to fill not only my breast with a sense
      of happiness, but my stomach, legs, and hands. As I heard the sound of the
      accordion or the bells fading away, I would see myself a doctor and paint
      pictures, one more glorious than another. And, you see, my dreams came
      true. There were more things I dared to dream of. I have been a favourite
      professor thirty years, I have had excellent friends and an honourable
      reputation. I loved and married when I was passionately in love. I had
      children. Altogether, when I look back the whole of my life seems like a
      nice, clever composition. The only thing I have to do now is not to spoil
      the finale. For this, I must die like a man. If death is really a
      danger then I must meet it as becomes a teacher, a scholar, and a citizen
      of a Christian State. But I am spoiling the finale. I am drowning,
      and I run to you and beg for help, and you say: 'Drown. It's your duty.'"
    

      At this point a ring at the bell sounds in the hall. Katy and I both
      recognise it and say:
    

      "That must be Mikhail Fiodorovich."
    

      And indeed in a minute Mikhail Fiodorovich, my colleague, the philologist,
      enters. He is a tall, well-built man about fifty years old, clean shaven,
      with thick grey hair and black eyebrows. He is a good man and an admirable
      friend. He belongs to an old aristocratic family, a prosperous and gifted
      house which has played a notable rÃ´le in the history of our
      literature and education. He himself is clever, gifted, and highly
      educated, but not without his eccentricities. To a certain extent we are
      all eccentric, queer fellows, but his eccentricities have an element of
      the exceptional, not quite safe for his friends. Among the latter I know
      not a few who cannot see his many merits clearly because of his
      eccentricities.
    

      As he walks in he slowly removes his gloves and says in his velvety bass:
    

      "How do you do? Drinking tea. Just in time. It's hellishly cold."
    

      Then he sits down at the table, takes a glass of tea and immediately
      begins to talk. What chiefly marks his way of talking is his invariably
      ironical tone, a mixture of philosophy and jest, like Shakespeare's
      grave-diggers. He always talks of serious matters; but never seriously.
      His opinions are always acid and provocative, but thanks to his tender,
      easy, jesting tone, it somehow happens that his acidity and
      provocativeness don't tire one's ears, and one very soon gets used to it.
      Every evening he brings along some half-dozen stories of the university
      life and generally begins with them when he sits down at the table.
    

      "O Lord," he sighs with an amusing movement of his black eyebrows, "there
      are some funny people in the world."
    

      "Who?" asks Katy.
    

      "I was coming down after my lecture to-day and I met that old idiot N——
      on the stairs. He walks along, as usual pushing out that horse jowl of
      his, looking for some one to bewail his headaches, his wife, and his
      students, who won't come to his lectures. 'Well,' I think to myself, 'he's
      seen me. It's all up—no hope for And so on in the same strain. Or he
      begins like this,
    

      "Yesterday I was at Z's public lecture. Tell it not in Gath, but I do
      wonder how our alma mater dares to show the public such an ass,
      such a double-dyed blockhead as Z. Why he's a European fool. Good Lord,
      you won't find one like him in all Europe—not even if you looked in
      daytime, and with a lantern. Imagine it: he lectures as though he were
      sucking a stick of barley-sugar—su—su—su. He gets a
      fright because he can't make out his manuscript. His little thoughts will
      only just keep moving, hardly moving, like a bishop riding a bicycle.
      Above all you can't make out a word he says. The flies die of boredom,
      it's so terrific. It can only be compared with the boredom in the great
      Hall at the Commemoration, when the traditional speech is made. To hell
      with it!"
    

      Immediately an abrupt change of subject.
    

      "I had to make the speech; three years ago. Nicolai Stiepanovich will
      remember. It was hot, close. My full uniform was tight under my arms,
      tight as death. I read for half an hour, an hour, an hour and a half, two
      hours. 'Well,' I thought, 'thank God I've only ten pages left.' And I had
      four pages of peroration that I needn't read at all. 'Only six pages
      then,' I thought. Imagine it. I just gave a glance in front of me and saw
      sitting next to each other in the front row a general with a broad ribbon
      and a bishop. The poor devils were bored stiff. They were staring about
      madly to stop themselves from going to sleep. For all that they are still
      trying to look attentive, to make some appearance of understanding what
      I'm reading, and look as though they like it. 'Well,' I thought, 'if you
      like it, then you shall have it. I'll spite you.' So I set to and read the
      four pages, every word."
    

      When he speaks only his eyes and eyebrows smile as it is generally with
      the ironical. At such moments there is no hatred or malice in his eyes but
      a great deal of acuteness and that peculiar fox-cunning which you can
      catch only in very observant people. Further, about his eyes I have
      noticed one more peculiarity. When he takes his glass from Katy, or
      listens to her remarks, or follows her with a glance as she goes out of
      the room for a little while, then I catch in his look something humble,
      prayerful, pure....
    

      The maid takes the samovar away and puts on the table a big piece of
      cheese, some fruit, and a bottle of Crimean champagne, a thoroughly bad
      wine which Katy got to like when she lived in the Crimea. Mikhail
      Fiodorovich takes two packs of cards from the shelves and sets them out
      for patience. If one may believe his assurances, some games of patience
      demand a great power of combination and concentration. Nevertheless while
      he sets out the cards he amuses himself by talking continually. Katy
      follows his cards carefully, helping him more by mimicry than words. In
      the whole evening she drinks no more than two small glasses of wine, I
      drink only a quarter of a glass, the remainder of the bottle falls to
      Mikhail Fiodorovich, who can drink any amount without ever getting drunk.
    

      During patience we solve all kinds of questions, mostly of the lofty
      order, and our dearest love, science, comes off second best.
    

      "Science, thank God, has had her day," says Mikhail Fiodorovich very
      slowly. "She has had her swan-song. Ye-es. Mankind has begun to feel the
      desire to replace her by something else. She was grown from the soil of
      prejudice, fed by prejudices, and is now the same quintessence of
      prejudices as were her bygone grandmothers: alchemy, metaphysics and
      philosophy. As between European scholars and the Chinese who have no
      sciences at all the difference is merely trifling, a matter only of
      externals. The Chinese had no scientific knowledge, but what have they
      lost by that?"
    

      "Flies haven't any scientific knowledge either," I say; "but what does
      that prove?"
    

      "It's no use getting angry, Nicolai Stiepanich. I say this only between
      ourselves. I'm more cautious than you think. I shan't proclaim it from the
      housetops, God forbid! The masses still keep alive a prejudice that
      science and art are superior to agriculture and commerce, superior to
      crafts. Our persuasion makes a living from this prejudice. It's not for
      you and me to destroy it. God forbid!"
    

      During patience the younger generation also comes in for it.
    

      "Our public is degenerate nowadays," Mikhail Fiodorovich sighs. "I don't
      speak of ideals and such things, I only ask that they should be able to
      work and think decently. 'Sadly I look at the men of our time'—it's
      quite true in this connection."
    

      "Yes, they're frightfully degenerate," Katy agrees. "Tell me, had you one
      single eminent person under you during the last five or ten years?"
    

      "I don't know how it is with the other professors,—but somehow I
      don't recollect that it ever happened to me."
    

      "In my lifetime I've seen a great many of your students and young
      scholars, a great many actors.... What happened? I never once had the luck
      to meet, not a hero or a man of talent, but an ordinarily interesting
      person. Everything's dull and incapable, swollen and pretentious...."
    

      All these conversations about degeneracy give me always the impression
      that I have unwittingly overheard an unpleasant conversation about my
      daughter. I feel offended because the indictments are made wholesale and
      are based upon such ancient hackneyed commonplaces and such penny-dreadful
      notions as degeneracy, lack of ideals, or comparisons with the glorious
      past. Any indictment, even if it's made in a company of ladies, should be
      formulated with all possible precision; otherwise it isn't an indictment,
      but an empty calumny, unworthy of decent people.
    

      I am an old man, and have served for the last thirty years; but I don't
      see any sign either of degeneracy or the lack of ideals. I don't find it
      any worse now than before. My porter, Nicolas, whose experience in this
      case has its value, says that students nowadays are neither better nor
      worse than their predecessors.
    

      If I were asked what was the thing I did not like about my present pupils,
      I wouldn't say offhand or answer at length, but with a certain precision.
      I know their defects and there's no need for me to take refuge in a mist
      of commonplaces. I don't like the way they smoke, and drink spirits, and
      marry late; or the way they are careless and indifferent to the point of
      allowing students to go hungry in their midst, and not paying their debts
      into "The Students' Aid Society." They are ignorant of modern languages
      and express themselves incorrectly in Russian. Only yesterday my
      colleague, the hygienist, complained to me that he had to lecture twice as
      often because of their incompetent knowledge of physics and their complete
      ignorance of meteorology. They are readily influenced by the most modern
      writers, and some of those not the best, but they are absolutely
      indifferent to classics like Shakespeare, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and
      Pascal; and their worldly unpracticality shows itself mostly in their
      inability to distinguish between great and small. They solve all difficult
      questions which have a more or less social character (emigration, for
      instance) by getting up subscriptions, but not by the method of scientific
      investigation and experiment, though this is at their full disposal, and,
      above all, corresponds to their vocation. They readily become
      house-doctors, assistant house-doctors, clinical assistants, or consulting
      doctors, and they are prepared to keep these positions until they are
      forty, though independence, a sense of freedom, and personal initiative
      are quite as necessary in science, as, for instance, in art or commerce. I
      have pupils and listeners, but I have no helpers or successors. Therefore
      I love them and am concerned for them, but I'm not proud of them ... and
      so on.
    

      However great the number of such defects may be, it's only in a cowardly
      and timid person that they give rise to pessimism and distraction. All of
      them are by nature accidental and transitory, and are completely dependent
      on the conditions of life. Ten years will be enough for them to disappear
      or give place to new and different defects, which are quite indispensable,
      but will in their turn give the timid a fright. Students' shortcomings
      often annoy me, but the annoyance is nothing in comparison with the joy I
      have had these thirty years in speaking with my pupils, lecturing to them,
      studying their relations and comparing them with people of a different
      class.
    

      Mikhail Fiodorovich is a slanderer. Katy listens and neither of them
      notices how deep is the pit into which they are drawn by such an outwardly
      innocuous recreation as condemning one's neighbours. They don't realise
      how a simple conversation gradually turns into mockery and derision, or
      how they both begin even to employ the manners of calumny.
    

      "There are some queer types to be found," says Mikhail Fiodorovich.
      "Yesterday I went to see our friend Yegor Pietrovich. There I found a
      student, one of your medicos, a third-year man, I think. His face ...
      rather in the style of Dobroliubov—the stamp of profound thought on
      his brow. We began to talk. 'My dear fellow—an extraordinary
      business. I've just read that some German or other—can't remember
      his name—has extracted a new alkaloid from the human brain—idiotine.'
      Do you know he really believed it, and produced an expression of respect
      on his face, as much as to say, 'See, what a power we are.'"
    

      "The other day I went to the theatre. I sat down. Just in front of me in
      the next row two people were sitting: one, 'one of the chosen,' evidently
      a law student, the other a whiskery medico. The medico was as drunk as a
      cobbler. Not an atom of attention to the stage. Dozing and nodding. But
      the moment some actor began to deliver a loud monologue, or just raised
      his voice, my medico thrills, digs his neighbour in the ribs. 'What's he
      say? Something noble?' 'Noble,' answers 'the chosen.'
    

      "'Brrravo!' bawls the medico. 'No—ble. Bravo.' You see the drunken
      blockhead didn't come to the theatre for art, but for something noble. He
      wants nobility."
    

      Katy listens and laughs. Her laugh is rather strange. She breathes out in
      swift, rhythmic, and regular alternation with her inward breathing. It's
      as though she were playing an accordion. Of her face, only her nostrils
      laugh. My heart fails me. I don't know what to say. I lose my temper,
      crimson, jump up from my seat and cry:
    

      "Be quiet, won't you? Why do you sit here like two toads, poisoning the
      air with your breath? I've had enough."
    

      In vain I wait for them to stop their slanders. I prepare to go home. And
      it's time, too. Past ten o'clock.
    

      "I'll sit here a little longer," says Mikhail Fiodorovich, "if you give me
      leave, Ekaterina Vladimirovna?"
    

      "You have my leave," Katy answers.
    

      "Bene. In that case, order another bottle, please."
    

      Together they escort me to the hall with candles in their hands. While I'm
      putting on my overcoat, Mikhail Fiodorovich says:
    

      "You've grown terribly thin and old lately. Nicolai Stiepanovich. What's
      the matter with you? Ill?
    

      "Yes, a little."
    

      "And he will not look after himself," Katy puts in sternly.
    

      "Why don't you look after yourself? How can you go on like this? God helps
      those who help themselves, my dear man. Give my regards to your family and
      make my excuses for not coming. One of these days, before I go abroad,
      I'll come to say good-bye. Without fail. I'm off next week."
    

      I came away from Katy's irritated, frightened by the talk about my illness
      and discontented with myself. "And why," I ask myself, "shouldn't I be
      attended by one of my colleagues?" Instantly I see how my friend, after
      sounding me, will go to the window silently, think a little while, turn
      towards me and say, indifferently, trying to prevent me from reading the
      truth in his face: "At the moment I don't see anything particular; but
      still, cher confrÃ¨re, I would advise you to break off your work...." And
      that will take my last hope away.
    

      Who doesn't have hopes? Nowadays, when I diagnose and treat myself, I
      sometimes hope that my ignorance deceives me, that I am mistaken about the
      albumen and sugar which I find, as well as about my heart, and also about
      the anasarca which I have noticed twice in the morning. While I read over
      the therapeutic text-books again with the eagerness of a hypochondriac,
      and change the prescriptions every day, I still believe that I will come
      across something hopeful. How trivial it all is!
    

      Whether the sky is cloudy all over or the moon and stars are shining in
      it, every time I come back home I look at it and think that death will
      take me soon. Surely at that moment my thoughts should be as deep as the
      sky, as bright, as striking ... but no! I think of myself, of my wife,
      Liza, Gnekker, the students, people in general. My thoughts are not good,
      they are mean; I juggle with myself, and at this moment my attitude
      towards life can be expressed in the words the famous Arakheev wrote in
      one of his intimate letters: "All good in the world is inseparably linked
      to bad, and there is always more bad than good." Which means that
      everything is ugly, there's nothing to live for, and the sixty-two years I
      have lived out must be counted as lost. I surprise myself in these
      thoughts and try to convince myself they are accidental and temporary and
      not deeply rooted in me, but I think immediately:
    

      "If that's true, why am I drawn every evening to those two toads." And I
      swear to myself never to go to Katy any more, though I know I will go to
      her again to-morrow.
    

      As I pull my door bell and go upstairs, I feel already that I have no
      family and no desire to return to it. It is plain my new, Arakheev
      thoughts are not accidental or temporary in me, but possess my whole
      being. With a bad conscience, dull, indolent, hardly able to move my
      limbs, as though I had a ten ton weight upon me, I lie down in my bed and
      soon fall asleep.
    

      And then—insomnia.
    


      IV
    

      The summer comes and life changes.
    

      One fine morning Liza comes in to me and says in a joking tone:
    

      "Come, Your Excellency. It's all ready."
    

      They lead My Excellency into the street, put me into a cab and drive me
      away. For want of occupation I read the signboards backwards as I go. The
      word "Tavern" becomes "Nrevat." That would do for a baron's name: Baroness
      Nrevat. Beyond, I drive across the field by the cemetery, which produces
      no impression upon me whatever, though I'll soon lie there. After a two
      hours' drive, My Excellency is led into the ground-floor of the bungalow,
      and put into a small, lively room with a light-blue paper.
    

      Insomnia at night as before, but I am no more wakeful in the morning and
      don't listen to my wife, but lie in bed. I don't sleep, but I am in a
      sleepy state, half-forgetfulness, when you know you are not asleep, but
      have dreams. I get up in the afternoon, and sit down at the table by force
      of habit, but now I don't work any more but amuse myself with French
      yellow-backs sent me by Katy. Of course it would be more patriotic to read
      Russian authors, but to tell the truth I'm not particularly disposed to
      them. Leaving out two or three old ones, all the modern literature doesn't
      seem to me to be literature but a unique home industry which exists only
      to be encouraged, but the goods are bought with reluctance. The best of
      these homemade goods can't be called remarkable and it's impossible to
      praise it sincerely without a saving "but"; and the same must be said of
      all the literary novelties I've read during the last ten or fifteen years.
      Not one remarkable, and you can't dispense with "but." They have
      cleverness, nobility, and no talent; talent, nobility and no cleverness;
      or finally, talent, cleverness, but no nobility.
    

      I would not say that French books have talent, cleverness, and nobility.
      Nor do they satisfy me. But they are not so boring as the Russian; and it
      is not rare to find in them the chief constituent of creative genius—the
      sense of personal freedom, which is lacking to Russian authors. I do not
      recall one single new book in which from the very first page the author
      did not try to tie himself up in all manner of conventions and contracts
      with his conscience. One is frightened to speak of the naked body, another
      is bound hand and foot by psychological analysis, a third must have "a
      kindly attitude to his fellow-men," the fourth heaps up whole pages with
      descriptions of nature on purpose to avoid any suspicion of a tendency....
      One desires to be in his books a bourgeois at all costs, another at all
      costs an aristocrat. Deliberation, cautiousness, cunning: but no freedom,
      no courage to write as one likes, and therefore no creative genius.
    

      All this refers to belles-lettres, so-called.
    

      As for serious articles in Russian, on sociology, for instance, or art and
      so forth, I don't read them, simply out of timidity. For some reason in my
      childhood and youth I had a fear of porters and theatre attendants, and
      this fear has remained with me up till now. Even now I am afraid of them.
      It is said that only that which one cannot understand seems terrible. And
      indeed it is very difficult to understand why hall-porters and theatre
      attendants are so pompous and haughty and importantly polite. When I read
      serious articles, I have exactly the same indefinable fear. Their
      portentous gravity, their playfulness, like an archbishop's, their
      over-familiar attitude to foreign authors, their capacity for talking
      dignified nonsense—"filling a vacuum with emptiness"—it is all
      inconceivable to me and terrifying, and quite unlike the modesty and the
      calm and gentlemanly tone to which I am accustomed when reading our
      writers on medicine and the natural sciences. Not only articles; I have
      difficulty also in reading translations even when they are edited by
      serious Russians. The presumptuous benevolence of the prefaces, the
      abundance of notes by the translator (which prevents one from
      concentrating), the parenthetical queries and sics, which are so
      liberally scattered over the book or the article by the translator—seem
      to me an assault on the author's person, as well as on my independence as
      a reader.
    

      Once I was invited as an expert to the High Court. In the interval one of
      my fellow-experts called my attention to the rude behaviour of the public
      prosecutor to the prisoners, among whom were two women intellectuals. I
      don't think I exaggerated at all when I replied to my colleague that he
      was not behaving more rudely than authors of serious articles behave to
      one another. Indeed their behaviour is so rude that one speaks of them
      with bitterness. They behave to each other or to the writers whom they
      criticise either with too much deference, careless of their own dignity,
      or, on the other hand, they treat them much worse than I have treated
      Gnekker, my future son-in-law, in these notes and thoughts of mine.
      Accusations of irresponsibility, of impure intentions, of any kind of
      crime even, are the usual adornment of serious articles. And this, as our
      young medicos love to say in their little articles—quite ultima
      ratio. Such an attitude must necessarily be reflected in the character
      of the young generation of writers, and therefore I'm not at all surprised
      that in the new books which, have been added to our belles lettres
      in the last ten or fifteen years, the heroes drink a great deal of vodka
      and the heroines are not sufficiently chaste.
    

      I read French books and look out of the window, which is open—I see
      the pointed palings of my little garden, two or three skinny trees, and
      there, beyond the garden, the road, fields, then a wide strip of young
      pine-forest. I often delight in watching a little boy and girl, both
      white-haired and ragged, climb on the garden fence and laugh at my
      baldness. In their shining little eyes I read, "Come out, thou bald-head."
      These are almost the only people who don't care a bit about my reputation
      or my title.
    

      I don't have visitors everyday now. I'll mention only the visits of
      Nicolas and Piotr Ignatievich. Nicolas comes to me usually on holidays,
      pretending to come on business, but really to see me. He is very
      hilarious, a thing which never happens to him in the winter.
    

      "Well, what have you got to say?" I ask him, coming out into the passage.
    

      "Your Excellency!" he says, pressing his hand to his heart and looking at
      me with a lover's rapture. "Your Excellency! So help me God! God strike me
      where I stand! Gaudeamus igitur juvenestus."
    

      And he kisses me eagerly on the shoulders, on my sleeves, and buttons.
    

      "Is everything all right over there?" I ask.
    

      "Your Excellency! I swear to God...."
    

      He never stops swearing, quite unnecessarily, and I soon get bored, and
      send him to the kitchen, where they give him dinner. Piotr Ignatievich
      also comes on holidays specially to visit me and communicate his thoughts
      to me. He usually sits by the table in my room, modest, clean, judicious,
      without daring to cross his legs or lean his elbows on the table, all the
      while telling me in a quiet, even voice what he considers very piquant
      items of news gathered from journals and pamphlets.
    

      These items are all alike and can be reduced to the following type: A
      Frenchman made a discovery. Another—a German—exposed him by
      showing that this discovery had been made as long ago as 1870 by some
      American. Then a third—also a German—outwitted them both by
      showing that both of them had been confused, by taking spherules of air
      under a microscope for dark pigment. Even when he wants to make me laugh,
      Piotr Ignatievich tells his story at great length, very much as though he
      were defending a thesis, enumerating his literary sources in detail, with
      every effort to avoid mistakes in the dates, the particular number of the
      journal and the names. Moreover, he does not say Petit simply but
      inevitably, Jean Jacques Petit. If he happens to stay to dinner, he will
      tell the same sort of piquant stories and drive all the company to
      despondency. If Gnekker and Liza begin to speak of fugues and
      counter-fugues in his presence he modestly lowers his eyes, and his face
      falls. He is ashamed that such trivialities should be spoken of in the
      presence of such serious men as him and me.
    

      In my present state of mind five minutes are enough for him to bore me as
      though I had seen and listened to him for a whole eternity. I hate the
      poor man. I wither away beneath his quiet, even voice and his bookish
      language. His stories make me stupid.... He cherishes the kindliest
      feelings towards me and talks to me only to give me pleasure. I reward him
      by staring at his face as if I wanted to hypnotise him, and thinking "Go
      away. Go, go...." But he is proof against my mental suggestion and sits,
      sits, sits....
    

      While he sits with me I cannot rid myself of the idea: "When I die, it's
      quite possible that he will be appointed in my place." Then my poor
      audience appears to me as an oasis where the stream has dried, up, and I
      am unkind to Piotr Ignatievich, and silent and morose as if he were guilty
      of such thoughts and not I myself. When he begins, as usual, to glorify
      the German scholars, I no longer jest good-naturedly, but murmur sternly:
    

      "They're fools, your Germans...."
    

      It's like the late Professor Nikita Krylov when he was bathing with
      Pirogov at Reval. He got angry with the water, which was very cold, and
      swore about "These scoundrelly Germans." I behave badly to Piotr
      Ignatievich; and it's only when he is going away and I see through the
      window his grey hat disappearing behind the garden fence, that I want to
      call him back and say: "Forgive me, my dear fellow."
    

      The dinner goes yet more wearily than in winter. The same Gnekker, whom I
      now hate and despise, dines with me every day. Before, I used to suffer
      his presence in silence, but now I say biting things to him, which make my
      wife and Liza blush. Carried away by an evil feeling, I often say things
      that are merely foolish, end don't know why I say them. Thus it happened
      once that after looking at Gnekker contemptuously for a long while, I
      suddenly fired off, for no reason at all:
    

      "Eagles than barnyard-fowls may lower bend; But fowls shall never to
      the heav'ns ascend."


      More's the pity that the fowl Gnekker shows himself more clever than the
      eagle professor. Knowing my wife and daughter are on his side he maintains
      these tactics. He replies to my shafts with a condescending silence ("The
      old man's off his head.... What's the good of talking to him?"), or makes
      good-humoured fun of me. It is amazing to what depths of pettiness a man
      may descend. During the whole dinner I can dream how Gnekker will be shown
      to be an adventurer, how Liza and my wife will realise their mistake, and
      I will tease them—ridiculous dreams like these at a time when I have
      one foot in the grave.
    

      Now there occur misunderstandings, of a kind which I formerly knew only by
      hearsay. Though it is painful I will describe one which occurred after
      dinner the other day. I sit in my room smoking a little pipe. Enters my
      wife, as usual, sits down and begins to talk. What a good idea it would be
      to go to Kharkov now while the weather is warm and there is the time, and
      inquire what kind of man our Gnekker is.
    

      "Very well. I'll go," I agree.
    

      My wife gets up, pleased with me, and walks to the door; but immediately
      returns:
    

      "By-the bye, I've one more favour to ask. I know you'll be angry; but it's
      my duty to warn you.... Forgive me, Nicolai,—but all our neighbours
      have begun to talk about the way you go to Katy's continually. I don't
      deny that she's clever and educated. It's pleasant to spend the time with
      her. But at your age and in your position it's rather strange to find
      pleasure in her society.... Besides she has a reputation enough to...."
    

      All my blood rushes instantly from my brain. My eyes flash fire. I catch
      hold of my hair, and stamp and cry, in a voice that is not mine:
    

      "Leave me alone, leave me, leave me...."
    

      My face is probably terrible, and my voice strange, for my wife suddenly
      gets pale, and calls aloud, with a despairing voice, also not her own. At
      our cries rush in Liza and Gnekker, then Yegor.
    

      My feet grow numb, as though they did not exist. I feel that I am falling
      into somebody's arms. Then I hear crying for a little while and sink into
      a faint which lasts for two or three hours.
    

      Now for Katy. She comes to see me before evening every day, which of
      course must be noticed by my neighbours and my friends. After a minute she
      takes me with her for a drive. She has her own horse and a new buggy she
      bought this summer. Generally she lives like a princess. She has taken an
      expensive detached bungalow with a big garden, and put into it all her
      town furniture. She has two maids and a coachman. I often ask her:
    

      "Katy, what will you live on when you've spent all your father's money?"
    

      "We'll see, then," she answers.
    

      "But this money deserves to be treated more seriously, my dear. It was
      earned by a good man and honest labour."
    

      "You've told me that before. I know."
    

      First we drive by the field, then by a young pine forest, which you can
      see from my window. Nature seems to me as beautiful as she used, although
      the devil whispers to me that all these pines and firs, the birds and
      white clouds in the sky will not notice my absence in three or four months
      when I am dead. Katy likes to take the reins, and it is good that the
      weather is fine and I am sitting by her side. She is in a happy mood, and
      does not say bitter things.
    

      "You're a very good man, Nicolai," she says. "You are a rare bird. There's
      no actor who could play your part. Mine or Mikhail's, for instance—even
      a bad actor could manage, but yours—there's nobody. I envy you, envy
      you terribly I What am I? What?"
    

      She thinks for a moment, and asks:
    

      "I'm a negative phenomenon, aren't I?"
    

      "Yes," I answer.
    

      "H'm ... what's to be done then?"
    

      What answer can I give? It's easy to say "Work," or "Give your property to
      the poor," or "Know yourself," and because it's so easy to say this I
      don't know what to answer.
    

      My therapeutist colleagues, when teaching methods of cure, advise one "to
      individualise each particular case." This advice must be followed in order
      to convince one's self that the remedies recommended in the text-books as
      the best and most thoroughly suitable as a general rule, are quite
      unsuitable in particular cases. It applies to moral affections as well.
      But I must answer something. So I say:
    

      "You've too much time on your hands, my dear. You must take up
      something.... In fact, why shouldn't you go on the stage again, if you
      have a vocation."
    

      "I can't."
    

      "You have the manner and tone of a victim. I don't like it, my dear. You
      have yourself to blame. Remember, you began by getting angry with people
      and things in general; but you never did anything to improve either of
      them. You didn't put up a struggle against the evil. You got tired. You're
      not a victim of the struggle but of your own weakness. Certainly you were
      young then and inexperienced. But now everything can be different. Come
      on, be an actress. You will work; you will serve in the temple of art."...
    

      "Don't be so clever, Nicolai," she interrupts. "Let's agree once for all:
      let's speak about actors, actresses, writers, but let us leave art out of
      it. You're a rare and excellent man. But you don't understand enough about
      art to consider it truly sacred. You have no flair, no ear for art.
      You've been busy all your life, and you never had time to acquire the flair.
      Really ... I don't love these conversations about art!" she continues
      nervously. "I don't love them. They've vulgarised it enough already, thank
      you."
    

      "Who's vulgarised it?"
    

      "They vulgarised it by their drunkenness, newspapers by their
      over-familiarity, clever people by philosophy."
    

      "What's philosophy got to do with it?"
    

      "A great deal. If a man philosophises, it means he doesn't understand."
    

      So that it should not come to bitter words, I hasten to change the
      subject, and then keep silence for a long while. It's not till we come out
      of the forest and drive towards Katy's bungalow, I return to the subject
      and ask:
    

      "Still, you haven't answered me why you don't want to go on the stage?"
    

      "Really, it's cruel," she cries out, and suddenly blushes all over. "You
      want me to tell you the truth outright. Very well if ... if you will have
      it I I've no talent! No talent and ... much ambition! There you are!"
    

      After this confession, she turns her face away from me, and to hide the
      trembling of her hands, tugs at the reins.
    

      As we approach her bungalow, from a distance we see Mikhail already,
      walking about by the gate, impatiently awaiting us.
    

      "This Fiodorovich again," Katy says with annoyance. "Please take him away
      from me. I'm sick of him. He's flat.... Let him go to the deuce."
    

      Mikhail Fiodorovich ought to have gone abroad long ago, but he has
      postponed his departure every week. There have been some changes in him
      lately. He's suddenly got thin, begun to be affected by drink—a
      thing that never happened to him before, and his black eyebrows have begun
      to get grey. When our buggy stops at the gate he cannot hide his joy and
      impatience. Anxiously he helps Katy and me from the buggy, hastily asks us
      questions, laughs, slowly rubs his hands, and that gentle, prayerful, pure
      something that I used to notice only in his eyes is now poured over all
      his face. He is happy and at the same time ashamed of his happiness,
      ashamed of his habit of coming to Katy's every evening, and he finds it
      necessary to give a reason for his coming, some obvious absurdity, like:
      "I was passing on business, and I thought I'd just drop in for a second."
    

      All three of us go indoors. First we drink tea, then our old friends, the
      two packs of cards, appear on the table, with a big piece of cheese, some
      fruit, and a bottle of Crimean champagne. The subjects of conversation are
      not new, but all exactly the same as they were in the winter. The
      university, the students, literature, the theatre—all of them come
      in for it. The air thickens with slanders, and grows more dose. It is
      poisoned by the breath, not of two toads as in winter, but now by all
      three. Besides the velvety, baritone laughter and the accordion-like
      giggle, the maid who waits upon us hears also the unpleasant jarring laugh
      of a musical comedy general: "He, he, he!"
    


      V
    

      There sometimes come fearful nights with thunder, lightning, rain, and
      wind, which the peasants call "sparrow-nights." There was one such
      sparrow-night in my own personal life....
    

      I wake after midnight and suddenly leap out of bed. Somehow it seems to me
      that I am going to die immediately. I do not know why, for there is no
      single sensation in my body which points to a quick end; but a terror
      presses on my soul as though I had suddenly seen a huge, ill-boding fire
      in the sky.
    

      I light the lamp quickly and drink some water straight out of the
      decanter. Then I hurry to the window. The weather is magnificent. The air
      smells of hay and some delicious thing besides. I see the spikes of my
      garden fence, the sleepy starveling trees by the window, the road, the
      dark strip of forest. There is a calm and brilliant moon in the sky and
      not a single cloud. Serenity. Not a leaf stirs. To me it seems that
      everything is looking at me and listening for me to die.
    

      Dread seizes me. I shut the window and run to the bed, I feel for my
      pulse. I cannot find it in my wrist; I seek it in my temples, my chin, my
      hand again. They are all cold and slippery with sweat. My breathing comes
      quicker and quicker; my body trembles, all my bowels are stirred, and my
      face and forehead feel as though a cobweb had settled on them.
    

      What shall I do? Shall I call my family? No use. I do not know what my
      wife and Liza will do when they come in to me.
    

      I hide my head under the pillow, shut my eyes and wait, wait.... My spine
      is cold. It almost contracts within me. And I feel that death will
      approach me only from behind, very quietly.
    

      "Kivi, kivi." A squeak sounds in the stillness of the night. I do not know
      whether it is in my heart or in the street.
    

      God, how awful! I would drink some more water; but now I dread opening my
      eyes, and fear to raise my head. The terror is unaccountable, animal. I
      cannot understand why I am afraid. Is it because I want to live, or
      because a new and unknown pain awaits me?
    

      Upstairs, above the ceiling, a moan, then a laugh ... I listen. A little
      after steps sound on the staircase. Someone hurries down, then up again.
      In a minute steps sound downstairs again. Someone stops by my door and
      listens.
    

      "Who's there?" I call.
    

      The door opens. I open my eyes boldly and see my wife. Her face is pale
      and her eyes red with weeping.
    

      "You're not asleep, Nicolai Stiepanovich?" she asks.
    

      "What is it?"
    

      "For God's sake go down to Liza. Something is wrong with her."
    

      "Very well ... with pleasure," I murmur, very glad that I am not alone.
      "Very well ... immediately."
    

      As I follow my wife I hear what she tells me, and from agitation
      understand not a word. Bright spots from her candle dance over the steps
      of the stairs; our long shadows tremble; my feet catch in the skirts of my
      dressing-gown. My breath goes, and it seems to me that someone is chasing
      me, trying to seize my back. "I shall die here on the staircase, this
      second," I think, "this second." But we have passed the staircase, the
      dark hall with the Italian window and we go into Liza's room. She sits in
      bed in her chemise; her bare legs hang down and she moans.
    

      "Oh, my God ... oh, my God!" she murmurs, half shutting her eyes from our
      candles. "I can't, I can't."
    

      "Liza, my child," I say, "what's the matter?"
    

      Seeing me, she calls out and falls on my neck.
    

      "Papa darling," she sobs. "Papa dearest ... my sweet. I don't know what it
      is.... It hurts."
    

      She embraces me, kisses me and lisps endearments which I heard her lisp
      when she was still a baby.
    

      "Be calm, my child. God's with you," I say. "You mustn't cry. Something
      hurts me too."
    

      I try to cover her with the bedclothes; my wife gives her to drink; and
      both of us jostle in confusion round the bed. My shoulders push into hers,
      and at that moment I remember how we used to bathe our children.
    

      "But help her, help her!" my wife implores. "Do something!" And what can I
      do? Nothing. There is some weight on the girl's soul; but I understand
      nothing, know nothing and can only murmur:
    

      "It's nothing, nothing.... It will pass.... Sleep, sleep."
    

      As if on purpose a dog suddenly howls in the yard, at first low and
      irresolute, then aloud, in two voices. I never put any value on such signs
      as dogs' whining or screeching owls; but now my heart contracts painfully,
      and I hasten to explain the howling.
    

      "Nonsense," I think. "It's the influence of one organism on another. My
      great nervous strain was transmitted to my wife, to Liza, and to the dog.
      That's all. Such transmissions explain presentiments and previsions."
    

      A little later when I return to my room to write a prescription for Liza I
      no longer think that I shall die soon. My soul simply feels heavy and
      dull, so that I am even sad that I did not die suddenly. For a long while
      I stand motionless in the middle of the room, pondering what I shall
      prescribe for Liza; but the moans above the ceiling are silent and I
      decide not to write a prescription, but stand there still.
    

      There is a dead silence, a silence, as one man wrote, that rings in one's
      ears. The time goes slowly. The bars of moonshine on the windowsill do not
      move from their place, as though congealed.... The dawn is still far away.
    

      But the garden-gate creaks; someone steals in, and strips a twig from the
      starveling trees, and cautiously knocks with it on my window.
    

      "Nicolai Stiepanovich!" I hear a whisper. "Nicolai Stiepanovich!"
    

      I open the window, and I think that I am dreaming. Under the window, close
      against the wall stands a woman in a blade dress. She is brightly lighted
      by the moon and looks at me with wide eyes. Her face is pale, stem and
      fantastic in the moon, like marble. Her chin trembles.
    

      "It is I...." she says, "I ... Katy!"
    

      In the moon all women's eyes are big and black, people are taller and
      paler. Probably that is the reason why I did not recognise her in the
      first moment.
    

      "What's the matter?"
    

      "Forgive me," she says. "I suddenly felt so dreary ... I could not bear
      it. So I came here. There's a light in your window ... and I decided to
      knock.... Forgive me.... Ah, if you knew how dreary I felt! What are you
      doing now?"
    

      "Nothing. Insomnia."
    

      Her eyebrows lift, her eyes shine with tears and all her face is illumined
      as with light, with the familiar, but long unseen, look of confidence.
    

      "Nicolai Stiepanovich!" she says imploringly, stretching out both her
      hands to me. "Dear, I beg you ... I implore.... If you do not despise my
      friendship and my respect for you, then do what I implore you."
    

      "What is it?"
    

      "Take my money."
    

      "What next? What's the good of your money to me?"
    

      "You will go somewhere to be cured. You must cure yourself. You will take
      it? Yes? Dear ... Yes?"
    

      She looks into my face eagerly and repeats:
    

      "Yes? You will take it?"
    

      "No, my dear, I won't take it....", I say. "Thank you."
    

      She turns her back to me and lowers her head. Probably the tone of my
      refusal would not allow any further talk of money.
    

      "Go home to sleep," I say. "I'll see you to-morrow."
    

      "It means, you don't consider me your friend?" she asks sadly.
    

      "I don't say that. But your money is no good to me."
    

      "Forgive me," she says lowering her voice by a full octave. "I understand
      you. To be obliged to a person like me ... a retired actress... But
      good-bye."
    

      And she walks away so quickly that I have no time even to say "Good-bye."
    


      VI
    

      I am in Kharkov.
    

      Since it would be useless to fight against my present mood, and I have no
      power to do it, I made up my mind that the last days of my life shall be
      irreproachable, on the formal side. If I am not right with my family,
      which I certainly admit, I will try at least to do as it wishes. Besides I
      am lately become so indifferent that it's positively all the same, to me
      whether I go to Kharkov, or Paris, or Berditshev.
    

      I arrived here at noon and put up at a hotel not far from the cathedral.
      The train made me giddy, the draughts blew through me, and now I am
      sitting on the bed with my head in my hands waiting for the tic. I ought
      to go to my professor friends to-day, but I have neither the will nor the
      strength.
    

      The old hall-porter comes in to ask whether I have brought my own
      bed-clothes. I keep him about five minutes asking him questions about
      Gnekker, on whose account I came here. The porter happens to be
      Kharkov-born, and knows the town inside out; but he doesn't remember any
      family with the name of Gnekker. I inquire about the estate. The answer is
      the same.
    

      The clock in the passage strikes one,... two,... three.... The last months
      of my life, while I wait for death, seem to me far longer than my whole
      life. Never before could I reconcile myself to the slowness of time as I
      can now. Before, when I had to wait for a train at the station, or to sit
      at an examination, a quarter of an hour would seem an eternity. Now I can
      sit motionless in bed the whole night long, quite calmly thinking that
      there will be the same long, colourless night to-morrow, and the next
      day....
    

      In the passage the clock strikes five, six, seven.... It grows dark. There
      is dull pain in my cheek—the beginning of the tic. To occupy myself
      with thoughts, I return to my old point of view, when I was not
      indifferent, and ask: Why do I, a famous man, a privy councillor, sit in
      this little room, on this bed with a strange grey blanket? Why do I look
      at this cheap tin washstand and listen to the wretched clock jarring in
      the passage? Is all this worthy of my fame and my high position among
      people? And I answer these questions with a smile. My naÃ¯vetÃ© seems funny
      to me—the naÃ¯vetÃ© with which as a young man I exaggerated the
      value of fame and of the exclusive position which famous men enjoy. I am
      famous, my name is spoken with reverence. My portrait has appeared in
      "Niva" and in "The Universal Illustration." I've even read my biography in
      a German paper, but what of that? I sit lonely, by myself, in a strange
      city, on a strange bed, rubbing my aching cheek with my palm....
    

      Family scandals, the hardness of creditors, the rudeness of railway men,
      the discomforts of the passport system, the expensive and unwholesome food
      at the buffets, the general coarseness and roughness of people,—all
      this and a great deal more that would take too long to put down, concerns
      me as much as it concerns any bourgeois who is known only in his own
      little street. Where is the exclusiveness of my position then? We will
      admit that I am infinitely famous, that I am a hero of whom my country is
      proud. All the newspapers give bulletins of my illness, the post is
      already bringing in sympathetic addresses from my friends, my pupils, and
      the public. But all this will not save me from dying in anguish on a
      stranger's bed in utter loneliness. Of course there is no one to blame for
      this. But I must confess I do not like my popularity. I feel that it has
      deceived me.
    

      At about ten I fall asleep, and, in spite of the tic sleep soundly, and
      would sleep for a long while were I not awakened. Just after one there is
      a sudden knock on my door.
    

      "Who's there?"
    

      "A telegram."
    

      "You could have brought it to-morrow," I storm, as I take the telegram
      from the porter. "Now I shan't sleep again."
    

      "I'm sorry. There was a light in your room. I thought you were not
      asleep."
    

      I open the telegram and look first at the signature—my wife's. What
      does she want?
    

      "Gnekker married Liza secretly yesterday. Return."
    

      I read the telegram. For a long while I am not startled. Not Gnekker's or
      Liza's action frightens me, but the indifference with which I receive the
      news of their marriage. Men say that philosophers and true savants
      are indifferent. It is untrue. Indifference is the paralysis of the soul,
      premature death.
    

      I go to bed again and begin to ponder with what thoughts I can occupy
      myself. What on earth shall I think of? I seem to have thought over
      everything, and now there is nothing powerful enough to rouse my thought.
    

      When the day begins to dawn, I sit in bed clasping my knees and, for want
      of occupation I try to know myself. "Know yourself" is good, useful
      advice; but it is a pity that the ancients did not think of showing us the
      way to avail ourselves of it.
    

      Before, when I had the desire to understand somebody else, or myself, I
      used not to take into consideration actions, wherein everything is
      conditional, but desires. Tell me what you want, and I will tell you what
      you are.
    

      And now I examine myself. What do I want?
    

      I want our wives, children, friends, and pupils to love in us, not the
      name or the firm or the label, but the ordinary human beings. What
      besides? I should like to have assistants and successors. What more? I
      should like to wake in a hundred years' time, and take a look, if only
      with one eye, at what has happened to science. I should like to live ten
      years more.... What further?
    

      Nothing further. I think, think a long while and cannot make out anything
      else. However much I were to think, wherever my thoughts should stray, it
      is clear to me that the chief, all-important something is lacking in my
      desires. In my infatuation for science, my desire to live, my sitting here
      on a strange bed, my yearning to know myself, in all the thoughts,
      feelings, and ideas I form about anything, there is wanting the something
      universal which could bind all these together in one whole. Each feeling
      and thought lives detached in me, and in all my opinions about science,
      the theatre, literature, and my pupils, and in all the little pictures
      which my imagination paints, not even the most cunning analyst will
      discover what is called the general idea, or the god of the living man.
    

      And if this is not there, then nothing is there.
    

      In poverty such as this a serious infirmity, fear of death, influence of
      circumstances and people would have been enough to overthrow and shatter
      all that I formerly considered as my conception of the world, and all
      wherein I saw the meaning and joy of my life. Therefore, it is nothing
      strange that I have darkened the last months of my life by thoughts and
      feelings worthy of a slave or a savage, and that I am now indifferent and
      do not notice the dawn. If there is lacking in a man that which is higher
      and stronger than all outside influences, then verily a good cold in the
      head is enough to upset his balance and to make him see each bird an owl
      and hear a dog's whine in every sound; and all his pessimism or his
      optimism with their attendant thoughts, great and small, seem then to be
      merely symptoms and no more.
    

      I am beaten. Then it's no good going on thinking, no good talking. I shall
      sit and wait in silence for what will come.
    

      In the morning the porter brings me tea and the local paper. Mechanically
      I read the advertisements on the first page, the leader, the extracts from
      newspapers and magazines, the local news ... Among other things I find in
      the local news an item like this: "Our famous scholar, emeritus professor
      Nicolai Stiepanovich arrived in Kharkov yesterday by the express, and
      stayed at——hotel."
    

      Evidently big names are created to live detached from those who bear them.
      Now my name walks in Kharkov undisturbed. In some three months it will
      shine as bright as the sun itself, inscribed in letters of gold on my
      tombstone—at a time when I myself will be under the sod....
    

      A faint knock at the door. Somebody wants me.
    

      "Who's there? Come in!"
    

      The door opens. I step back in astonishment, and hasten to pull my
      dressing gown together. Before me stands Katy.
    

      "How do you do?" she says, panting from running up the stairs. "You didn't
      expect me? I ... I've come too."
    

      She sits down and continues, stammering and looking away from me. "Why
      don't you say 'Good morning'? I arrived too ... to-day. I found out you
      were at this hotel, and came to see you."
    

      "I'm delighted to see you," I say shrugging my shoulders. "But I'm
      surprised. You might have dropped straight from heaven. What are you doing
      here?"
    

      "I?... I just came."
    

      Silence. Suddenly she gets up impetuously and comes over to me.
    

      "Nicolai Stiepanich!" she says, growing pale and pressing her hands to her
      breast. "Nicolai Stiepanich! I can't go on like this any longer. I can't.
      For God's sake tell me now, immediately. What shall I do? Tell me, what
      shall I do?"
    

      "What can I say? I am beaten. I can say nothing."
    

      "But tell me, I implore you," she continues, out of breath and trembling
      all over her body. "I swear to you, I can't go on like this any longer. I
      haven't the strength."
    

      She drops into a chair and begins to sob. She throws her head back, wrings
      her hands, stamps with her feet; her hat falls from her head and dangles
      by its string, her hair is loosened.
    

      "Help me, help," she implores. "I can't bear it any more."
    

      She takes a handkerchief out of her little travelling bag and with it
      pulls out some letters which fall from her knees to the floor. I pick them
      up from the floor and recognise on one of them Mikhail Fiodorovich's
      hand-writing, and accidentally read part of a word: "passionat...."
    

      "There's nothing that I can say to you, Katy," I say.
    

      "Help me," she sobs, seizing my hand and kissing it. "You're my father, my
      only friend. You're wise and learned, and you've lived long! You were a
      teacher. Tell me what to do."
    

      I am bewildered and surprised, stirred by her sobbing, and I can hardly
      stand upright.
    

      "Let's have some breakfast, Katy," I say with a constrained smile.
    

      Instantly I add in a sinking voice:
    

      "I shall be dead soon, Katy...."
    

      "Only one word, only one word," she weeps and stretches out her hands to
      me. "What shall I do?"
    

      "You're a queer thing, really....", I murmur. "I can't understand it. Such
      a clever woman and suddenly—weeping...."
    

      Comes silence. Katy arranges her hair, puts on her hat, then crumples her
      letters and stuffs them in her little bag, all in silence and unhurried.
      Her face, her bosom and her gloves are wet with tears, but her expression
      is dry already, stern.... I look at her and am ashamed that I am happier
      than she. It was but a little while before my death, in the ebb of my
      life, that I noticed in myself the absence of what our friends the
      philosophers call the general idea; but this poor thing's soul has never
      known and never will know shelter all her life, all her life.
    

      "Katy, let's have breakfast," I say.
    

      "No, thank you," she answers coldly.
    

      One minute more passes in silence.
    

      "I don't like Kharkov," I say. "It's too grey. A grey city."
    

      "Yes ... ugly.... I'm not here for long.... On my way. I leave to-day."
    

      "For where?"
    

      "For the Crimea ... I mean, the Caucasus."
    

      "So. For long?"
    

      "I don't know."
    

      Katy gets up and gives me her hand with a cold smile, looking away from
      me.
    

      I would like to ask her: "That means you won't be at my funeral?" But she
      does not look at me; her hand is cold and like a stranger's. I escort her
      to the door in silenqe.... She goes out of my room and walks down the long
      passage, without looking back. She knows that my eyes are following her,
      and probably on the landing she will look back.
    

      No, she did not look back. The black dress showed for the last time, her
      steps were stilled.... Goodbye, my treasure!
    





      I
    

      The medical student Mayer, and Ribnikov, a student at the Moscow school of
      painting, sculpture, and architecture, came one evening to their friend
      Vassiliev, law student, and proposed that he should go with them to S——v
      Street. For a long while Vassiliev did not agree, but eventually dressed
      himself and went with them.
    

      Unfortunate women he knew only by hearsay and from books, and never once
      in his life had he been in the houses where they live. He knew there were
      immoral women who were forced by the pressure of disastrous circumstances—environment,
      bad up-bringing, poverty, and the like—to sell their honour for
      money. They do not know pure love, have no children and no legal rights;
      mothers and sisters mourn them for dead, science treats them as an evil,
      men are familiar with them. But notwithstanding all this they do not lose
      the image and likeness of God. They all acknowledge their sin and hope for
      salvation. They are free to avail themselves of every means of salvation.
      True, Society does not forgive people their past, but with God Mary of
      Egypt is not lower than the other saints. Whenever Vassiliev recognised an
      unfortunate woman in the street by her costume or her manner, or saw a
      picture of one in a comic paper, there came into his mind every time a
      story he once read somewhere: a pure and heroic young man falls in love
      with an unfortunate woman and asks her to be his wife, but she,
      considering herself unworthy of such happiness, poisons herself.
    

      Vassiliev lived in one of the streets off the Tverskoi boulevard. When he
      and his friends came out of the house it was about eleven o'clock—the
      first snow had just fallen and all nature was under the spell of this new
      snow; The air smelt of snow, the snow cracked softly under foot, the
      earth, the roofs, the trees, the benches on the boulevards—all were
      soft, white, and young. Owing to this the houses had a different look from
      yesterday, the lamps burned brighter, the air was more transparent, the
      clatter of the cabs was dulled and there entered into the soul with the
      fresh, easy, frosty air a feeling like the white, young, feathery snow.
      "To these sad shores unknowing" the medico began to sing in a pleasant
      tenor, "An unknown power entices...."
    

      "Behold the mill" ... the painter's voice took him up, "it is now fall'n
      to ruin."
    

      "Behold the mill, it is now fall'n to ruin," the medico repeated, raising
      his eyebrows and sadly shaking his head.
    

      He was silent for a while, passed his hand over his forehead trying to
      recall the words, and began to sing in a loud voice and so well that the
      passers-by looked back.
    

      "Here, long ago, came free, free love to me"...
    

      All three went into a restaurant and without taking off their coats they
      each had two thimblefuls of vodka at the bar. Before drinking the second,
      Vassiliev noticed a piece of cork in his Vodka, lifted the glass to his
      eye, looked at it for a long while with a short-sighted frown. The medico
      misunderstood his expression and said—
    

      "Well, what are you staring at? No philosophy, please. Vodka's made to be
      drunk, caviare to be eaten, women to sleep with, snow to walk on. Live
      like a man for one evening."
    

      "Well, I've nothing to say," said Vassiliev laughingly, "I'm not
      refusing?"
    

      The vodka warmed his breast. He looked at his friends, admired and envied
      them. How balanced everything is in these healthy, strong, cheerful
      people. Everything in their minds and souls is smooth and rounded off.
      They sing, have a passion for the theatre, paint, talk continually, and
      drink, and they never have a headache the next day. They are romantic and
      dissolute, sentimental and insolent; they can work and go on the loose and
      laugh at nothing and talk rubbish; they are hot-headed, honest, heroic and
      as human beings not a bit worse than Vassiliev, who watches his every step
      and word, who is careful, cautious, and able to give the smallest trifle
      the dignity of a problem. And he made tip his mind if only for one evening
      to live like his friends, to let himself go, and be free from his own
      control. Must he drink vodka? He'll drink, even if his head falls to
      pieces to-morrow. Must he be taken to women? He'll go. He'll laugh, play
      the fool, and give a joking answer to disapproving passers-by.
    

      He came out of the restaurant laughing. He liked his friends—one in
      a battered hat with a wide brim who aped aesthetic disorder; the other in
      a sealskin cap, not very poor, with a pretence of learned Bohemia. He
      liked the snow, the paleness, the lamp-lights, the dear black prints which
      the passers' feet left on the snow. He liked the air, and above all the
      transparent, tender, naive, virgin tone which can be seen in nature only
      twice in the year: when everything is covered in snow, on the bright days
      in spring, and on moonlight nights when the ice breaks on the river.
    

      "To these sad shores unknowing," he began to sing sotto-voce, "An
      unknown power entices."
    

      And all the way for some reason or other he and his friends had this
      melody on their lips. All three hummed it mechanically out of time with
      each other.
    

      Vassiliev Imagined how in about ten minutes he and his friends would knock
      at a door, how they would stealthily walk through-the narrow little
      passages and dark rooms to the women, how he would take advantage of the
      dark, suddenly strike a match, and see lit up a suffering face and a
      guilty smile. There he will surely find a fair or a dark woman in a white
      nightgown with her hair loose. She will be frightened of the light,
      dreadfully confused and say: "Good God! What are you doing? Blow it out!"
      All this was frightening, but curious and novel.
    


      II
    

      The friends turned out of Trubnoi Square into the Grachovka and soon
      arrived at the street which Vassiliev knew only from hearsay. Seeing two
      rows of houses with brightly lighted windows and wide open doors, and
      hearing the gay sound of pianos and fiddles—sounds which flew out of
      all the doors and mingled in a strange confusion, as if somewhere in the
      darkness over the roof-tops an unseen orchestra were tuning, Vassiliev was
      bewildered and said:
    

      "What a lot of houses!"
    

      "What's that?" said the medico. "There are ten times as many in London.
      There are a hundred thousand of these women there."
    

      The cabmen sat on their boxes quiet and indifferent as in other streets;
      on the pavement walked the same passers-by. No one was in a hurry; no one
      hid his face in his collar; no one shook his head reproachfully. And in
      this indifference, in the confused sound of the pianos and fiddles, in the
      bright windows and wide-open doors, something very free, impudent, bold
      and daring could be felt. It must have been the same as this in the old
      times on the slave-markets, as gay and as noisy; people looked and walked
      with the same indifference.
    

      "Let's begin right at the beginning," said the painter.
    

      The friends walked into a narrow little passage lighted by a single lamp
      with a reflector. When they opened the door a man in a black jacket rose
      lazily from the yellow sofa in the hall. He had an unshaven lackey's face
      and sleepy eyes. The place smelt like a laundry, and of vinegar. From the
      hall a door led into a brightly lighted room. The medico and the painter
      stopped in the doorway, stretched out their necks and peeped into the room
      together:
    

      "Buona sera, signore, Rigoletto—huguenote—traviata!—"
      the painter began, making a theatrical bow.
    

      "Havanna—blackbeetlano—pistoletto!" said the medico, pressing
      his hat to his heart and bowing low.
    

      Vassiliev kept behind them. He wanted to bow theatrically too and say
      something silly. But he only smiled, felt awkward and ashamed, and awaited
      impatiently what was to follow. In the door appeared a little fair girl of
      seventeen or eighteen, with short hair, wearing a short blue dress with a
      white bow on her breast.
    

      "What are you standing in the door for?" she said. "Take off your
      overcoats and come into the salon."
    

      The medico and the painter went into the salon, still speaking Italian.
      Vassiliev followed them irresolutely.
    

      "Gentlemen, take off your overcoats," said the lackey stiffly. "You're not
      allowed in as you are."
    

      Besides the fair girl there was another woman in the salon, very stout and
      tall, with a foreign face and bare arms. She sat by the piano, with a game
      of patience spread on her knees. She took no notice of the guests.
    

      "Where are the other girls?" asked the medico.
    

      "They're drinking tea," said the fair one. "Stiepan," she called out. "Go
      and tell the girls some students have come!"
    

      A little later a third girl entered, in a bright red dress with blue
      stripes. Her face was thickly and unskilfully painted. Her forehead was
      hidden under her hair. She stared with dull, frightened eyes. As she came
      she immediately began to sing in a strong hoarse contralto. After her a
      fourth girl. After her a fifth.
    

      In all this Vassiliev saw nothing new or curious. It seemed to him that he
      had seen before, and more than once, this salon, piano, cheap gilt mirror,
      the white bow, the dress with blue stripes and the stupid, indifferent
      faces. But of darkness, quiet, mystery, and guilty smile—of all he
      had expected to meet here and which frightened him—he did not see
      even a shadow.
    

      Everything was commonplace, prosaic, and dull. Only one thing provoked his
      curiosity a little, that was the terrible, as it were intentional lack of
      taste, which was seen in the overmantels, the absurd pictures, the dresses
      and the White bow. In this lack of taste there was something
      characteristic and singular.
    

      "How poor and foolish it all is!" thought Vassiliev. "What is there in all
      this rubbish to tempt a normal man, to provoke him into committing a
      frightful sin, to buy a living soul for a rouble? I can understand anyone
      sinning for the sake of splendour, beauty, grace, passion; but what is
      there here? What tempts people here? But ... it's no good thinking!"
    

      "Whiskers, stand me champagne." The fair one turned to him.
    

      Vassiliev suddenly blushed.
    

      "With pleasure," he said, bowing politely. "But excuse me if I ... I don't
      drink with you, I don't drink."
    

      Five minutes after the friends were off to another house.
    

      "Why did you order drinks?" stormed the medico. "What a millionaire,
      flinging six roubles into the gutter like that for nothing at all."
    

      "Why shouldn't I give her pleasure if she wants it?" said Vassiliev,
      justifying himself.
    

      "You didn't give her any pleasure. Madame got that. It's Madame who tells
      them to ask the guests for drinks. She makes by it."
    

      "Behold the mill," the painter began to sing, "Now fall'n to ruin...."
    

      When they came to another house the friends stood outside in the
      vestibule, but did not enter the salon. As in the first house, a figure
      rose up from the sofa in the hall, in a black jacket, with a sleepy
      lackey's face. As he looked at this lackey, at his face and shabby jacket,
      Vassiliev thought: "What must an ordinary simple Russian go through before
      Fate casts him up here? Where was he before, and what was he doing? What
      awaits him? Is he married, where's his mother, and does she know he's a
      lackey here?" Thenceforward in every house Vassiliev involuntarily turned
      his attention to the lackey first of all.
    

      In one of the houses, it seemed to be the fourth, the lackey was a dry
      little, puny fellow, with a chain across his waistcoat. He was reading a
      newspaper and took no notice of the guests at all. Glancing at his face,
      Vassiliev had the idea that a fellow with a face like that could steal and
      murder and perjure. And indeed the face was interesting: a big forehead,
      grey eyes, a flat little nose, small close-set teeth, and the expression
      on his face dull and impudent at once, like a puppy hard on a hare.
      Vassiliev had the thought that he would like to touch this lackey's hair:
      is it rough or soft f It must be rough like a dog's.
    


      III
    

      Because he had had two glasses the painter suddenly got rather drunk, and
      unnaturally lively.
    

      "Let's go to another place," he added, waving his hands. "I'll introduce
      you to the best!"
    

      When he had taken his friends into the house which was according to him
      the best, he proclaimed a persistent desire to dance a quadrille. The
      medico began to grumble that they would have to pay the musicians a rouble
      but agreed to be his vis-Ã -vis. The dance began.
    

      It was just as bad in the best house as in the worst. Just the same
      mirrors and pictures were here, the same coiffures and dresses. Looking
      round at the furniture and the costumes Vassiliev now understood that it
      was not lack of taste, but something that might be called the particular
      taste and style of S——v Street, quite impossible to find
      anywhere else, something complete, not accidental, evolved in time. After
      he had been to eight houses he no longer wondered at the colour of the
      dresses or the long trains, or at the bright bows, or the sailor dresses,
      or the thick violent painting of the cheeks; he understood that all this
      was in harmony, that if only one woman dressed herself humanly, or one
      decent print hung on the wall, then the general tone of the whole street
      would suffer.
    

      How badly they manage the business? Can't they really understand that vice
      is only fascinating when it is beautiful and secret, hidden under the
      cloak of virtue? Modest black dresses, pale faces, sad smiles, and
      darkness act more strongly than this clumsy tinsel. Idiots! If they don't
      understand it themselves, their guests ought to teach them....
    

      A girl in a Polish costume trimmed with white fur came up close to him and
      sat down by his side.
    

      "Why don't you dance, my brown-haired darling?" she asked. "What do you
      fed so bored about?"
    

      "Because it is boring."
    

      "Stand me a ChÃ¢teau Lafitte, then you won't be bored."
    

      Vassiliev made no answer. For a little while he was silent, then he asked:
    

      "What time do you go to bed as a rule?"
    

      "Six."
    

      "When do you get up?"
    

      "Sometimes two, sometimes three."
    

      "And after you get up what do you do?"
    

      "We drink coffee. We have dinner at seven."
    

      "And what do you have for dinner?"
    

      "Soup or schi as a rule, beef-steak, dessert. Our madame keeps the
      girls well. But what are you asking all this for?"
    

      "Just to have a talk...."
    

      Vassiliev wanted to ask about all sorts of things. He had a strong desire
      to find out where she came from, were her parents alive, and did they know
      she was here; how she got into the house; was she happy and contented, or
      gloomy and depressed with dark thoughts. Does she ever hope to escape....
      But he could not possibly think how to begin, or how to put his questions
      without seeming indiscreet. He thought for a long while and asked:
    

      "How old are you?"
    

      "Eighty," joked the girl, looking and laughing at the tricks the painter
      was doing with his hands and feet.
    

      She suddenly giggled and uttered a long filthy expression aloud so that
      every one could hear.
    

      Vassiliev, terrified, not knowing how to look, began to laugh uneasily. He
      alone smiled: all the others, his friends, the musicians and the women—paid
      no attention to his neighbour. They might never have heard.
    

      "Stand me a Lafitte," said the girl again.
    

      Vassiliev was suddenly repelled by her white trimming and her voice and
      left her. It seemed to him close and hot. His heart began to beat slowly
      and violently, like a hammer, one, two, three.
    

      "Let's get out of here," he said, pulling the painter's sleeve.
    

      "Wait. Let's finish it."
    

      While the medico and the painter were finishing their quadrille,
      Vassiliev, in order to avoid the women, eyed the musicians. The pianist
      was a nice old man with spectacles, with a face like Marshal Basin; the
      fiddler a young man with a short, fair beard dressed in the latest
      fashion. The young man was not stupid or starved, on the contrary he
      looked clever, young and fresh. He was dressed with a touch of
      originality, and played with emotion. Problem: how did he and the decent
      old man get here? Why aren't they ashamed to sit here? What do they think
      about when they look at the women?
    

      If the piano and the fiddle were played by ragged, hungry, gloomy, drunken
      creatures, with thin stupid faces, then their presence would perhaps be
      intelligible. As it was, Vassiliev could understand. nothing. Into his
      memory came the story that he had read about the unfortunate woman, and
      now he found that the human figure with the guilty smile had nothing to do
      with this. It seemed to him that they were not unfortunate women that he
      saw, but they belonged to another, utterly different world, foreign and
      inconceivable to him; if he had seen this world on the stage or read about
      it in a book he would never have believed it.... The girl with the white
      trimming giggled again and said something disgusting aloud. He felt sick,
      blushed, and went out:
    

      "Wait. We're coming too," cried the painter.
    


      IV
    

      "I had a talk with my mam'selle while we were dancing," said the
      medico when all three came into the street. "The subject was her first
      love. He was a bookkeeper in Smolensk with a wife and five
      children. She was seventeen and lived with her pa and ma who kept a soap
      and candle shop."
    

      "How did he conquer her heart?" asked Vassiliev.
    

      "He bought her fifty roubles'-worth of underclothes—Lord knows
      what!"
    

      "However could he get her love-story out of his girl?" thought Vassiliev.
      "I can't. My dear chaps, I'm off home," he said.
    

      "Why?"
    

      "Because I don't know how to get on here. I'm bored and disgusted. What is
      there amusing about it? If they were only human beings; but they're
      savages and beasts. I'm going, please."
    

      "Grisha darling, please," the painter said with a sob in his voice,
      pressing close to Vassiliev, "let's go to one more—then to Hell with
      them. Do come, Grigor."
    

      They prevailed on Vassiliev and led him up a staircase. The carpet and the
      gilded balustrade, the porter who opened the door, the panels which
      decorated the hall, were still in the same S——v Street style,
      but here it was perfected and imposing.
    

      "Really I'm going home," said Vassiliev, taking off his overcoat.
    

      "Darling, please, please," said the painter and kissed him on the neck.
      "Don't be so faddy, Grigri—be a pal. Together we came, together we
      go. What a beast you are though!"
    

      "I can wait for you in the street. My God, it's disgusting here."
    

      "Please, please.... You just look on, see, just look on."
    

      "One should look at things objectively," said the medico seriously.
    

      Vassiliev entered the salon and sat down. There were many more guests
      besides him and his friends: two infantry officers, a grey, bald-headed
      gentleman with gold spectacles, two young clean-shaven men from the
      Surveyors' Institute, and a very drunk man with an actor's face. All the
      girls were looking after these guests and took no notice of Vassiliev.
      Only one of them dressed like AÃ¯da glanced at him sideways, smiled at
      something and said with a yawn:
    

      "So the dark one's come."
    

      Vassiliev's heart was beating and his face was burning. He felt ashamed
      for being there, disgusted and tormented. He was tortured by the thought
      that he, a decent and affectionate man (so he considered himself up till
      now), despised these women and felt nothing towards them but repulsion. He
      could not feel pity for them or for the musicians or the lackeys.
    

      "It's because I don't try to understand them," he thought. "They're all
      more like beasts than human beings; but all the same they are human
      beings. They've got souls. One should understand them first, then judge
      them."
    

      "Grisha, don't go away. Wait for us," called the painter; and he
      disappeared somewhere.
    

      Soon the medico disappeared also.
    

      "Yes, one should try to understand. It's no good, otherwise," thought
      Vassiliev, and he began to examine intently the face of each girl, looking
      for the guilty smile. But whether he could not read faces or because none
      of these women felt guilty he saw in each face only a dull look of common,
      vulgar boredom and satiety. Stupid eyes, stupid smiles, harsh, stupid
      voices, impudent gestures—and nothing else. Evidently every woman
      had in her past a love romance with a bookkeeper and fifty roubles'-worth
      of underclothes. And in the present the only good things in life were
      coffee, a three-course dinner, wine, quadrilles, and sleeping till two in
      the afternoon....
    

      Finding not one guilty smile, Vassiliev began to examine them to see if
      even one looked clever and his attention was arrested by one pale, rather
      tired face. It was that of a dark woman no longer young, wearing a dress
      scattered with spangles. She sat in a chair staring at the floor and
      thinking of something. Vassiliev paced up and down and then sat down
      beside her as if by accident.
    

      "One must begin with something trivial," he thought, "and gradually pass
      on to serious conversation...."
    

      "What a beautiful little dress you have on," he said, and touched the gold
      fringe of her scarf with his finger.
    

      "It's all right," said the dark woman.
    

      "Where do you come from?"
    

      "I? A long way. From Tchernigov."
    

      "It's a nice part."
    

      "It always is, where you don't happen to be."
    

      "What a pity I can't describe nature," thought Vassiliev. "I'd move her by
      descriptions of Tchernigov. She must love it if she was born there."
    

      "Do you feel lonely here?" he asked.
    

      "Of course I'm lonely."
    

      "Why don't you go away from here, if you're lonely?"
    

      "Where shall I go to? Start begging, eh?"
    

      "It's easier to beg than to live here."
    

      "Where did you get that idea? Have you been a beggar?"
    

      "I begged, when I hadn't enough to pay my university fees; and even if I
      hadn't begged it's easy enough to understand. A beggar is a free man, at
      any rate, and you're a slave."
    

      The dark woman stretched herself, and followed with sleepy eyes the lackey
      who carried a tray of glasses and soda-water.
    

      "Stand us a champagne," she said, and yawned again.
    

      "Champagne," said Vassiliev. "What would happen if your mother or your
      brother suddenly came in? What would you say? And what would they say? You
      would say 'champagne' then."
    

      Suddenly the noise of crying was heard. From the next room where the
      lackey had carried the soda-water, a fair man rushed out with a red face
      and angry eyes. He was followed by the tall, stout madame, who screamed in
      a squeaky voice:
    

      "No one gave you permission to slap the girls in the face. Better class
      than you come here, and never slap a girl. You bounder!"
    

      Followed an uproar. Vassiliev was scared and went white. In the next room
      some one wept, sobbing, sincerely, as only the insulted weep. And he
      understood that indeed human beings lived here, actually human beings, who
      get offended, suffer, weep, and ask for help. The smouldering hatred, the
      feeling of repulsion, gave way to an acute sense of pity and anger against
      the wrong-doer. He rushed into the room from which the weeping came.
      Through the rows of bottles which stood on the marble table-top he saw a
      suffering tear-stained face, stretched out his hands towards this face,
      stepped to the table and instantly gave a leap back in terror. The sobbing
      woman was dead-drunk.
    

      As he made his way through the noisy crowd, gathered round the fair man,
      his heart failed him, he lost his courage like a boy, and it seemed to him
      that in this foreign, inconceivable world, they wanted to run after him,
      to beat him, to abuse him with foul words. He tore down his coat from the
      peg and rushed headlong down the stairs.
    


      V
    

      Pressing dose to the fence, he stood near to the house and waited for his
      friends to come out. The sounds of the pianos and fiddles, gay, bold,
      impudent and sad, mingled into chaos in the air, and this confusion was,
      as before, as if an unseen orchestra were tuning in the dark over the
      roof-tops. If he looked up towards the darkness, then all the background
      was scattered with white, moving points: it was snowing. The flakes,
      coming into the light, spun lazily in the air like feathers, and still
      more lazily fell. Flakes of snow crowded whirling about Vassiliev, and
      hung on his beard, his eyelashes, his eyebrows. The cabmen, the horses,
      and the passers-by, all were white.
    

      "How dare the snow fall in this street?" thought Vassiliev. "A curse on
      these houses."
    

      Because of his headlong rush down the staircase his feet failed him from
      weariness; he was out of breath as if he had climbed a mountain. His heart
      beat so loud that he could hear it. A longing came over him to get out of
      this street as soon as possible and go home; but still stronger was his
      desire to wait for his friends and to vent upon them his feeling of
      heaviness.
    

      He had not understood many things in the houses. The souls of the
      perishing women were to him a mystery as before; but it was dear to him
      that the business was much worse than one would have thought. If the
      guilty woman who poisoned herself was called a prostitute, then it was
      hard to find a suitable name for all these creatures, who danced to the
      muddling music and said long, disgusting phrases. They were not perishing;
      they were already done for.
    

      "Vice is here," he thought; "but there is neither confession of sin nor
      hope of salvation. They are bought and sold, drowned in wine and torpor,
      and they are dull and indifferent as sheep and do not understand. My God,
      my God!"
    

      It was so dear to him that all that which is called human dignity,
      individuality, the image and likeness of God, was here dragged down to the
      gutter, as they say of drunkards, and that not only the street and the
      stupid women were to blame for it.
    

      A crowd of students white with snow, talking and laughing gaily, passed
      by. One of them, a tall, thin man, peered into Vassiliev's face and said
      drunkenly, "He's one of ours. Logged, old man? Aha! my lad. Never mind.
      Walk up, never say die, uncle."
    

      He took Vassiliev by the shoulders and pressed his cold wet moustaches to
      his cheek, then slipped, staggered, brandished his arms, and cried out:
    

      "Steady there—don't fall."
    

      Laughing, he ran to join his comrades.
    

      Through the noise the painter's voice became audible.
    

      "You dare beat women! I won't have it. Go to Hell. You're regular swine."
    

      The medico appeared at the door of the house. He glanced round and on
      seeing Vassiliev, said in alarm:
    

      "Is that you? My God, it's simply impossible to go anywhere with Yegor. I
      can't understand a chap like that. He kicked up a row—can't you
      hear? Yegor," he called from the door. "Yegor!"
    

      "I won't have you hitting women." The painter's shrill voice was audible
      again from upstairs.
    

      Something heavy and bulky tumbled down the staircase. It was the painter
      coming head over heels. He had evidently been thrown out.
    

      He lifted himself up from the ground, dusted his hat, and with an angry
      indignant face, shook his fist at the upstairs.
    

      "Scoundrels! Butchers! Bloodsuckers! I won't have you hitting a weak,
      drunken woman. Ah, you...."
    

      "Yegor ... Yegor!" the medico began to implore, "I give my word I'll never
      go out with you again. Upon my honour, I won't."
    

      The painter gradually calmed, and the friends went home.
    

      "To these sad shores unknowing"—the medico began—"An unknown
      power entices...."
    

      "Behold the mill," the painter sang with him after a pause, "Now fallen
      into ruin." How the snow is falling, most Holy Mother. Why did you go
      away, Grisha? You're a coward; you're only an old woman."
    

      Vassiliev was walking behind his friends. He stared at their backs and
      thought: "One of two things: either prostitution only seems to us an evil
      and we exaggerate it, or if prostitution is really such an evil as is
      commonly thought, these charming friends of mine are just as much slavers,
      violators, and murderers as the inhabitants of Syria and Cairo whose
      photographs appear in 'The Field.' They're singing, laughing, arguing
      soundly now, but haven't they just been exploiting starvation, ignorance,
      and stupidity? They have, I saw them at it. Where does their humanity,
      their science, and their painting come in, then? The science, art, and
      lofty sentiments of these murderers remind me of the lump of fat in the
      story. Two robbers killed a beggar in a forest; they began to divide his
      clothes between themselves and found in his bag a lump of pork fat. 'In
      the nick of time,' said one of them. 'Let's have a bite!' 'How can you?'
      the other cried in terror. 'Have you forgotten to-day's Friday?' So they
      refrained from eating. After having cut the man's throat they walked out
      of the forest confident that they were pious fellows. These two are just
      the same. When they've paid for women they go and imagine they're painters
      and scholars....
    

      "Listen, you two," he said angrily and sharply. "Why do you go to those
      places? Can't you understand how horrible they are? Your medicine tells
      you every one of these women dies prematurely from consumption or
      something else; your arts tell you that she died morally still earlier.
      Each of them dies because during her lifetime she accepts on an average,
      let us say, five hundred men. Each of them is killed by five hundred men,
      and you're amongst the five hundred. Now if each of you comes here and to
      places like this two hundred and fifty times in his lifetime, then it
      means that between you you have killed one woman. Can't you understand
      that? Isn't it horrible?"
    

      "Ah, isn't this awful, my God?"
    

      "There, I knew it would end like this," said the painter frowning. "We
      oughtn't to have had anything to do with this fool of a blockhead. I
      suppose you think your head's full of great thoughts and great ideas now.
      Devil knows what they are, but they're not ideas. You're staring at me now
      with hatred and disgust; but if you want my opinion you'd better build
      twenty more of the houses than look like that. There's more vice in your
      look than in the whole street. Let's dear out, Volodya, damn him! He's a
      fool. He's a blockhead, and that's all he is."
    

      "Human beings are always killing each other," said the medico. "That is
      immoral, of course. But philosophy won't help you. Good-bye!"
    

      The friends parted at Trubnoi Square and went their way. Left alone,
      Vassiliev began to stride along the boulevard. He was frightened of the
      dark, frightened of the snow, which fell to the earth in little flakes,
      but seemed to long to cover the whole world; he was frightened of the
      street-lamps, which glimmered faintly through the clouds of snow. An
      inexplicable faint-hearted fear possessed his soul. Now and then people
      passed him; but he gave a start and stepped aside. It seemed to him that
      from everywhere there came and stared at him women, only women....
    

      "It's coming on," he thought, "I'm going to have a fit."
    


      VI
    

      At home he lay on his bed and began to talk, shivering all over his body.
    

      "Live women, live.... My God, they're alive."
    

      He sharpened the edge of his imagination in every possible way. Now he was
      the brother of an unfortunate, now her father. Now he was himself a fallen
      woman, with painted cheeks; and all this terrified him.
    

      It seemed to him somehow that he must solve this question immediately, at
      all costs, and that the problem was not strange to him, but was his own.
      He made a great effort, conquered his despair, and, sitting on the side of
      the bed, his head clutched in his hands, he began to think:
    

      How could all the women he had seen that night be saved? The process of
      solving a problem was familiar to him as to a learned person; and
      notwithstanding all his excitement he kept strictly to this process. He
      recalled to mind the history of the question, its literature, and just
      after three o'clock he was pacing up and down, trying to remember all the
      experiments which are practised nowadays for the salvation of women. He
      had a great many good friends who lived in furnished rooms, Falzfein,
      Galyashkin, Nechaiev, Yechkin ... not a few among them were honest and
      self-sacrificing, and some of them had attempted to save these women....
    

      All these few attempts, thought Vassiliev, rare attempts, may be divided
      into three groups. Some having rescued a woman from a brothel hired a room
      for her, bought her a sewing-machine and she became a dressmaker, and the
      man who saved her kept her for his mistress, openly or otherwise, but
      later when he had finished his studies and was going away, he would hand
      her over to another decent fellow. So the fallen woman remained fallen.
      Others after having bought her out also hired a room for her, bought the
      inevitable sewing-machine and started her off reading and writing and
      preached at her. The woman sits and sews as long as it is novel and
      amusing, but later, when she is bored, she begins to receive men secretly,
      or runs back to where she can sleep till three in the afternoon, drink
      coffee, and eat till she is full. Finally, the most ardent and
      self-sacrificing take a bold, determined step. They marry, and when the
      impudent, self-indulgent, stupefied creature becomes a wife, a lady of the
      house, and then a mother, her life and outlook are utterly changed, and in
      the wife and mother it is hard to recognise the unfortunate woman. Yes,
      marriage is the best, it may be the only, resource.
    

      "But it's impossible," Vassiliev said aloud and threw himself down on his
      bed. "First of all, I could not marry one. One would have to be a saint to
      be able to do it, unable to hate, not knowing disgust. But let us suppose
      that the painter, the medico, and I got the better of our feelings and
      married, that all these women got married, what is the result? What kind
      of effect follows? The result is that while the women get married here in
      Moscow, the Smolensk bookkeeper seduces a fresh lot, and these will pour
      into the empty places, together with women from Saratov, Nijni-Novgorod,
      Warsaw.... And what happens to the hundred thousand in London? What can be
      done with those in Hamburg?
    

      The oil in the lamp was used up and the lamp began to smell. Vassiliev did
      not notice it. Again he began to pace up and down, thinking. Now he put
      the question differently. What can be done to remove the demand for fallen
      women? For this it is necessary that the men who buy and kill them should
      at once begin to feel all the immorality of their rÃ´le of
      slave-owners, and this should terrify them. It is necessary to save the
      men.
    

      Science and art apparently won't do, thought Vassiliev. There is only one
      way out—to be an apostle.
    

      And he began to dream how he would stand to-morrow evening at the corner
      of the street and say to each passer-by: "Where are you going and what
      for? Fear God!"
    

      He would turn to the indifferent cabmen and say to them:
    

      "Why are you standing here? Why don't you revolt? You do believe in God,
      don't you? And you do know that this is a crime, and that people will go
      to Hell for this? Why do you keep quiet, then? True, the women are
      strangers to you, but they have fathers and brothers exactly the same as
      you...."
    

      Some friend of Vassiliev's once said of him that he was a man of talent.
      There is a talent for writing, for the theatre, for painting; but
      Vassiliev's was peculiar, a talent for humanity. He had a fine and noble
      flair for every kind of suffering. As a good actor reflects in
      himself the movement and voice of another, so Vassiliev could reflect in
      himself another's pain. Seeing tears, he wept. With a sick person, he
      himself became sick and moaned. If he saw violence done, it seemed to him
      that he was the victim. He was frightened like a child, and, frightened,
      ran for help. Another's pain roused him, excited him, threw him into a
      state of ecstasy....
    

      Whether the friend was right I do not know, but what happened to Vassiliev
      when it seemed to him that the question was solved was very much like an
      ecstasy. He sobbed, laughed, said aloud the things he would say to-morrow,
      felt a burning love for the men who would listen to him and stand by his
      side at the corner of the street, preaching. He sat down to write to them;
      he made vows.
    

      All this was the more like an ecstasy in that it did not last. Vassiliev
      was soon tired. The London women, the Hamburg women, those from Warsaw,
      crushed him with their mass, as the mountains crush the earth. He quailed
      before this mass; he lost himself; he remembered he had no gift for
      speaking, that he was timid and faint-hearted, that strange people would
      hardly want to listen to and understand him, a law-student in his third
      year, a frightened and insignificant figure. The true apostleship
      consisted, not only in preaching, but also in deeds....
    

      When daylight came and the carts rattled on the streets, Vassiliev lay
      motionless on the sofa, staring at one point. He did not think any more of
      women, or men, or apostles. All his attention was fixed on the pain of his
      soul which tormented him. It was a dull pain, indefinite, vague; it was
      like anguish and the most acute fear and despair. He could say where the
      pain was. It was in his breast, under the heart. It could not be compared
      to anything. Once on a time he used to have violent toothache. Once, he
      had pleurisy and neuralgia. But all these pains were as nothing beside the
      pain of his soul. Beneath this pain life seemed repulsive. The thesis, his
      brilliant work already written, the people he loved, the salvation of
      fallen women, all that which only yesterday he loved or was indifferent
      to, remembered now, irritated him in the same way as the noise of the
      carts, the running about of the porters and the daylight.... If someone
      now were to perform before his eyes a deed of mercy or an act of revolting
      violence, both would produce upon him an equally repulsive impression. Of
      all the thoughts which roved lazily in his head, two only did not irritate
      him: one—at any moment he had the power to kill himself, the other—that
      the pain would not last more than three days. The second he knew from
      experience.
    

      After having lain down for a while he got up and walked wringing his
      hands, not from corner to corner as usually, but in a square along the
      walls. He caught a glimpse of himself in the glass. His face was pale and
      haggard, his temples hollow, his eyes bigger, darker, more immobile, as if
      they were not his own, and they expressed the intolerable suffering of his
      soul.
    

      In the afternoon the painter knocked at the door.
    

      "Gregory, are you at home?" he asked.
    

      Receiving no answer, he stood musing for a while, and said to himself
      good-naturedly:
    

      "Out. He's gone to the University. Damn him."
    

      And went away.
    

      Vassiliev lay down on his bed and burying his head in the pillow he began
      to cry with the pain. But the faster his tears flowed, the more terrible
      was the pain. When it was dark, he got into his mind the idea of the
      horrible night which was awaiting him and awful despair seized him. He
      dressed quickly, ran out of his room, leaving the door wide open, and into
      the street without reason or purpose. Without asking himself where he was
      going, he walked quickly to Sadovaia Street.
    

      Snow was falling as yesterday. It was thawing. Putting his hands into his
      sleeves, shivering, and frightened of the noises and the bells of the
      trams and of passers-by, Vassiliev walked from Sadovaia to Sukhariev Tower
      then to the Red Gates, and from here he turned and went to Basmannaia. He
      went into a public-house and gulped down a big glass of vodka, but felt no
      better. Arriving at Razgoulyai, he turned to the right and began to stride
      down streets that he had never in his life been down before. He came to
      that old bridge under which the river Yaouza roars and from whence long
      rows of lights are seen in the windows of the Red Barracks. In order to
      distract the pain of his soul by a new sensation or another pain, not
      knowing what to do, weeping and trembling, Vassiliev unbuttoned his coat
      and jacket, baring his naked breast to the damp snow and the wind. Neither
      lessened the pain. Then he bent over the rail of the bridge and stared
      down at the black, turbulent Yaouza, and he suddenly wanted to throw
      himself head-first, not from hatred of life, not for the sake of suicide,
      but only to hurt himself and so to kill one pain by another. But the black
      water, the dark, deserted banks covered with snow were frightening. He
      shuddered and went on. He walked as far as the Red Barracks, then back and
      into a wood, from the wood to the bridge again.
    

      "No! Home, home," he thought. "At home I believe it's easier."
    

      And he went back. On returning home he tore off his wet clothes and hat,
      began to pace along the walls, and paced incessantly until the very
      morning.
    


      VII
    

      The next morning when the painter and the medico came to see him, they
      found him in a shirt torn to ribbons, his hands bitten all over, tossing
      about in the room and moaning with pain.
    

      "For God's sake!" he began to sob, seeing his comrades, "Take me anywhere
      you like, do what you like, but save me, for God's sake now, now! I'll
      kill myself."
    

      The painter went pale and was bewildered. The medico, too, nearly began to
      cry; but, believing that medical men must be cool and serious on every
      occasion of life, he said coldly:
    

      "It's a fit you've got. But never mind. Come to the doctor, at once."
    

      "Anywhere you like, but quickly, for God's sake!"
    

      "Don't be agitated. You must struggle with yourself."
    

      The painter and the medico dressed Vassiliev with trembling hands and led
      him into the street.
    

      "Mikhail Sergueyich has been wanting to make your acquaintance for a long
      while," the medico said on the way. "He's a very nice man, and knows his
      job splendidly. He took his degree in '82, and has got a huge practice
      already. He keeps friends with the students."
    

      "Quicker, quicker...." urged Vassiliev. Mikhail Sergueyich, a stout doctor
      with fair hair, received the friends politely, firmly, coldly, and smiled
      with one cheek only.
    

      "The painter and Mayer have told me of your disease already," he said.
      "Very glad to be of service to you. Well? Sit down, please."
    

      He made Vassiliev sit down in a big chair by the table, and put a box of
      cigarettes in front of him.
    

      "Well?" he began, stroking his knees. "Let's make a start. How old are
      you?"
    

      He put questions and the medico answered. He asked whether Vassiliev's
      father suffered from any peculiar diseases, if he had fits of drinking,
      was he distinguished by his severity or any other eccentricities. He asked
      the same questions about his grandfather, mother, sisters, and brothers.
      Having ascertained that his mother had a fine voice and occasionally
      appeared on the stage, he suddenly brightened up and asked:
    

      "Excuse me, but could you recall whether the theatre was not a passion
      with your mother?"
    

      About twenty minutes passed. Vassiliev was bored by the doctor stroking
      his knees and talking of the same thing all the while.
    

      "As far as I can understand your questions, Doctor," he said. "You want to
      know whether my disease is hereditary or not. It is not hereditary."
    

      The doctor went on to ask if Vassiliev had not any secret vices in his
      early youth, any blows on the head, any love passions, eccentricities, or
      exceptional infatuations. To half the questions habitually asked by
      careful doctors you may return no answer without any injury to your
      health; but Mikhail Sergueyich, the medico and the painter looked as
      though, if Vassiliev failed to answer even one single question, everything
      would be ruined. For some reason the doctor wrote down the answers he
      received on a scrap of paper. Discovering that Vassiliev had already
      passed through the faculty of natural science and was now in the Law
      faculty, the doctor began to be pensive....
    

      "He wrote a brilliant thesis last year...." said the medico.
    

      "Excuse me. You mustn't interrupt me; you prevent me from concentrating,"
      the doctor said, smiling with one cheek. "Yes, certainly that is important
      for the anamnesis.... Yes, yes.... And do you drink vodka?" he turned to
      Vassiliev.
    

      "Very rarely."
    

      Another twenty minutes passed. The medico began sotto voce to give
      his opinion of the immediate causes of the fit and told how he, the
      painter and Vassiliev went to S——v Street the day before
      yesterday.
    

      The indifferent, reserved, cold tone in which his friends and the doctor
      were speaking of the women and the miserable street seemed to him in the
      highest degree strange....
    

      "Doctor, tell me this one thing," he said, restraining himself from being
      rude. "Is prostitution an evil or not?"
    

      "My dear fellow, who disputes it?" the doctor said with an expression as
      though he had long ago solved all these questions for himself. "Who
      disputes it?"
    

      "Are you a psychiatrist?"
    

      "Yes-s, a psychiatrist."
    

      "Perhaps all of you are right," said Vassiliev, rising and beginning to
      walk from corner to corner. "It may be. But to me all this seems amazing.
      They see a great achievement in my having passed through two faculties at
      the university; they praise me to the skies because I have written a work
      that will be thrown away and forgotten in three years' time, but became I
      can't speak of prostitutes as indifferently as I can about these chairs,
      they send me to doctors, call me a lunatic, and pity me."
    

      For some reason Vassiliev suddenly began to feel an intolerable pity for
      himself, his friends, and everybody whom he had seen the day before
      yesterday, and for the doctor. He began to sob and fell into the chair.
    

      The friends looked interrogatively at the doctor. He, looking as though he
      magnificently understood the tears and the despair, and knew himself a
      specialist in this line, approached Vassiliev and gave him some drops to
      drink, and then when Vassiliev grew calm undressed him and began to
      examine the sensitiveness of his skin, of the knee reflexes....
    

      And Vassiliev felt better. When he was coming out of the doctor's he was
      already ashamed; the noise of the traffic did not seem irritating, and the
      heaviness beneath his heart became easier and easier as though it were
      thawing. In his hand were two prescriptions. One was for kali-bromatum,
      the other—morphia. He used to take both before.
    

      He stood still in the street for a while, pensive, and then, taking leave
      of his friends, lazily dragged on towards the university.
    





      Sophia Pietrovna, the wife of the solicitor Loubianzev, a handsome young
      woman of about twenty-five, was walking quickly along a forest path with
      her bungalow neighbour, the barrister Ilyin. It was just after four. In
      the distance, above the path, white feathery clouds gathered; from behind
      them some bright blue pieces of cloud showed through. The clouds were
      motionless, as if caught on the tops of the tall, aged fir trees. It was
      calm and warm.
    

      In the distance the path was cut across by a low railway embankment, along
      which at this hour, for some reason or other, a sentry strode. Just behind
      the embankment a big, six-towered church with a rusty roof shone white.
    

      "I did not expect to meet you here," Sophia Pietrovna was saying, looking
      down and touching the last year's leaves with the end of her parasol. "But
      now I am glad to have met you. I want to speak to you seriously and
      finally. Ivan Mikhailovich, if you really love and respect me I implore
      you to stop pursuing me i You follow me like a shadow—there's such a
      wicked look in your eye—you make love to me—write
      extraordinary letters and ... I don't know how all this is going to end—Good
      Heavens! What can all this lead to?"
    

      Ilyin was silent. Sophia Pietrovna took a few steps and continued:
    

      "And this sudden complete change has happened in two or three weeks after
      five years of friendship. I do not know you any more, Ivan Mikhailovich."
    

      Sophia Pietrovna glanced sideways at her companion. He was staring
      intently, screwing up his eyes at the feathery clouds. The expression of
      his face was angry, capricious and distracted, like that of a man who
      suffers and at the same time must listen to nonsense.
    

      "It is annoying that you yourself can't realise it!" Madame Loubianzev
      continued, shrugging her shoulders. "Please understand that you're not
      playing a very nice game. I am married, I love and respect my husband. I
      have a daughter. Don't you really care in the slightest for all this?
      Besides, as an old friend, you know my views on family life ... on the
      sanctity of the home, generally."
    

      Ilyin gave an angry grunt and sighed:
    

      "The sanctity of the home," he murmured, "Good Lord!"
    

      "Yes, yes. I love and respect my husband and at any rate the peace of my
      family life is precious to me. I'd sooner let myself be killed than be the
      cause of Andrey's or his daughter's unhappiness. So, please, Ivan
      Mikhailovich, for goodness' sake, leave me alone. Let us be good and dear
      friends, and give up these sighings and gaspings which don't suit you.
      It's settled and done with! Not another word about it. Let us talk of
      something else!"
    

      Sophia Pietrovna again glanced sideways at Ilyin. He was looking up. He
      was pale, and angrily he bit his trembling lips. Madame Loubianzev could
      not understand why he was disturbed and angry, but his pallor moved her.
    

      "Don't be cross. Let's be friends," she said, sweetly.
    

      "Agreed! Here is my hand."
    

      Ilyin took her tiny plump hand in both his, pressed it and slowly raised
      it to his lips.
    

      "I'm not a schoolboy," he murmured. "I'm not in the least attracted by the
      idea of friendship with the woman I love."
    

      "That's enough. Stop! It is all settled and done with. We have come as far
      as the bench. Let us sit down...."
    

      A sweet sense of repose filled Sophia Pietrovna's soul. The most difficult
      and delicate thing was already said. The tormenting question was settled
      and done with. Now she could breathe easily and look straight at Ilyin.
      She looked at him, and the egotistical sense of superiority that a woman
      feels over her lover caressed her pleasantly. She liked the way this big
      strong man with a virile angry face and a huge black beard sat obediently
      at her side and hung his head. They were silent for a little while.
      "Nothing is yet settled and done with," Ilyin began. "You are reading me a
      sermon. 'I love and respect my husband ... the sanctity of the home....' I
      know all that for myself and I can tell you more. Honestly and sincerely I
      confess that I consider my conduct as criminal and immoral. What else? But
      why say what is known already? Instead of sermonizing you had far better
      tell me what I am to do."
    

      "I have already told you. Go away."
    

      "I have gone. You know quite well. I have started five times and half-way
      there I have come back again. I can show you the through tickets. I have
      kept them all safe. But I haven't the power to run away from you. I
      struggle frightfully, but what in Heaven's name is the use? If I cannot
      harden myself, if I'm weak and faint-hearted. I can't fight nature. Do you
      understand? I cannot! I run away from her and she holds me back by my
      coattails. Vile, vulgar weakness."
    

      Ilyin blushed, got up, and began walking by the bench:
    

      "How I hate and despise myself. Good Lord, I'm like a vicious boy—running
      after another man's wife, writing idiotic letters, degrading myself. Ach!"
      He clutched his head, grunted and sit down.
    

      "And now comes your lack of sincerity into the bargain," he continued with
      bitterness. "If you don't think I am playing a nice game—why are you
      here? What drew you? In my letters I only ask you for a straightforward
      answer: Yes, or No; and instead of giving it me, every day you contrive
      that we shall meet 'by chance' and you treat me to quotations from a moral
      copy-book."
    

      Madame Loubianzev reddened and got frightened. She suddenly felt the kind
      of awkwardness that a modest woman would feel at being suddenly discovered
      naked.
    

      "You seem to suspect some deceit on my side," she murmured. "I have always
      given you a straight answer; and I asked you for one to-day."
    

      "Ah, does one ask such things? If you had said to me at once 'Go away,' I
      would have gone long ago, but you never told me to. Never once have you
      been frank. Strange irresolution. My God, either you're playing with me,
      or...."
    

      Ilyin did not finish, and rested his head in his hands. Sophia Pietrovna
      recalled her behaviour all through. She remembered that she had felt all
      these days not only in deed but even in her most intimate thoughts opposed
      to Ilyin's love. But at the same moment she knew that there was a grain of
      truth in the barrister's words. And not knowing what kind of truth it was
      she could not think, no matter how much she thought about it, what to say
      to him in answer to his complaint. It was awkward being silent, so she
      said shrugging her shoulders:
    

      "So I'm to blame for that too?"
    

      "I don't blame you for your insincerity," sighed Ilyin. "It slipped out
      unconsciously. Your insincerity is natural to you, in the natural order of
      things as well. If all mankind were to agree suddenly to become serious,
      everything would go to the Devil, to ruin."
    

      Sophia Pietrovna was not in the mood for philosophy; but she was glad of
      the opportunity to change the conversation and asked:
    

      "Why indeed?"
    

      "Because only savages and animals are sincere. Since civilisation
      introduced into society the demand, for instance, for such a luxury as
      woman's virtue, sincerity has been out of place."
    

      Angrily Ilyin began to thrust his stick into the sand. Madame Loubianzev
      listened without understanding much of it; she liked the conversation.
      First of all, she was pleased that a gifted man should speak to her, an
      average woman, about intellectual things; also it gave her great pleasure
      to watch how the pale, lively, still angry, young face was working. Much
      she did not understand; but the fine courage of modern man was revealed to
      her, the courage by which he without reflection or surmise solves the
      great questions and constructs his simple conclusions.
    

      Suddenly she discovered that she was admiring him, and it frightened her.
    

      "Pardon, but I don't really understand," she hastened to say. "Why did you
      mention insincerity? I entreat you once more, be a dear, good friend and
      leave me alone. Sincerely, I ask it."
    

      "Good—I'll do my best. But hardly anything will come of it. Either
      I'll put a bullet through my brains or ... I'll start drinking in the
      stupidest possible way. Things will end badly for me. Everything has its
      limit, even a struggle with nature. Tell me now, how can one struggle with
      madness? If you've drunk wine, how can you get over the excitement? What
      can I do if your image has grown into my soul, and stands incessantly
      before my eyes, night and day, as plain as that fir tree there? Tell me
      then what thing I must do to get out of this wretched, unhappy state, when
      all my thoughts, desires, and dreams belong, not to me, but to some devil
      that has got hold of me? I love you, I love you so much that I've turned
      away from my path, given up my career and my closest friends, forgot my
      God. Never in my life have I loved so much."
    

      Sophia Pietrovna, who was not expecting this turn, drew her body away from
      Ilyin, and glanced at him frightened. Tears shone in his eyes. His lips
      trembled, and a hungry, suppliant expression showed over all his face.
    

      "I love you," he murmured, bringing his own eyes near to her big,
      frightened ones. "You are so beautiful. I'm suffering now; but I swear I
      could remain so all my life, suffering and looking into your eyes, but....
      Keep silent, I implore you."
    

      Sophia Pietrovna as if taken unawares began, quickly, quickly, to think
      out words with which to stop him. "I shall go away," she decided, but no
      sooner had she moved to get up, than Ilyin was on his knees at her feet
      already. He embraced her knees, looked into her eyes and spoke
      passionately, ardently, beautifully. She did not hear his words, for her
      fear and agitation. Somehow now at this dangerous moment when her knees
      pleasantly contracted, as in a warm bath, she sought with evil intention
      to read some meaning into her sensation. She was angry because the whole
      of her instead of protesting virtue was filled with weakness, laziness,
      and emptiness, like a drunken man to whom the ocean is but knee-deep; only
      in the depths of her soul, a little remote malignant voice teased: "Why
      don't you go away? Then this is right, is it?"
    

      Seeking in herself an explanation she could not understand why she had not
      withdrawn the hand to which Ilyin's lips clung like a leech, nor why, at
      the same time as Ilyin, she looked hurriedly right and left to see that
      they were not observed.
    

      The fir-trees and the clouds stood motionless, and gazed at them severely
      like broken-down masters who see something going on, but have been bribed
      not to report to the head. The sentry on the embankment stood like a stick
      and seemed to be staring at the bench. "Let him look!" thought Sophia
      Pietrovna.
    

      "But ... But listen," she said at last with despair in her voice. "What
      will this lead to? What will happen afterwards?"
    

      "I don't know. I don't know," he began to whisper, waving these unpleasant
      questions aside.
    

      The hoarse, jarring whistle of a railway engine became audible. This cold,
      prosaic sound of the everyday world made Madame Loubianzev start.
    

      "It's time, I must go," she said, getting up quickly. "The train is
      coming. Audrey is arriving. He will want his dinner."
    

      Sophia Pietrovna turned her blazing cheeks to the embankment. First the
      engine came slowly into sight, after it the carriages. It was not a
      bungalow train, but a goods train. In a long row, one after another like
      the days of man's life, the cars drew past the white background of the
      church, and there seemed to be no end to them.
    

      But at last the train disappeared, and the end car with the guard and the
      lighted lamps disappeared into the green. Sophia Pietrovna turned sharply
      and not looking at Ilyin began to walk quickly back along the path. She
      had herself in control again. Red with shame, offended, not by Ilyin, no I
      but by the cowardice and shamelessness with which she, a good, respectable
      woman allowed a stranger to embrace her knees. She had only one thought
      now, to reach her bungalow and her family as quickly as possible. The
      barrister could hardly keep up with her. Turning from the path on to a
      little track, she glanced at him so quickly that she noticed only the sand
      on his knees, and she motioned with her hand at him to let her be.
    

      Running into the house Sophia Pietrovna stood for about five minutes
      motionless in her room, looking now at the window then at the writing
      table.... "You disgraceful woman," she scolded herself; "disgraceful!" In
      spite of herself she recollected every detail, hiding nothing, how all
      these days she had been against Ilyin's love-making, yet she was somehow
      drawn to meet him and explain; but besides this when he was lying at her
      feet she felt an extraordinary pleasure. She recalled everything, not
      sparing herself, and now, stifled with shame, she could have slapped her
      own face.
    

      "Poor Andrey," she thought, trying, as she remembered her husband, to give
      her face the tenderest possible expression—"Varya, my poor darling
      child, does not know what a mother she has. Forgive me, my dears. I love
      you very much ... very much!..."
    

      And wishing to convince herself that she was still a good wife and mother,
      that corruption had not yet touched those "sanctities" of hers, of which
      she had spoken to Ilyin, Sophia Pietrovna ran into the kitchen and scolded
      the cook for not having laid the table for Andrey Ilyitch. She tried to
      imagine her husband's tired, hungry look, and pitying him aloud, she laid
      the table herself, a thing which she had never done before. Then she found
      her daughter Varya, lifted her up in her hands and kissed her
      passionately; the child seemed to her heavy and cold, but she would not
      own it to herself, and she began to tell her what a good, dear, splendid
      father she had.
    

      But when, soon after, Andrey. Ilyitch arrived, she barely greeted him. The
      flow of imaginary feelings had ebbed away without convincing her of
      anything; she was only exasperated and enraged by the lie. She sat at the
      window, suffered, and raged. Only in distress can people understand how
      difficult it is to master their thoughts and feelings. Sophia Pietrovna
      said afterwards a confusion was going on inside her as hard to define as
      to count a cloud of swiftly flying sparrows. Thus from the fact that she
      was delighted at her husband's arrival and pleased with the way he behaved
      at dinner, she suddenly concluded that she had begun to hate him. Andrey
      Ilyitch, languid with hunger and fatigue, while waiting for the soup, fell
      upon the sausage and ate it greedily, chewing loudly and moving his
      temples.
    

      "My God," thought Sophia Pietrovna. "I do love and respect him, but ...
      why does he chew so disgustingly."
    

      Her thoughts were no less disturbed than her feelings. Madame Loubianzev,
      like all who have no experience of the struggle with unpleasant thought,
      did her best not to think of her unhappiness, and the more zealously she
      tried, the more vivid Ilyin became to her imagination, the sand on his
      knees, the feathery clouds, the train....
    

      "Why did I—idiot—go to-day?" she teased herself. "And am I
      really a person who can't answer for herself?"
    

      Fear has big eyes. When Andrey Ilyitch had finished the last course, she
      had already resolved to tell him everything and so escape from danger.
    

      "Andrey, I want to speak to you seriously," she began after dinner, when
      her husband was taking off his coat and boots in order to have a lie down.
    

      "Well?"
    

      "Let's go away from here!"
    

      "How—where to? It's still too early to go to town."
    

      "No. Travel or something like that."
    

      "Travel," murmured the solicitor, stretching himself. "I dream of it
      myself, but where shall I get the money, and who'll look after my
      business."
    

      After a little reflection he added:
    

      "Yes, really you are bored. Go by yourself if you want to."
    

      Sophia Pietrovna agreed; but at the same time she saw that Ilyin would be
      glad of the opportunity to travel in the same train with her, in the same
      carriage....
    

      She pondered and looked at her husband, who was full fed but still
      languid. For some reason her eyes stopped on his feet, tiny, almost
      womanish, in stupid socks. On the toe of both socks little threads were
      standing out. Under the drawn blind a bumble bee was knocking against the
      window pane and buzzing. Sophia Pietrovna stared at the threads, listened
      to the bumble bee and pictured her journey.... Day and night Ilyin sits
      opposite, without taking his eyes from her, angry with his weakness and
      pale with the pain of his soul. He brands himself as a libertine, accuses
      her, tears his hair; but when the dark comes he seizes the chance when the
      passengers go to sleep or alight at a station and falls on his knees
      before her and clasps her feet, as he did by the bench....
    

      She realised that she was dreaming....
    

      "Listen. I am not going by myself," she said. "You must come, too!"
    

      "Sophochka, that's all imagination!" sighed Loubianzev. "You must be
      serious and only ask for the possible...."
    

      "You'll come when you And out!" thought Sophia Pietrovna.
    

      Having decided to go away at all costs, she began to feel free from
      danger; her thoughts fell gradually into order, she became cheerful and
      even allowed herself to think about everything. Whatever she may think or
      dream about, she is going all the same. While her husband still slept,
      little by little, evening came....
    

      She sat in the drawing-room playing the piano. Outside the window the
      evening animation, the sound of music, but chiefly the thought of her own
      cleverness in mastering her misery gave the final touch to her joy. Other
      women, her easy conscience told her, in a position like her own would
      surely not resist, they would spin round like a whirlwind; but she was
      nearly burnt up with shame, she suffered and now she had escaped from a
      danger which perhaps was nonexistent! Her virtue and resolution moved her
      so much that she even glanced at herself in the glass three times.
    

      When it was dark visitors came. The men sat down to cards in the
      dining-room, the ladies were in the drawing room and on the terrace. Ilyin
      came last, he was stem and gloomy and looked ill. He sat down on a corner
      of the sofa and did not get up for the whole evening. Usually cheerful and
      full of conversation, he was now silent, frowning, and rubbing his eyes.
      When he had to answer a question he smiled with difficulty and only with
      his upper lip, answering abruptly and spitefully. He made about five jokes
      in all, but his jokes seemed crude and insolent. It seemed to Sophia
      Pietrovna that he was on the brink of hysteria. But only now as she sat at
      the piano did she acknowledge that the unhappy man was not in the mood to
      joke, that he was sick in his soul, he could find no place for himself. It
      was for her sake he was ruining the best days of his career and his youth,
      wasting his last farthing on a bungalow, had left his mother and sisters
      uncared for, and, above all, was breaking down under the martyrdom of his
      struggle. From simple, common humanity she ought to take him seriously....
    

      All this was dear to her, even to paining her. If she were to go up to
      Ilyin now and say to him "No," there would be such strength in her voice
      that it would be hard to disobey. But she did not go up to him and she did
      not say it, did not even think it.... The petty selfishness of a young
      nature seemed never to have been revealed in her as strongly as that
      evening. She admitted that Byin was unhappy and that he sat on the sofa as
      if on hot coals. She was sorry for him, but at the same time the presence
      of the man who loved her so desperately filled her with a triumphant sense
      of her own power. She felt her youth, her beauty, her inaccessibility, and—since
      she had decided to go away—she gave herself full rein this evening.
      She coquetted, laughed continually, she sang with singular emotion, and as
      one inspired. Everything made her gay and everything seemed funny. It
      amused her to recall the incident of the bench, the sentry looking on. The
      visitors seemed funny to her, Ilyin's insolent jokes, his tie pin which
      she had never seen before. The pin was a little red snake with tiny
      diamond eyes; the snake seemed so funny that she was ready to kiss and
      kiss it.
    

      Sophia Pietrovna, nervously sang romantic songs, with a kind of
      half-intoxication, and as if jeering at another's sorrow she chose sad,
      melancholy songs that spoke of lost hopes, of the past, of old age....
      "And old age is approaching nearer and nearer," she sang. What had she to
      do with old age?
    

      "There's something wrong going on in me," she thought now and then through
      laughter and singing.
    

      At twelve o'clock the visitors departed. Ilyin was the last to go. She
      still felt warm enough about him to go with him to the lower step of the
      terrace. She had the idea of telling him that she was going away with her
      husband, just to see what effect this news would have upon him.
    

      The moon was hiding behind the clouds, but it was so bright that Sophia
      Pietrovna could see the wind playing with the tails of his overcoat and
      with the creepers on the terrace. It was also plain how pale Ilyin was,
      and how he twisted his upper-lip, trying to smile. "Sonia, Sonichka, my
      dear little woman," he murmured, not letting her speak. "My darling, my
      pretty one."
    

      In a paroxysm of tenderness with tears in his voice, he showered her with
      endearing words each tenderer than the other, and was already speaking to
      her as if she were his wife or his mistress. Suddenly and unexpectedly to
      her, he put one arm round her and with the other hand he seized her elbow.
    

      "My dear one, my beauty," he began to whisper, kissing the nape of her
      neck; "be sincere, come to me now."
    

      She slipped out of his embrace and lifted her head to break out in
      indignation and revolt. But indignation did not come, and of all her
      praiseworthy virtue and purity, there was left only enough for her to say
      that which all average women say in similar circumstances:
    

      "You must be mad."
    

      "But really let us go," continued Ilyin. "Just now and over there by the
      bench I felt convinced that you, Sonia, were as helpless as myself. You
      too will be all the worse for it. You love me, and you are making a
      useless bargain with your conscience."
    

      Seeing that she was leaving him he seized her by her lace sleeve and ended
      quickly:
    

      "If not to-day, then to-morrow; but you will have to give in. What's the
      good of putting if off? My dear, my darling Sonia, the verdict has been
      pronounced. Why postpone the execution? Why deceive yourself?"
    

      Sophia Pietrovna broke away from him and suddenly disappeared inside the
      door. She returned to the drawing-room, shut the piano mechanically,
      stared for a long time at the cover of a music book, and sat down. She
      could neither stand nor think.... From her agitation and passion remained
      only an awful weakness mingled with laziness and tiredness. Her conscience
      whispered to her that she had behaved wickedly and foolishly to-night,
      like a madwoman; that just now she had been kissed on the terrace, and
      even now she had some strange sensation in her waist and in her elbow. Not
      a soul was in the drawing-room. Only a single candle was burning. Madame
      Loubianzev sat on a little round stool before the piano without stirring
      as if waiting for something, and as if taking advantage of her extreme
      exhaustion and the dark a heavy unconquerable desire began to possess her.
      Like a boa-constrictor, it enchained her limbs and soul. It grew every
      second and was no longer threatening, but stood clear before her in all
      its nakedness.
    

      She sat thus for half an hour, not moving, and not stopping herself from
      thinking of Ilyin. Then she got up lazily and went slowly into the
      bed-room. Andrey Ilyitch was in bed already. She sat by the window and
      gave herself to her desire. She felt no more "confusion." All her feelings
      and thoughts pressed lovingly round some clear purpose. She still had a
      mind to struggle, but instantly she waved her hand impotently, realising
      the strength and the determination of the foe. To fight him power and
      strength were necessary, but her birth, up-bringing and life had given her
      nothing on which to lean.
    

      "You're immoral, you're horrible," she tormented herself for her weakness.
      "You're a nice sort, you are!"
    

      So indignant was her insulted modesty at this weakness that she called
      herself all the bad names that she knew and she related to herself many
      insulting, degrading truths. Thus she told herself that she never was
      moral, and she had not fallen before only because there was no pretext,
      that her day-long struggle had been nothing but a game and a comedy....
    

      "Let us admit that I struggled," she thought, "but what kind of a fight
      was it? Even prostitutes struggle before they sell themselves, and still
      they do sell themselves. It's a pretty sort of fight. Like milk, turns in
      a day." She realised that it was not love that drew her from her home nor
      Ilyin's personality, but the sensations which await her.... A little
      week-end type like the rest of them.
    

      "When the young bird's mother was killed," a hoarse tenor finished
      singing.
    

      If I am going, it's time, thought Sophia Pietrovna. Her heart began to
      beat with a frightful force.
    

      "Andrey," she almost cried. "Listen. Shall we go away? Shall we? Yes?"
    

      "Yes.... I've told you already. You go alone."
    

      "But listen," she said, "if you don't come too, you may lose me. I seem to
      be in love already."
    

      "Who with?" Andrey Ilyitch asked.
    

      "It must be all the same for you, who with," Sophia Pietrovna cried out.
    

      Andrey Ilyitch got up, dangled his feet over the side of the bed, with a
      look of surprise at the dark form of his wife.
    

      "Imagination," he yawned.
    

      He could not believe her, but all the same he was frightened. After having
      thought for a while, and asked his wife some unimportant questions, he
      gave his views of the family, of infidelity.... He spoke sleepily for
      about ten minutes and then lay down again. His remarks had no success.
      There are a great many opinions in this world, and more than half of them
      belong to people who have never known misery.
    

      In spite of the late hour, the bungalow people were still moving behind
      their windows. Sophia Pietrovna put on a long coat and stood for a while,
      thinking. She still had force of mind to say to her sleepy husband:
    

      "Are you asleep? I'm going for a little walk. Would you like to come with
      me?"
    

      That was her last hope. Receiving no answer, she walked out. It was breezy
      and cool. She did not feel the breeze or the darkness but walked on and
      on.... An irresistible power drove her, and it seemed to her that if she
      stopped that power would push her in the back. "You're an immoral woman,"
      she murmured mechanically. "You're horrible."
    

      She was choking for breath, burning with shame, did not feel her feet
      under her, for that which drove her along was stronger than her shame, her
      reason, her fear....
    





      Nadya Zelenina had just returned with her mother from the theatre, where
      they had been to see a performance of "Eugene Oniegin." Entering her room,
      she quickly threw off her dress, loosened her hair, and sat down hurriedly
      in her petticoat and a white blouse to write a letter in the style of
      Tatiana.
    

      "I love you,"—she wrote—"but you don't love me; no, you
      don't!"
    

      The moment she had written this, she smiled.
    

      She was only sixteen years old, and so far she had not been in love. She
      knew that Gorny, the officer, and Gronsdiev, the student, loved her; but
      now, after the theatre, she wanted to doubt their love. To be unloved and
      unhappy—how interesting. There is something beautiful, affecting,
      romantic in the fact that one loves deeply while the other is indifferent.
      Oniegin is interesting because he does not love at all, and Tatiana is
      delightful because she is very much in love; but if they loved each other
      equally and were happy, they would seem boring, instead.
    

      "Don't go on protesting that you love me," Nadya wrote on, thinking of
      Gorny, the officer, "I can't believe you. You're very clever, educated,
      serious; you have a great talent, and perhaps, a splendid future waiting,
      but I am an uninteresting poor-spirited girl, and you yourself know quite
      well that I shall only be a drag upon your life. It's true I carried you
      off your feet, and you thought you had met your ideal in me, but that was
      a mistake. Already you are asking yourself in despair, 'Why did I meet
      this girl?' Only your kindness prevents you from confessing it."
    

      Nadya pitied herself. She wept and went on.
    

      "If it were not so difficult for me to leave mother and brother I would
      put on a nun's gown and go where my eyes direct me. You would then be free
      to love another. If I were to die!"
    

      Through her tears she could not make out what she had written. Brief
      rainbows trembled on the table, on the floor and the ceiling, as though
      Nadya were looking through a prism. Impossible to write. She sank back in
      her chair and began to think of Gorny.
    

      Oh, how fascinating, how interesting men are! Nadya remembered the
      beautiful expression of Gorny's face, appealing, guilty, and tender, when
      someone discussed music with him,—the efforts he made to prevent the
      passion from sounding in his voice. Passion must be concealed in a society
      where cold reserve and indifference are the signs of good breeding. And he
      does try to conceal it, but he does not succeed, and everybody knows quite
      well that he has a passion for music. Never-ending discussions about
      music, blundering pronouncements by men who do not understand—keep
      him in incessant tension. He is scared, timid, silent. He plays superbly,
      as an ardent pianist. If he were not an officer, he would be a famous
      musician.
    

      The tears dried in her eyes. Nadya remembered how Gorny told her of his
      love at a symphony concert, and again downstairs by the cloak-room.
    

      "I am so glad you have at last made the acquaintance of the student
      Gronsdiev," she continued to write. "He is a very clever man, and you are
      sure to love him. Yesterday he was sitting with us till two o'clock in the
      morning. We were all so happy. I was sorry that you hadn't come to us. He
      said a lot of remarkable things."
    

      Nadya laid her hands on the table and lowered her head. Her hair covered
      the letter. She remembered that Gronsdiev also loved her, and that he had
      the same right to her letter as Gorny. Perhaps she had better write to
      Gronsdiev? For no cause, a happiness began to quicken in her breast. At
      first it was a little one, rolling about in her breast like a rubber ball.
      Then it grew broader and bigger, and broke forth like a wave. Nadya had
      already forgotten about Gorny and Gronsdiev. Her thoughts became confused.
      The happiness grew more and more. From her breast it ran into her arms and
      legs, and it seemed that a light fresh breeze blew over her head, stirring
      her hair. Her shoulders trembled with quiet laughter. The table and the
      lampglass trembled. Tears from her eyes splashed the letter. She was
      powerless to stop her laughter; and to convince herself that she had a
      reason for it, she hastened to remember something funny.
    

      "What a funny poodle!" she cried, feeling that she was choking with
      laughter. "What a funny poodle!"
    

      She remembered how Gronsdiev was playing with Maxim the poodle after tea
      yesterday; how he told a story afterwards of a very clever poodle who was
      chasing a crow in the yard. The crow gave him a look and said:
    

      "Oh, you swindler!"
    

      The poodle did not know he had to do with a learned crow. He was terribly
      confused, and ran away dumfounded. Afterwards he began to bark.
    

      "No, I'd better love Gronsdiev," Nadya decided and tore up the letter.
    

      She began to think of the student, of his love, of her own love, with the
      result that the thoughts in her head swam apart and she thought about
      everything, about her mother, the street, the pencil, the piano. She was
      happy thinking, and found that everything was good, magnificent. Her
      happiness told her that this was not all, that a little later it would be
      still better. Soon it will be spring, summer. They will go with mother to
      Gorbiki in the country. Gorny will come for his holidays. He will walk in
      the orchard with her, and make love to her. Gronsdiev will come too. He
      will play croquet with her and bowls. He will tell funny, wonderful
      stories. She passionately longed for the orchard, the darkness, the pure
      sky, the stars. Again her shoulders trembled with laughter and she seemed
      to awake to a smell of wormwood in the room; and a branch was tapping at
      the window.
    

      She went to her bed and sat down. She did not know what to do with her
      great happiness. It overwhelmed her. She stared at the crucifix which hung
      at the head of her bed and saying:
    

      "Dear God, dear God, dear God."
    





      Ivan Ivanich Lapkin, a pleasant looking young man, and Anna Zamblizky, a
      young girl with a little snub nose, walked down the sloping bank and sat
      down on the bench. The bench was close to the water's edge, among thick
      bushes of young willow. A heavenly spot! You sat down, and you were hidden
      from the world. Only the fish could see you and the catspaws which flashed
      over the water like lightning. The two young persons were equipped with
      rods, fish hooks, bags, tins of worms and everything else necessary. Once
      seated, they immediately began to fish.
    

      "I am glad that we're left alone at last," said Lapkin, looking round.
      I've got a lot to tell you, Anna—tremendous ... when I saw you for
      the first time ... you've got a nibble ... I understood then—why I
      am alive, I knew where my idol was, to whom I can devote my honest,
      hardworking life.... It must be a big one ... it is biting.... When I saw
      you—for the first time in my life I fell in love—fell in love
      passionately I Don't pull. Let it go on biting.... Tell me, darling, tell
      me—will you let me hope? No! I'm not worth it. I dare not even think
      of it—may I hope for.... Pull!
    

      Anna lifted her hand that held the rod—pulled, cried out. A silvery
      green fish shone in the air.
    

      "Goodness! it's a perch! Help—quick! It's slipping off." The perch
      tore itself from the hook—danced in the grass towards its native
      element and ... leaped into the water.
    

      But instead of the little fish that he was chasing, Lapkin quite by
      accident caught hold of Anna's hand—quite by accident pressed it to
      his lips. She drew back, but it was too late; quite by accident their lips
      met and kissed; yes, it was an absolute accident! They kissed and kissed.
      Then came vows and assurances.... Blissful moments! But there is no such
      thing as absolute happiness in this life. If happiness itself does not
      contain a poison, poison will enter in from without. Which happened this
      time. Suddenly, while the two were kissing, a laugh was heard. They looked
      at the river and were paralysed. The schoolboy Kolia, Anna's brother, was
      standing in the water, watching the young people and maliciously laughing.
    

      "Ah—ha! Kissing!" said he. "Right O, I'll tell Mother."
    

      "I hope that you—as a man of honour," Lapkin muttered, blushing.
      "It's disgusting to spy on us, it's loathsome to tell tales, it's rotten.
      As a man of honour...."
    

      "Give me a shilling, then I'll shut up!" the man of honour retorted. "If
      you don't, I'll tell."
    

      Lapkin took a shilling out of his pocket and gave it to Kolia, who
      squeezed it in his wet fist, whistled, and swam away. And the young people
      did not kiss any more just then.
    

      Next day Lapkin brought Kolia some paints and a ball from town, and his
      sister gave him all her empty pill boxes. Then they had to present him
      with a set of studs like dogs' heads. The wretched boy enjoyed this game
      immensely, and to keep it going he began to spy on them. Wherever Lapkin
      and Anna went, he was there too. He did not leave them alone for a single
      moment.
    

      "Beast!" Lapkin gnashed his teeth. "So young and yet such a full fledged
      scoundrel. What on earth will become of him later!"
    

      During the whole of July the poor lovers had no life apart from him. He
      threatened to tell on them; he dogged them and demanded more presents.
      Nothing satisfied him—finally he hinted at a gold watch. All right,
      they had to promise the watch.
    

      Once, at table, when biscuits were being handed round, he burst out
      laughing and said to Lapkin: "Shall I let on? Ah—ha!"
    

      Lapkin blushed fearfully and instead of a biscuit he began to chew his
      table napkin. Anna jumped up from the table and rushed out of the room.
    

      And this state of things went on until the end of August, up to the day
      when Lapkin at last proposed to Anna. Ah! What a happy day that was! When
      he had spoken to her parents and obtained their consent Lapkin rushed into
      the garden after Kolia. When he found him he nearly cried for joy and
      caught hold of the wretched boy by the ear. Anna, who was also looking for
      Kolia came running up and grabbed him by the other ear. You should have
      seen the happiness depicted on their faces while Kolia roared and begged
      them:
    

      "Darling, precious pets, I won't do it again. O-oh—O-oh! Forgive
      me!" And both of them confessed afterwards that during all the time they
      were in love with each other they never experienced such happiness, such
      overwhelming joy as during those moments when they pulled the wretched
      boy's ears.
    





      About ten o'clock of a dark September evening the Zemstvo doctor Kirilov's
      only son, six-year-old Andrey, died of diphtheria. As the doctor's wife
      dropped on to her knees before the dead child's cot and the first paroxysm
      of despair took hold of her, the bell rang sharply in the hall.
    

      When the diphtheria came all the servants were sent away from the house,
      that very morning. Kirilov himself went to the door, just as he was, in
      his shirt-sleeves with his waistcoat unbuttoned, without wiping his wet
      face or hands, which had been burnt with carbolic acid. It was dark in the
      hall, and of the person who entered could be distinguished only his middle
      height, a white scarf and a big, extraordinarily pale face, so pale that
      it seemed as though its appearance made the hall brighter....
    

      "Is the doctor in?" the visitor asked abruptly.
    

      "I'm at home," answered Kirilov. "What do you want?"
    

      "Oh, you're the doctor? I'm so glad!" The visitor was overjoyed and began
      to seek for the doctor's hand in the darkness. He found it and squeezed it
      hard in his own. "I'm very ... very glad! We were introduced ... I am
      Aboguin ... had the pleasure of meeting you this summer at Mr. Gnouchev's.
      I am very glad to have found you at home.... For God's sake, don't say you
      won't come with me immediately.... My wife has been taken dangerously
      ill.... I have the carriage with me...."
    

      From the visitor's voice and movements it was evident that he had been in
      a state of violent agitation. Exactly as though he had been frightened by
      a fire or a mad dog, he could hardly restrain his hurried breathing, and
      he spoke quickly in a trembling voice. In his speech there sounded a note
      of real sincerity, of childish fright. Like all men who are frightened and
      dazed, he spoke in short, abrupt phrases and uttered many superfluous,
      quite unnecessary, words.
    

      "I was afraid I shouldn't find you at home," he continued. "While I was
      coming to you I suffered terribly.... Dress yourself and let us go, for
      God's sake.... It happened like this. Papchinsky came to me—Alexander
      Siemionovich, you know him.... We were chatting.... Then we sat down to
      tea. Suddenly my wife cries out, presses her hands to her heart, and falls
      back in her chair. We carried her off to her bed and ... and I rubbed her
      forehead with sal-volatile, and splashed her with water.... She lies like
      a corpse.... I'm afraid that her heart's failed.... Let us go.... Her
      father too died of heart-failure."
    

      Kirilov listened in silence as though he did not understand the Russian
      language.
    

      When Aboguin once more mentioned Papchinsky and his wife's father, and
      once more began to seek for the doctor's hand in the darkness, the doctor
      shook his head and said, drawling each word listlessly:
    

      "Excuse me, but I can't go.... Five minutes ago my ... my son died."
    

      "Is that true?" Aboguin whispered, stepping back. "My God, what an awful
      moment to come! It's a terribly fated day ... terribly! What a coincidence
      ... and it might have been on purpose!"
    

      Aboguin took hold of the door handle and drooped his head in meditation.
      Evidently he was hesitating, not knowing whether to go away, or to ask the
      doctor once more.
    

      "Listen," he said eagerly, seizing Kirilov by the sleeve. "I fully
      understand your state! God knows I'm ashamed to try to hold your attention
      at such a moment, but what can I do? Think yourself—who can I go to?
      There isn't another doctor here besides you. For heaven's sake come. I'm
      not asking for myself. It's not I that's ill!"
    

      Silence began. Kirilov turned his back to Aboguin, stood still for a while
      and slowly went out of the hall into the drawing-room. To judge by his
      uncertain, machine-like movement, and by the attentiveness with which he
      arranged the hanging shade on the unlighted lamp in the drawing-room and
      consulted a thick book which lay on the table—at such a moment he
      had neither purpose nor desire, nor did he think of anything, and probably
      had already forgotten that there was a stranger standing in his hall. The
      gloom and the quiet of the drawing-room apparently increased his insanity.
      As he went from the drawing-room to his study he raised his right foot
      higher than he need, felt with his hands for the door-posts, and then one
      felt a certain perplexity in his whole figure, as though he had entered a
      strange house by chance, or for the first time in his life had got drunk,
      and now was giving himself up in bewilderment to the new sensation. A wide
      line of light stretched across the bookshelves on one wall of the study;
      this light, together with the heavy stifling smell of carbolic acid and
      ether came from the door ajar that led from the study into the
      bed-room.... The doctor sank into a chair before the table; for a while he
      looked drowsily at the shining books, then rose and went into the
      bed-room.
    

      Here, in the bed-room, dead quiet reigned. Everything, down to the last
      trifle, spoke eloquently of the tempest undergone, of weariness, and
      everything rested. The candle which stood among a close crowd of phials,
      boxes and jars on the stool and the big lamp on the chest of drawers
      brightly lit the room. On the bed, by the window, the boy lay open-eyed,
      with a look of wonder on his face. He did not move, but it seemed that his
      open eyes became darker and darker every second and sank into his skull.
      Having laid her hands on his body and hid her face in the folds of the
      bed-clothes, the mother now was on her knees before the bed. Like the boy
      she did not move, but how much living movement was felt in the coil of her
      body and in her hands! She was pressing close to the bed with her whole
      being, with eager vehemence, as though she were afraid to violate the
      quiet and comfortable pose which she had found at last for her weary body.
      Blankets, cloths, basins, splashes on the floor, brushes and spoons
      scattered everywhere, a white bottle of lime-water, the stifling heavy air
      itself—everything died away, and as it were plunged into quietude.
    

      The doctor stopped by his wife, thrust his hands into his trouser pockets
      and bending his head on one side looked fixedly at his son. His face
      showed indifference; only the drops which glistened on his beard revealed
      that he had been lately weeping.
    

      The repulsive terror of which we think when we speak of death was absent
      from the bed-room. In the pervading dumbness, in the mother's pose, in the
      indifference of the doctor's face was something attractive that touched
      the heart, the subtle and elusive beauty of human grief, which it will
      take men long to understand and describe, and only music, it seems, is
      able to express. Beauty too was felt in the stern stillness. Kirilov and
      his wife were silent and did not weep, as though they confessed all the
      poetry of their condition. As once the season of their youth passed away,
      so now in this boy their right to bear children had passed away, alas! for
      ever to eternity. The doctor is forty-four years old, already grey and
      looks like an old man; his faded sick wife is thirty-five. Audrey was not
      merely the only son but the last.
    

      In contrast to his wife the doctor's nature belonged to those which feel
      the necessity of movement when their soul is in pain. After standing by
      his wife for about five minutes, he passed from the bed-room, lifting his
      right foot too high, into a little room half filled with a big broad
      divan. From there he went to the kitchen. After wandering about the
      fireplace and the cook's bed, he stooped through a little door and came
      into the hall.
    

      Here he saw the white scarf and the pale face again.
    

      "At last," sighed Aboguin, seizing the doorhandle. "Let us go, please."
    

      The doctor shuddered, glanced at him and remembered.
    

      "Listen. I've told you already that I can't go," he said, livening. "What
      a strange idea!"
    

      "Doctor, I'm made of flesh and blood, too. I fully understand your
      condition. I sympathise with you," Aboguin said in an imploring voice,
      putting his hand to his scarf. "But I am not asking for myself. My wife is
      dying. If you had heard her cry, if you'd seen her face, you would
      understand my insistence! My God—and I thought that you'd gone to
      dress yourself. The time is precious, Doctor! Let us go, I beg of you."
    

      "I can't come," Kirilov said after a pause, and stepped into his
      drawing-room.
    

      Aboguin followed him and seized him by the sleeve.
    

      "You're in sorrow. I understand. But I'm not asking you to cure a
      toothache, or to give expert evidence,—but to save a human life." He
      went on imploring like a beggar. "This life is more than any personal
      grief. I ask you for courage, for a brave deed—in the name of
      humanity."
    

      "Humanity cuts both ways," Kirilov said irritably. "In the name of the
      same humanity I ask you not to take me away. My God, what a strange idea!
      I can hardly stand on my feet and you frighten me with humanity. I'm not
      fit for anything now. I won't go for anything. With whom shall I leave my
      wife? No, no...."
    

      Kirilov flung out his open hands and drew back.
    

      "And ... and don't ask me," he continued, disturbed. "I'm sorry.... Under
      the Laws, Volume XIII., I'm obliged to go and you have the right to drag
      me by the neck.... Well, drag me, but ... I'm not fit.... I'm not even
      able to speak. Excuse me."
    

      "It's quite unfair to speak to me in that tone, Doctor," said Aboguin,
      again taking the doctor by the sleeve. "The thirteenth volume be damned! I
      have no right to do violence to your will. If you want to, come; if you
      don't, then God be with you; but it's not to your will that I apply, but
      to your feelings. A young woman is dying! You say your son died just now.
      Who could understand my terror better than you?"
    

      Aboguin's voice trembled with agitation. His tremor and his tone were much
      more convincing than his words. Aboguin was sincere, but it is remarkable
      that every phrase he used came out stilted, soulless, inopportunely
      florid, and as it were insulted the atmosphere of the doctor's house and
      the woman who was dying. He felt it himself, and in his fear of being
      misunderstood he exerted himself to the utmost to make his voice soft and
      tender so as to convince by the sincerity of his tone at least, if not by
      his words. As a rule, however deep and beautiful the words they affect
      only the unconcerned. They cannot always satisfy those who are happy or
      distressed because the highest expression of happiness or distress is most
      often silence. Lovers understand each other best when they are silent, and
      a fervent passionate speech at the graveside affects only outsiders. To
      the widow and children it seems cold and trivial.
    

      Kirilov stood still and was silent. When Aboguin uttered some more words
      on the higher vocation of a doctor, and self-sacrifice, the doctor sternly
      asked:
    

      "Is it far?"
    

      "Thirteen or fourteen versts. I've got good horses, doctor. I give you my
      word of honour that I'll take you there and back in an hour. Only an
      hour."
    

      The last words impressed the doctor more strongly than the references to
      humanity or the doctor's vocation. He thought for a while and said with a
      sigh.
    

      "Well, let us go!"
    

      He went off quickly, with a step that was now sure, to his study and soon
      after returned in a long coat. Aboguin, delighted, danced impatiently
      round him, helped him on with his overcoat, and accompanied him out of the
      house.
    

      Outside it was dark, but brighter than in the hall. Now in the darkness
      the tall stooping figure of the doctor was clearly visible with the long,
      narrow beard and the aquiline nose. Besides his pale face Aboguin's big
      face could now be seen and a little student's cap which hardly covered the
      crown of his head. The scarf showed white only in front, but behind it was
      hid under his long hair.
    

      "Believe me, I'm able to appreciate your magnanimity," murmured Aboguin,
      as he helped the doctor to a seat in the carriage. "We'll whirl away.
      Luke, dear man, drive as fast as you can, do!"
    

      The coachman drove quickly. First appeared a row of bare buildings, which
      stood along the hospital yard. It was dark everywhere, save that at the
      end of the yard a bright light from someone's window broke through the
      garden fence, and three windows in the upper story of the separate house
      seemed to be paler than the air. Then the carriage drove into dense
      obscurity where you could smell mushroom damp, and hear the whisper of the
      trees. The noise of the wheels awoke the rooks who began to stir in the
      leaves and raised a doleful, bewildered cry as if they knew that the
      doctor's son was dead and Aboguin's wife ill. Then began to appear
      separate trees, a shrub. Sternly gleamed the pond, where big black shadows
      slept. The carriage rolled along over an even plain. Now the cry of the
      rooks was but faintly heard far away behind. Soon it became completely
      still.
    

      Almost all the way Kirilov and Aboguin were silent; save that once Aboguin
      sighed profoundly and murmured.
    

      "It's terrible pain. One never loves his nearest so much as when there is
      the risk of losing them."
    

      And when the carriage was quietly passing through the river, Kirilov gave
      a sudden start, as though the dashing of the water frightened him, and he
      began to move impatiently.
    

      "Let me go," he said in anguish. "I'll come to you later. I only want to
      send the attendant to my wife. She is all alone."
    

      Aboguin was silent. The carriage, swaying and rattling against the stones,
      drove over the sandy bank and went on. Kirilov began to toss about in
      anguish, and glanced around. Behind the road was visible in the scant
      light of the stars and the willows that fringed the bank disappearing into
      the darkness. To the right the plain stretched smooth and boundless as
      heaven. On it in the distance here and there dim lights were burning,
      probably on the turf-pits. To the left, parallel with the road stretched a
      little hill, tufted with tiny shrubs, and on the hill a big half-moon
      stood motionless, red, slightly veiled with a mist, and surrounded with
      fine clouds which seemed to be gazing upon it from every side, and
      guarding it, lest it should disappear.
    

      In all nature one felt something hopeless and sick. Like a fallen woman
      who sits alone in a dark room trying not to think of her past, the earth
      languished with reminiscence of spring and summer and waited in apathy for
      ineluctable winter. Wherever one's glance turned nature showed everywhere
      like a dark, cold, bottomless pit, whence neither Kirilov nor Aboguin nor
      the red half-moon could escape....
    

      The nearer the carriage approached the destination the more impatient did
      Aboguin become. He moved about, jumped up and stared over the driver's
      shoulder in front of him. And when at last the carriage drew up at the
      foot of the grand staircase, nicely covered with a striped linen awning
      and he looked up at the lighted windows of the first floor one could hear
      his breath trembling.
    

      "If anything happens ... I shan't survive it," he said entering the hall
      with the doctor and slowly rubbing his hands in his agitation. "But I
      can't hear any noise. That means it's all right so far," he added,
      listening to the stillness.
    

      No voices or steps were heard in the hall. For all the bright illumination
      the whole house seemed asleep. Now the doctor and Aboguin who had been in
      darkness up till now could examine each other. The doctor was tall, with a
      stoop, slovenly dressed, and his face was plain. There was something
      unpleasantly sharp, ungracious, and severe in his thick negro lips, his
      aquiline nose and his faded, indifferent look. His tangled hair, his
      sunken temples, the early grey in his long thin beard, that showed his
      shining chin, his pale grey complexion and the slipshod awkwardness of his
      manners—the hardness of it all suggested to the mind bad times
      undergone, an unjust lot and weariness of life and men. To look at the
      hard figure of the man, you could not believe that he had a wife and could
      weep over his child. Aboguin revealed something different. He was robust,
      solid and fair-haired, with a big head and large, yet soft, features,
      exquisitely dressed in the latest fashion. In his carriage, his
      tight-buttoned coat and his mane of hair you felt something noble and
      leonine. He walked with his head straight and his chest prominent, he
      spoke in a pleasant baritone, and in his manner of removing his scarf or
      arranging his hair there appeared a subtle, almost feminine, elegance.
      Even his pallor and childish fear as he glanced upwards to the staircase
      while taking off his coat, did not disturb his carriage or take from the
      satisfaction, the health and aplomb which his figure breathed.
    

      "There's no one about, nothing I can hear," he said walking upstairs. "No
      commotion. May God be good!"
    

      He accompanied the doctor through the hall to a large salon, where a big
      piano showed dark and a lustre hung in a white cover. Thence they both
      passed into a small and beautiful drawing-room, very cosy, filled with a
      pleasant, rosy half-darkness.
    

      "Please sit here a moment, Doctor," said Aboguin, "I ... I won't be a
      second. I'll just have a look and tell them."
    

      Kirilov was left alone. The luxury of the drawing-room, the pleasant
      half-darkness, even his presence in a stranger's unfamiliar house
      evidently did not move him. He sat in a chair looking at his hands burnt
      with carbolic acid. He had no more than a glimpse of the bright red
      lampshade, the cello case, and when he looked sideways across the room to
      where the dock was ticking, he noticed a stuffed wolf, as solid and
      satisfied as Aboguin himself.
    

      It was still.... Somewhere far away in the other rooms someone uttered a
      loud "Ah!" A glass door, probably a cupboard door, rang, and again
      everything was still. After five minutes had passed, Kirilov did not look
      at his hands any more. He raised his eyes to the door through which
      Aboguin had disappeared.
    

      Aboguin was standing on the threshold, but not the same man as went out.
      The expression of satisfaction and subtle elegance had disappeared from
      him. His face and hands, the attitude of his body were distorted with a
      disgusting expression either of horror or of tormenting physical pain. His
      nose, lips, moustache, all his features were moving and as it were trying
      to tear themselves away from his face, but the eyes were as though
      laughing from pain.
    

      Aboguin took a long heavy step into the middle of the room, stooped,
      moaned, and shook his fists.
    

      "Deceived!" he cried, emphasising the syllable cei. "She deceived
      me! She's gone! She fell ill and sent me for the doctor only to run away
      with this fool Papchinsky. My God!" Aboguin stepped heavily towards the
      doctor, thrust his white soft fists before his face, and went on wailing,
      shaking his fists the while.
    

      "She's gone off! She's deceived me! But why this lie? My God, my God! Why
      this dirty, foul trick, this devilish, serpent's game? What have I done to
      her? She's gone off." Tears gushed from his eyes. He turned on his heel
      and began to pace the drawing-room. Now in his short jacket and his
      fashionable narrow trousers in which his legs seemed too thin for his
      body, he was extraordinarily like a lion. Curiosity kindled in the
      doctor's impassive face. He rose and eyed Aboguin.
    

      "Well, where's the patient?"
    

      "The patient, the patient," cried Aboguin, laughing, weeping, and still
      shaking his fists. "She's not ill, but accursed. Vile—dastardly. The
      Devil himself couldn't have planned a fouler trick. She sent me so that
      she could run away with a fool, an utter clown, an Alphonse! My God, far
      better she should have died. I'll not bear it. I shall not bear it."
    

      The doctor stood up straight. His eyes began to blink, filled with tears;
      his thin beard began to move with his jaw right and left.
    

      "What's this?" he asked, looking curiously about. "My child's dead. My
      wife in anguish, alone in all the house.... I can hardly stand on my feet,
      I haven't slept for three nights ... and I'm made to play in a vulgar
      comedy, to play the part of a stage property! I don't ... I don't
      understand it!"
    

      Aboguin opened one fist, flung a crumpled note on the floor and trod on
      it, as upon an insect he wished to crush.
    

      "And I didn't see ... didn't understand," he said through his set teeth,
      brandishing one fist round his head, with an expression as though someone
      had trod on a corn. "I didn't notice how he came to see us every day. I
      didn't notice that he came in a carriage to-day! What was the carriage
      for? And I didn't see! Innocent!"
    

      "I don't ... I don't understand," the doctor murmured. "What's it all
      mean? It's jeering at a man, laughing at a man's suffering! That's
      impossible.... I've never seen it in my life before!"
    

      With the dull bewilderment of a man who has just begun to understand that
      someone has bitterly offended him, the doctor shrugged his shoulders,
      waved his hands and not knowing what to say or do, dropped exhausted into
      a chair.
    

      "Well, she didn't love me any more. She loved another man. Very well. But
      why the deceit, why this foul treachery?" Aboguin spoke with tears in his
      voice. "Why, why? What have I done to you? Listen, doctor," he said
      passionately approaching Kirilov. "You were the unwilling witness of my
      misfortune, and I am not going to hide the truth from you. I swear I loved
      this woman. I loved her with devotion, like a slave. I sacrificed
      everything for her. I broke with my family, I gave up the service and my
      music. I forgave her things I could not have forgiven my mother and
      sister.... I never once gave her an angry look ... I never gave her any
      cause. Why this lie then? I do not demand love, but why this abominable
      deceit? If you don't love any more then speak out honestly, above all when
      you know what I feel about this matter...."
    

      With tears in his eyes and trembling in all his bones, Aboguin was pouring
      out his soul to the doctor. He spoke passionately, pressing both hands to
      his heart. He revealed all the family secrets without hesitation, as
      though he were glad that these secrets were being tom from his heart. Had
      he spoken thus for an hour or two and poured out all his soul, he would
      surely have been easier.
    

      Who can say whether, had the doctor listened and given him friendly
      sympathy, he would not, as so often happens, have been reconciled to his
      grief unprotesting, without turning to unprofitable follies? But it
      happened otherwise. While Aboguin was speaking the offended doctor changed
      countenance visibly. The indifference and amazement in his face gradually
      gave way to an expression of bitter outrage, indignation, and anger. His
      features became still sharper, harder, and more forbidding. When Aboguin
      put before his eyes the photograph of his young wife, with a pretty, but
      dry, inexpressive face like a nun's, and asked if it were possible to look
      at that face and grant that it could express a lie, the doctor suddenly
      started away, with flashing eyes, and said, coarsely forging out each
      several word:
    

      "Why do you tell me all this? I do not want to hear! I don't want to," he
      cried and banged his fist upon the table. "I don't want your trivial
      vulgar secrets—to Hell with them. You dare not tell me such
      trivialities. Or do you think I have not yet been insulted enough! That
      I'm a lackey to whom you can give the last insult? Yes?"
    

      Aboguin drew back from Kirilov and stared at him in surprise.
    

      "Why did you bring me here?" the doctor went on, shaking his beard. "You
      marry out of high spirits, get angry out of high spirits, and make a
      melodrama—but where do I come in? What have I got to do with your
      romances? Leave me alone I Get on with your noble grabbing, parade your
      humane ideas, play—" the doctor gave a side-glance at the cello-case—"the
      double-bass and the trombone, stuff yourselves like capons, but don't dare
      to jeer at a real man! If you can't respect him, then you can at least
      spare him your attentions."
    

      "What does all this mean?" Aboguin asked, blushing.
    

      "It means that it's vile and foul to play with a man I I'm a doctor. You
      consider doctors and all men who work and don't reek of scent and
      harlotry, your footmen, your mauvais tons. Very well, but no one
      gave you the right to turn a man who suffers into a property."
    

      "How dare you say that?" Aboguin asked quietly. Again his face began to
      twist about, this time in visible anger.
    

      "How dare you bring me here to listen to trivial rubbish, when you
      know that I'm in sorrow?" the doctor cried and banged his fists on the
      table once more. "Who gave you the right to jeer at another's grief?"
    

      "You're mad," cried Aboguin. "You're ungenerous. I too am deeply unhappy
      and ... and ..."
    

      "Unhappy"—the doctor gave a sneering laugh—"Don't touch the
      word, it's got nothing to do with you. Wasters who can't get money on a
      bill call themselves unhappy too. A capon's unhappy, oppressed with all
      its superfluous fat. You worthless lot!"
    

      "Sir, you're forgetting yourself," Aboguin gave a piercing scream. "For
      words like those, people are beaten. Do you understand?"
    

      Aboguin thrust his hand into his side pocket, took out a pocket-book,
      found two notes and flung them on the table.
    

      "There's your fee," he said, and his nostrils trembled. "You're paid."
    

      "You dare not offer me money," said the doctor, and brushed the notes from
      the table to the floor. "You don't settle an insult with money."
    

      Aboguin and the doctor stood face to face, heaping each other with
      undeserved insults. Never in their lives, even in a frenzy, had they said
      so much that was unjust and cruel and absurd. In both the selfishness of
      the unhappy is violently manifest. Unhappy men are selfish, wicked,
      unjust, and less able to understand each other than fools. Unhappiness
      does not unite people, but separates them; and just where one would
      imagine that people should be united by the community of grief, there is
      more injustice and cruelty done than among the comparatively contented.
    

      "Send me home, please," the doctor cried, out of breath.
    

      Aboguin rang the bell violently. Nobody came. He rang once more; then
      flung the bell angrily to the floor. It struck dully on the carpet and
      gave out a mournful sound like a death-moan. The footman appeared.
    

      "Where have you been hiding, damn you?" The master sprang upon him with
      clenched fists. "Where have you been just now? Go away and tell them to
      said the carriage round for this gentleman, and get the brougham ready for
      me. Wait," he called out as the footman turned to go. "Not a single
      traitor remains to-morrow. Pack off all of you! I will engage new ones ...
      Rabble!"
    

      While they waited Aboguin and the doctor were silent. Already the
      expression of satisfaction and the subtle elegance had returned to the
      former. He paced the drawing-room, shook his head elegantly and evidently
      was planning something. His anger was not yet cool, but he tried to make
      as if he did not notice his enemy.... The doctor stood with one hand on
      the edge of the table, looking at Aboguin with that deep, rather cynical,
      ugly contempt with which only grief and an unjust lot can look, when they
      see satiety and elegance before them.
    

      A little later, when the doctor took his seat in the carriage and drove
      away, his eyes still glanced contemptuously. It was dark, much darker than
      an hour ago. The red half-moon had now disappeared behind the little hill,
      and the clouds which watched it lay in dark spots round the stars. The
      brougham with the red lamps began to rattle on the road and passed the
      doctor. It was Aboguin on his way to protest, to commit all manner of
      folly.
    

      All the way the doctor thought not of his wife or Andrey, but only of
      Aboguin and those who lived in the house he just left. His thoughts were
      unjust, inhuman, and cruel. He passed sentence on Aboguin, his wife,
      Papchinsky, and all those who live in rosy semi-darkness and smell of
      scent. All the way he hated them, and his heart ached with his contempt
      for them. The conviction he formed about them would last his life long.
    

      Time will pass and Kirilov's sorrow, but this conviction, unjust and
      unworthy of the human heart, will not pass, but will remain in the
      doctor's mind until the grave.
    





      Nicolai Ilyich Byelyaev, a Petersburg landlord, very fond of the
      racecourse, a well fed, pink young man of about thirty-two, once called
      towards evening on Madame Irnin—Olga Ivanovna—with whom he had
      a liaison, or, to use his own phrase, spun out a long and tedious
      romance. And indeed the first pages of this romance, pages of interest and
      inspiration, had been read long ago; now they dragged on and on, and
      presented neither novelty nor interest.
    

      Finding that Olga Ivanovna was not at home, my hero lay down a moment on
      the drawing-room sofa and began to wait.
    

      "Good evening, Nicolai Ilyich," he suddenly heard a child's voice say.
      "Mother will be in in a moment. She's gone to the dressmaker's with
      Sonya."
    

      In the same drawing-room on the sofa lay Olga Vassilievna's son, Alyosha,
      a boy about eight years old, well built, well looked after, dressed up
      like a picture in a velvet jacket and long black stockings. He lay on a
      satin pillow, and apparently imitating an acrobat whom he had lately seen
      in the circus, lifted up first one leg then the other. When his elegant
      legs began to be tired, he moved his hands, or he jumped up impetuously
      and then went on all fours, trying to stand with his legs in the air. All
      this he did with a most serious face, breathing heavily, as if he himself
      found no happiness in God's gift of such a restless body.
    

      "Ah, how do you do, my friend?" said Byelyaev. "Is it you? I didn't notice
      you. Is your mother well?"
    

      At the moment Alyosha had just taken hold of the toe of his left foot in
      his right hand and got into a most awkward pose. He turned head over
      heels, jumped up, and glanced from under the big, fluffy lampshade at
      Byelyaev.
    

      "How can I put it?" he said, shrugging his shoulders. "As a matter of
      plain fact mother is never well. You see she's a woman, and women, Nicolai
      Ilyich, have always some pain or another."
    

      For something to do, Byelyaev began to examine Alyosha's face. All the
      time he had been acquainted with Olga Ivanovna he had never once turned
      his attention to the boy and had completely ignored his existence. A boy
      is stuck in front of your eyes, but what is he doing here, what is his rÃ´le?—you
      don't want to give a single thought to the question.
    

      In the evening dusk Alyosha's face with a pale forehead and steady black
      eyes unexpectedly reminded Byelyaev of Olga Vassilievna as she was in the
      first pages of the romance. He had the desire to be affectionate to the
      boy.
    

      "Come here, whipper-snapper," he said. "Come and let me have a good look
      at you, quite close."
    

      The boy jumped off the sofa and ran to Byelyaev.
    

      "Well?" Nicolai Ilyich began, putting his hand on the thin shoulders. "And
      how are things with you?"
    

      "How shall I put it?... They used to be much better before."
    

      "How?"
    

      "Quite simple. Before, Sonya and I only had to do music and reading, and
      now we're given French verses to learn. You've had your hair cut lately?"
    

      "Yes, just lately."
    

      "That's why I noticed it. Your beard's shorter. May I touch it ... doesn't
      it hurt?"
    

      "No, not a bit."
    

      "Why is it that it hurts if you pull one hair, and when you pull a whole
      lot, it doesn't hurt a bit? Ah, ah I You know it's a pity you don't have
      side-whiskers. You should shave here, and at the sides ... and leave the
      hair just here."
    

      The boy pressed close to Byelyaev and began to play with his watch-chain.
    

      "When I go to the gymnasium," he said, "Mother is going to buy me a watch.
      I'll ask her to buy me a chain just like this. What a fine locket I Father
      has one just the same, but yours has stripes, here, and his has got
      letters.... Inside it's mother's picture. Father has another chain now,
      not in links, but like a ribbon...."
    

      "How do you know? Do you see your father?"
    

      "I? Mm ... no ... I ..."
    

      Alyosha blushed and in the violent confusion of being detected in a lie
      began to scratch the locket busily with his finger-nail. Byelyaev looked
      steadily at his face and asked:
    

      "Do you see your father?"
    

      "No ... no!"
    

      "But, be honest—on your honour. By your face I can see you're not
      telling me the truth. If you made a slip of the tongue by mistake, what's
      the use of shuffling. Tell me, do you see him? As one friend to another."
    

      Alyosha mused.
    

      "And you won't tell Mother?" he asked.
    

      "What next."
    

      "On your word of honour."
    

      "My word of honour."
    

      "Swear an oath."
    

      "What a nuisance you are! What do you take me for?"
    

      Alyosha looked round, made big eyes and began to whisper.
    

      "Only for God's sake don't tell Mother! Never tell it to anyone at all,
      because it's a secret. God forbid that Mother should ever get to know;
      then I and Sonya and Pelagueia will pay for it.... Listen. Sonya and I
      meet Father every Tuesday and Friday. When Pelagueia takes us for a walk
      before dinner, we go into Apfel's sweet-shop and Father's waiting for us.
      He always sits in a separate room, you know, where there's a splendid
      marble table and an ash-tray shaped like a goose without a back...."
    

      "And what do you do there?"
    

      "Nothing!—First, we welcome one another, then we sit down at a
      little table and Father begins to treat us to coffee and cakes. You know,
      Sonya eats meat-pies, and I can't bear pies with meat in them! I like them
      made of cabbage and eggs. We eat so much that afterwards at dinner we try
      to eat as much as we possibly can so that Mother shan't notice."
    

      "What do you talk about there?"
    

      "To Father? About anything. He kisses us and cuddles us, tells us all
      kinds of funny stories. You know, he says that he will take us to live
      with him when we are grown up. Sonya doesn't want to go, but I say 'Yes.'
      Of course, it'll be lonely without Mother; but I'll write letters to her.
      How funny: we could go to her for our holidays then—couldn't we?
      Besides, Father says that he'll buy me a horse. He's a splendid man. I
      can't understand why Mother doesn't invite him to live with her or why she
      says we mustn't meet him. He loves Mother very much indeed. He's always
      asking us how she is and what she's doing. When she was ill, he took hold
      of his head like this ... and ran, ran, all the time. He is always telling
      us to obey and respect her. Tell me, is it true that we're unlucky?"
    

      "H'm ... how?"
    

      "Father says so. He says: 'You are unlucky children.' It's quite strange
      to listen to him. He says: 'You are unhappy, I'm unhappy, and Mother's
      unhappy.' He says: 'Pray to God for yourselves and for her.'" Alyosha's
      eyes rested upon the stuffed bird and he mused.
    

      "Exactly...." snorted Byelyaev. "This is what you do. You arrange
      conferences in sweet-shops. And your mother doesn't know?" "N—no....
      How could she know? Pelagueia won't tell for anything. The day before
      yesterday Father stood us pears. Sweet, like jam. I had two."
    

      "H'm ... well, now ... tell me, doesn't your father speak about me?"
    

      "About you? How shall I put it?" Alyosha gave a searching glance to
      Byelyaev's face and shrugged his shoulders.
    

      "He doesn't say anything in particular."
    

      "What does he say, for instance?"
    

      "You won't be offended?"
    

      "What next? Why, does he abuse me?"
    

      "He doesn't abuse you, but you know ... he is cross with you. He says that
      it's through you that Mother's unhappy and that you ... ruined Mother. But
      he is so queer! I explain to him that you are good and never shout at
      Mother, but he only shakes his head."
    

      "Does he say those very words: that I ruined her?"
    

      "Yes. Don't be offended, Nicolai Ilyich!"
    

      Byelyaev got up, stood still a moment, and then began to walk about the
      drawing-room.
    

      "This is strange, and ... funny," he murmured, shrugging his shoulders and
      smiling ironically. "He is to blame all round, and now I've ruined her,
      eh? What an innocent lamb! Did he say those very words to you: that I
      ruined your mother?"
    

      "Yes, but ... you said that you wouldn't get offended."
    

      "I'm not offended, and ... and it's none of your business! No, it ... it's
      quite funny though. I fell, into the trap, yet I'm to be blamed as well."
    

      The bell rang. The boy dashed from his place and ran out. In a minute a
      lady entered the room with a little girl. It was Olga Ivanovna, Alyosha's
      mother. After her, hopping, humming noisily, and waving his hands,
      followed Alyosha.
    

      "Of course, who is there to accuse except me?" he murmured, sniffing.
      "He's right, he's the injured husband."
    

      "What's the matter?" asked Olga Ivanovna.
    

      "What's the matter! Listen to the kind of sermon your dear husband
      preaches. It appears I'm a scoundrel and a murderer, I've ruined you and
      the children. All of you are unhappy, and only I am awfully happy!
      Awfully, awfully happy!"
    

      "I don't understand, Nicolai! What is it?"
    

      "Just listen to this young gentleman," Byelyaev said, pointing to Alyosha.
    

      Alyosha blushed, then became pale suddenly and his whole face was twisted
      in fright.
    

      "Nicolai Ilyich," he whispered loudly. "Shh!"
    

      Olga Ivanovna glanced in surprise at Alyosha, at Byelyaev, and then again
      at Alyosha.
    

      "Ask him, if you please," went on Byelyaev. "That stupid fool Pelagueia of
      yours, takes them to sweet-shops and arranges meetings with their dear
      father there. But that's not the point. The point is that the dear father
      is a martyr, and I'm a murderer, I'm a scoundrel, who broke the lives of
      both of you...."
    

      "Nicolai Ilyich!" moaned Alyosha. "You gave your word of honour!"
    

      "Ah, let me alone!" Byelyaev waved his hand. "This is something more
      important than any words of honour. The hypocrisy revolts me, the lie!"
    

      "I don't understand," muttered Olga Ivanovna, and tears began to glimmer
      in her eyes. "Tell me, Lyolka,"—she turned to her son, "Do you see
      your father?"
    

      Alyosha did not hear and looked with horror at Byelyaev.
    

      "It's impossible," said the mother. "I'll go and ask Pelagueia."
    

      Olga Ivanovna went out.
    

      "But, but you gave me your word of honour," Alyosha said trembling all
      over.
    

      Byelyaev waved his hand at him and went on walking up and down. He was
      absorbed in his insult, and now, as before, he did not notice the presence
      of the boy. He, a big serious man, had nothing to do with boys. And
      Alyosha sat down in a corner and in terror told Sonya how he had been
      deceived. He trembled, stammered, wept. This was the first time in his
      life that he had been set, roughly, face to face with a lie. He had never
      known before that in this world besides sweet pears and cakes and
      expensive watches, there exist many other things which have no name in
      children's language.
    





      When she came out of the hospital the charming Vanda, or, according to her
      passport, "the honourable lady-citizen Nastasya Kanavkina," found herself
      in a position in which she had never been before: without a roof and
      without a son. What was to be done?
    

      First of all, she went to a pawnshop to pledge her turquoise ring, her
      only jewellery. They gave her a rouble for the ring ... but what can you
      buy for a rouble? For that you can't get a short jacket Ã  la mode,
      or an elaborate hat, or a pair of brown shoes; yet without these things
      she felt naked. She felt as though, not only the people, but even the
      horses and dogs were staring at her and laughing at the plainness of her
      clothes. And her only thought was for her clothes; she did not care at all
      what she ate or where she slept.
    

      "If only I were to meet a gentleman friend...." she thought. "I could get
      some money ... Nobody would say 'No,' because...."
    

      But she came across no gentleman Mends. It's easy to find them of nights
      in the Renaissance, but they wouldn't let her go into the Renaissance
      in that plain dress and without a hat. What's to be done? After a long
      time of anguish, vexed and weary with walking, sitting, and thinking,
      Vanda made up her mind to play her last card: to go straight to the rooms
      of some gentleman friend and ask him for money.
    

      "But who shall I go to?" she pondered. "I can't possibly go to Misha ...
      he's got a family.... The ginger-headed old man is at his office...."
    

      Vanda recollected Finkel, the dentist, the converted Jew, who gave her a
      bracelet three months ago. Once she poured a glass of beer on his head at
      the German dub. She was awfully glad that she had thought of Finkel.
    

      "He'll be certain to give me some, if only I find him in..." she thought,
      on her way to him. "And if he won't, then I'll break every single thing
      there."
    

      She had her plan already prepared. She approached the dentist's door. She
      would run up the stairs, with a laugh, fly into his private room and ask
      for twenty-five roubles.... But when she took hold of the bell-pull, the
      plan went clean out of her head. Vanda suddenly began to be afraid and
      agitated, a thing which had never happened to her before. She was never
      anything but bold and independent in drunken company; but now, dressed in
      common clothes, and just like any ordinary person begging a favour, she
      felt timid and humble.
    

      "Perhaps he has forgotten me..." she thought, not daring to pull the bell.
      "And how can I go up to him in a dress like this? As if I were a pauper,
      or a dowdy respectable..."
    

      She rang the bell irresolutely.
    

      There were steps behind the door. It was the porter.
    

      "Is the doctor at home?" she asked.
    

      She would have been very pleased now if the porter had said "No," but
      instead of answering he showed her into the hall, and took her jacket. The
      stairs seemed to her luxurious and magnificent, but what she noticed first
      of all in all the luxury was a large mirror in which she saw a ragged
      creature without an elaborate hat, without a modish jacket, and without a
      pair of brown shoes. And Vanda found it strange that, now that she was
      poorly dressed and looking more like a seamstress or a washerwoman, for
      the first time she felt ashamed, and had no more assurance or boldness
      left. In her thoughts she began to call herself Nastya Kanavkina, instead
      of Vanda as she used.
    

      "This way, please!" said the maid-servant, leading her to the private
      room. "The doctor will be here immediately.... Please, take a seat."
    

      Vanda dropped into an easy chair.
    

      "I'll say: 'Lend me ...'" she thought. "That's the right thing, because we
      are acquainted. But the maid must go out of the room.... It's awkward in
      front of the maid.... What is she standing there for?"
    

      In five minutes the door opened and Finkel entered—a tall, swarthy,
      convert Jew, with fat cheeks and goggle-eyes. His cheeks, eyes, belly,
      fleshy hips—were all so full, repulsive, and coarse! At the Renaissance
      and the German club he used always to be a little drunk, to spend a lot of
      money on women, patiently put up with all their tricks—for instance,
      when Vanda poured the beer on his head, he only smiled and shook his
      finger at her—but now he looked dull and sleepy; he had the pompous,
      chilly expression of a superior, and he was chewing something.
    

      "What is the matter?" he asked, without looking at Vanda. Vanda glanced at
      the maid's serious face, at the blown-out figure of Finkel, who obviously
      did not recognise her, and she blushed.
    

      "What's the matter?" the dentist repeated, irritated.
    

      "To ... oth ache...." whispered Vanda.
    

      "Ah ... which tooth ... where?"
    

      Vanda remembered she had a tooth with a hole.
    

      "At the bottom ... to the right," she said.
    

      "H'm ... open your mouth."
    

      Finkel frowned, held his breath, and began to work the aching tooth loose.
    

      "Do you feel any pain?" he asked, picking at her tooth with some
      instrument.
    

      "Yes, I do...." Vanda lied. "Shall I remind him?" she thought, "he'll be
      sure to remember.... But ... the maid ... what is she standing there for?"
    

      Finkel suddenly snorted like a steam-engine straight into her mouth, and
      said:
    

      "I don't advise you to have a stopping.... Anyhow the tooth is quite
      useless."
    

      Again he picked at the tooth for a little, and soiled Vanda's lips and
      gums with his tobacco-stained fingers. Again he held his breath and dived
      into her mouth with something cold....
    

      Vanda suddenly felt a terrible pain, shrieked and seized Finkel's hand....
    

      "Never mind...." he murmured. "Don't be frightened.... This tooth isn't
      any use."
    

      And his tobacco-stained fingers, covered with blood, held up the extracted
      tooth before her eyes. The maid came forward and put a bowl to her lips.
    

      "Rinse your mouth with cold water at home," said Finkel. "That will make
      the blood stop."
    

      He stood before her in the attitude of a man impatient to be left alone at
      last.
    

      "Good-bye ..." she said, turning to the door.
    

      "H'm! And who's to pay me for the work?" Finkel asked laughingly.
    

      "Ah ... yes!" Vanda recollected, blushed and gave the dentist the rouble
      she had got for the turquoise ring.
    

      When she came into the street she felt still more ashamed than before, but
      she was not ashamed of her poverty any more. Nor did she notice any more
      that she hadn't an elaborate hat or a modish jacket. She walked along the
      street spitting blood and each red spittle told her about her life, a bad,
      hard life; about the insults she had suffered and had still to
      suffer-to-morrow, a week, a year hence—her whole life, till
      death....
    

      "Oh, how terrible it is!" she whispered. "My God, how terrible!"
    

      But the next day she was at the Renaissance and she danced there.
      She wore a new, immense red hat, a new jacket Ã  la mode and a pair
      of brown shoes. She was treated to supper by a young merchant from Kazan.
    





      This happened not so very long ago in the Moscow Circuit Court. The
      jurymen, left in court for the night, before going to bed, began a
      conversation about overwhelming sensations. It was occasioned by someone's
      recollection of a witness who became a stammerer and turned grey, owing,
      as he said, to one dreadful moment. The jurymen decided before going to
      bed that each one of them should dig into his memories and tell a story.
      Life is short; but still there is not a single man who can boast that he
      had not had some dreadful moments in his past.
    

      One juryman related how he was nearly drowned. A second told how one night
      he poisoned his own child, in a place where there was neither doctor nor
      chemist, by giving the child white copperas in mistake for soda. The child
      did not die, but the father nearly went mad. A third, not an old man, but
      sickly, described his two attempts to commit suicide. Once he shot
      himself; the second time he threw himself in front of a train.
    

      The fourth, a short, stout man, smartly dressed, told the following story:
    

      "I was no more than twenty-two or twenty-three years old, when I fell head
      over heels in love with my present wife and proposed to her. Now, I would
      gladly give myself a thrashing for that early marriage; but then—well,
      I don't know what would have happened to me if Natasha had refused. My
      love was most ardent, the kind described in novels as mad, passionate, and
      so on. My happiness choked me, and I did not know how to escape from it. I
      bored my father, my friends, the servants by continually telling them how
      desperately I was in love. Happy people are quite the most tiresome and
      boring. I used to be awfully exasperating. Even now I'm ashamed.
    

      "At the time I had a newly-called barrister among my friends. The
      barrister is now known all over Russia, but then he was only at the
      beginning of his popularity, and he was not rich or famous enough to have
      the right not to recognise a friend when he met him or not to raise his
      hat. I used to go and see him once or twice a week.
    

      "When I came, we used both to stretch ourselves upon the sofas and begin
      to philosophise.
    

      "Once I lay on the sofa, harping on the theme that there is no more
      ungrateful profession than a barrister's. I tried to show that after the
      witnesses have been heard the Court can easily dispense with the Crown
      Prosecutor and the barrister, because they are equally unnecessary and
      only hindrances. If an adult juryman, sound in spirit and mind, is
      convinced that this ceiling is white, or that Ivanov is guilty, no
      Demosthenes has the power to fight and overcome his conviction. Who can
      convince me that my moustache is carroty when I know it is black? When I
      listen to an orator I may perhaps get sentimental and even shed a tear,
      but my rooted convictions, for the most part based on the obvious and on
      facts, will not be changed an atom. My friend the barrister contended that
      I was still young and silly and was talking childish nonsense. In his
      opinion an obvious fact when illumined by conscientious experts became
      still more obvious. That was his first point. His second was that a talent
      is a force, an elemental power, a hurricane, that is able to turn even
      stones to dust, not to speak of such trifles as the convictions of
      householders and small shopkeepers. It is as hard for human frailty to
      struggle against a talent as it is to look at the sun without being
      blinded or to stop the wind. By the power of the word one single mortal
      converts thousands of convinced savages to Christianity. Ulysses was the
      most convinced person in the world, but he was all submission before the
      Syrens, and so on. All history is made up of such instances. In life we
      meet them at every turn. And so it ought to be; otherwise a clever person
      of talent would not be preferred before the stupid and untalented.
    

      "I persisted and continued to argue that a conviction is stronger than any
      talent, though, speaking frankly, I myself could not define what exactly
      is a conviction and what is a talent. Probably I talked only for the sake
      of talking.
    

      "'Take even your own case' ... said the barrister. 'You are convinced that
      your fiancÃ©e is an angel and that there's not a man in all the town
      happier than you. I tell you, ten or twenty minutes would be quite enough
      for me to make you sit down at this very table and write to break off the
      engagement.'
    

      "I began to laugh.
    

      "'Don't laugh. I'm talking seriously,' said my friend. 'If I only had the
      desire, in twenty minutes you would be happy in the thought that you have
      been saved from marriage. My talent is not great, but neither are you
      strong?'
    

      "'Well, try, please,' I said.
    

      "'No, why should I? I only said it in passing. You're a good boy. It would
      be a pity to expose you to such an experiment. Besides, I'm not in the
      mood, to-day.'
    

      "We sat down to supper. The wine and thoughts of Natasha and my love
      utterly filled me with a sense of youth and happiness. My happiness was so
      infinitely great that the green-eyed barrister opposite me seemed so
      unhappy, so little, so grey!"
    

      "'But do try,' I pressed him. 'I beg you.'
    

      "The barrister shook his head and knit his brows. Evidently I had begun to
      bore him.
    

      "'I know,' he said, 'that when the experiment is over you will thank me
      and call me saviour, but one must think of your sweetheart too. She loves
      you, and your refusal would make her suffer. But what a beauty she is 'I
      envy you.'
    

      "The barrister sighed, swallowed some wine, and began to speak of what a
      wonderful creature my Natasha was. He had an uncommon gift for
      description. He could pour out a whole heap of words about a woman's
      eyelashes or her little finger. I listened to him with delight.
    

      "'I've seen many women in my life-time;' he said, 'but I give you my word
      of honour, I tell you as a friend, your Natasha Andreevna is a gem, a rare
      girl! Of course, there are defects, even a good many, I grant you, but
      still she is charming.'
    

      "And the barrister began to speak of the defects of my sweetheart. Now I
      quite understand it was a general conversation about women, one about
      their weak points in general; but it appeared to me then as though he was
      speaking only of Natasha. He went into raptures about her snub-nose, her
      excited voice, her shrill laugh, her affectation—indeed, about
      everything I particularly disliked in her. All this was in his opinion
      infinitely amiable, gracious and feminine. Imperceptibly he changed from
      enthusiasm first to paternal edification, then to a light, sneering
      tone.... There was no Chairman of the Bench with us to stop the barrister
      riding the high horse. I hadn't a chance of opening my mouth—and
      what could I have said? My friend said nothing new, his truths were long
      familiar. The poison was not at all in what he said, but altogether in the
      devilish form in which he said it. A form of Satan's own invention! As I
      listened to him I was convinced that one and the same word had a thousand
      meanings and nuances according to the way it is pronounced and the turn
      given to the sentence. I certainly cannot reproduce the tone or the form.
      I can only say that as I listened to my friend and paced from corner to
      corner of my room, I was revolted, exasperated, contemptuous according as
      he felt. I even believed him when, with tears in his eyes, he declared to
      me that I was a great man, deserving a better fate, and destined in the
      future to accomplish some remarkable exploit, from which I might be
      prevented by my marriage.
    

      "'My dear friend,' he exclaimed, firmly grasping my hand, 'I implore you,
      I command you: stop before it is too late. Stop! God save you from this
      strange and terrible mistake! My friend, don't ruin your youth.'
    

      "Believe me or not as you will, but finally I sat down at the table and
      wrote to my sweetheart breaking off the engagement. I wrote and rejoiced
      that there was still time to repair my mistake. When the envelope was
      sealed I hurried into the street to put it in a pillar box. The barrister
      came with me.
    

      "'Splendid! Superb!' he praised me when my letter to Natasha disappeared
      into the darkness of the pillar-box. 'I congratulate you with all my
      heart. I'm delighted for your sake.'
    

      "After we had gone about ten steps together, the barrister continued:
    

      "'Of course, marriage has its bright side too. I, for instance, belong to
      the kind of men for whom marriage and family life are everything.'
    

      "He was already describing his life: all the ugliness of a lonely bachelor
      existence appeared before me.
    

      "He spoke with enthusiasm of his future wife, of the pleasures of an
      ordinary family life, and his transports were so beautiful and sincere
      that I was in absolute despair by the time we reached his door.
    

      "'What are you doing with me, you damnable man?' I said panting. 'You've
      ruined me! Why did you make me write that cursed letter? I love her! I
      love her!'
    

      "And I swore that I was in love. I was terrified of my action. It already
      seemed wild and absurd to me. Gentlemen, it is quite impossible to imagine
      a more overwhelming sensation than mine at that moment! If a kind man had
      happened to slip a revolver into my hand I would have put a bullet through
      my head gladly.
    

      "'Well, that's enough, enough!' the advocate said, patting my shoulder and
      beginning to laugh. 'Stop crying! The letter won't reach your sweetheart.
      It was I, not you, wrote the address on the envelope, and I muddled it up
      so that they won't be able to make anything of it at the post-office. But
      let this be a lesson to you. Don't discuss things you don't understand.'"
    

      "Now, gentlemen, next, please."
    

      The fifth juryman had settled himself comfortably and already opened his
      mouth to begin his story, when we heard the dock striking from Spaisky
      Church-tower.
    

      "Twelve...." one of the jurymen counted. "To which class, gentlemen, would
      you assign the sensations which our prisoner at the bar is now feeling?
      The murderer passes the night here in a prisoner's cell, either lying or
      sitting, certainly without sleeping and all through the sleepless night
      listens to the striking of the hours. What does he think of? What dreams
      visit him?"
    

      And all the jurymen suddenly forgot about overwhelming sensations. The
      experience of their friend, who once wrote the letter to his Natasha,
      seemed unimportant, and not even amusing. Nobody told any more stories;
      but they began to go to bed quietly, in silence.
    





      It is a great bore for an educated person not to know foreign languages.
      Vorotov felt it strongly, when on leaving the university after he had got
      his degree he occupied himself with a little scientific research.
    

      "It's awful!" he used to say, losing his breath (for although only
      twenty-six he was stout, heavy, and short of breath). "It's awful. Without
      knowing languages I'm like a bird without wings. I'll simply have to chuck
      the work."
    

      So he decided, come what might, to conquer his natural laziness and to
      study French and German, and he began to look out for a teacher.
    

      One winter afternoon, as Vorotov sat working in his study, the servant
      announced a lady to see him.
    

      "Show her in," said Vorotov.
    

      And a young lady, exquisitely dressed in the latest fashion, entered the
      study. She introduced herself as Alice Ossipovna Enquette, a teacher of
      French, and said that a friend of Vorotov's had sent her to him.
    

      "Very glad! Sit down!" said Vorotov, losing his breath, and clutching at
      the collar of his night shirt. (He always worked in a night shirt in order
      to breathe more easily.) "You were sent to me by Peter Sergueyevich?
      Yes.... Yes ... I asked him.... Very glad!"
    

      While he discussed the matter with Mademoiselle Enquette he glanced at her
      shyly, with curiosity. She was a genuine Frenchwoman, very elegant, and
      still quite young. From her pale and languid face, from her short, curly
      hair and unnaturally small waist, you would not think her more than
      eighteen, but looking at her broad, well-developed shoulders, her charming
      back and severe eyes, Vorotov decided that she was certainly not less than
      twenty-three, perhaps even twenty-five; but then again it seemed to him
      that she was only eighteen. Her face had the cold, business-like
      expression of one who had come to discuss a business matter. Never once
      did she smile or frown, and only once a look of perplexity flashed into
      her eyes, when she discovered that she was not asked to teach children but
      a grown up, stout young man.
    

      "So, Alice Ossipovna," Vorotov said to her, "you will give me a lesson
      daily from seven to eight o'clock in the evening. With regard to your wish
      to receive a rouble a lesson, I have no objection at all. A rouble—well,
      let it be a rouble...."
    

      And he went on asking her if she wanted tea or coffee, if the weather was
      fine, and, smiling good naturedly, stroking the tablecloth with the palm
      of his hand, he asked her kindly who she was, where she had completed her
      education, and how she earned her living.
    

      In a cold, business-like tone Alice Ossipovna answered that she had
      completed her education at a private school, and had then qualified as a
      domestic teacher, that her father had died recently of scarlet fever, her
      mother was alive and made artificial flowers, that she, Mademoiselle
      Enquette, gave private lessons at a pension in the morning, and from one
      o'clock right until the evening she taught in respectable private houses.
    

      She went, leaving a slight and almost imperceptible perfume of a woman's
      dress behind her. Vorotov did not work for a long time afterwards but sat
      at the table stroking the green cloth and thinking.
    

      "It's very pleasant to see girls earning their own living," he thought.
      "On the other hand it is very unpleasant to realise that poverty does not
      spare even such elegant and pretty girls as Alice Ossipovna; she, too,
      must struggle for her existence. Rotten luck!..."
    

      Having never seen virtuous Frenchwomen he also thought that this
      exquisitely dressed Alice Ossipovna, with her well-developed shoulders and
      unnaturally small waist was in all probability, engaged in something else
      besides teaching.
    

      Next evening when the clock pointed to five minutes to seven, Alice
      Ossipovna arrived, rosy from the cold; she opened Margot (an elementary
      text-book) and began without any preamble:
    

      "The French grammar has twenty-six letters. The first is called A, the
      second B...."
    

      "Pardon," interrupted Vorotov, smiling, "I must warn you, Mademoiselle,
      that you will have to change your methods somewhat in my case. The fact is
      that I know Russian, Latin and Greek very well. I have studied comparative
      philology, and it seems to me that we may leave out Margot and begin
      straight off to read some author." And he explained to the Frenchwoman how
      grown-up people study languages.
    

      "A friend of mine," said he, "who wished to know modern languages put a
      French, German and Latin gospel in front of him and then minutely analysed
      one word after another. The result—he achieved his purpose in less
      than a year. Let us take some author and start reading."
    

      The Frenchwoman gave him a puzzled look. It was evident that Vorotov's
      proposal appeared to her naive and absurd. If he had not been grown up she
      would certainly have got angry and stormed at him, but as he was a very
      stout, adult man at whom she could not storm, she only shrugged her
      shoulders half-perceptibly and said:
    

      "Just as you please."
    

      Vorotov ransacked his bookshelves and produced a ragged French book.
    

      "Will this do?" he asked.
    

      "It's all the same."
    

      "In that case let us begin. Let us start from the title, MÃ©moires."
    

      "Reminiscences...." translated Mademoiselle Enquette.
    

      "Reminiscences...." repeated Vorotov.
    

      Smiling good naturedly and breathing heavily, he passed a quarter of an
      hour over the word mÃ©moires and the same with the word de.
      This tired Alice Ossipovna out. She answered his questions carelessly, got
      confused and evidently neither understood her pupil nor tried to. Vorotov
      asked her questions, and at the same time glanced furtively at her fair
      hair, thinking:
    

      "The hair is not naturally curly. She waves it. Marvellous! She works from
      morning till night and yet she finds time to wave her hair."
    

      At eight o'clock sharp she got up, gave him a dry, cold "Au revoir,
      Monsieur," and left the study. After her lingered the same sweet, subtle,
      agitating perfume. The pupil again did nothing for a long time, but sat by
      the table and thought.
    

      During the following days he became convinced that his teacher was a
      charming girl serious and punctual, but very uneducated and incapable of
      teaching grown up people; so he decided he would not waste his time, but
      part with her and engage someone else. When she came for the seventh
      lesson he took an envelope containing seven roubles out of his pocket.
      Holding it in his hands and blushing furiously, he began:
    

      "I am sorry, Alice Ossipovna, but I must tell you.... I am placed in an
      awkward position...."
    

      The Frenchwoman glanced at the envelope and guessed what was the matter.
      For the first time during the lessons a shiver passed over her face and
      the cold, business-like expression disappeared. She reddened faintly, and
      casting her eyes down, began to play absently with her thin gold chain.
      And Vorotov, noticing her confusion, understood how precious this rouble
      was to her, how hard it would be for her to lose this money.
    

      "I must tell you," he murmured, getting still more confused. His heart
      gave a thump. Quickly he put the envelope back into his pocket and
      continued:
    

      "Excuse me. I ... I will leave you for ten minutes...."
    

      And as though he did not want to dismiss her at all, but had only asked
      permission to retire for a moment he went into another room and sat there
      for ten minutes. Then he returned, more confused than ever; he thought
      that his leaving her like that would be explained by her in a certain way
      and this made him awkward.
    

      The lessons began again.
    

      Vorotov wanted them no more. Knowing that they would lead to nothing he
      gave the Frenchwoman a free hand; he did not question or interrupt her any
      more. She translated at her own sweet will, ten pages a lesson, but he did
      not listen. He breathed heavily and for want of occupation gazed now and
      then at her curly little head, her neck, her soft white hands, and inhaled
      the perfume of her dress.
    

      He caught himself thinking about her as he ought not and it shamed him, or
      admiring her, and then he felt aggrieved and angry because she behaved so
      coldly towards him, in such a businesslike way, never smiling and as if
      afraid that he might suddenly touch her. All the while he thought: How
      could he inspire her with confidence in him, how could he get to know her
      better, to help her, to make her realise how badly she taught, poor little
      soul?
    

      Once Alice Ossipovna came to the lesson in a dainty pink dress, a little
      dÃ©colletÃ©, and such a sweet scent came from her that you might have
      thought she was wrapped in a cloud, that you had only to blow on her for
      her to fly away or dissolve like smoke. She apologised, saying she could
      only stay for half an hour, because she had to go straight from the lesson
      to a ball.
    

      He gazed at her neck, at her bare shoulders and he thought he understood
      why Frenchwomen were known to be light-minded and easily won; he was
      drowned in this cloud of scent, beauty, and nudity, and she, quite unaware
      of his thoughts and probably not in the least interested in them, read
      over the pages quickly and translated full steam ahead:
    

      "He walked over the street and met the gentleman of his friend and said:
      where do you rush? seeing your face so pale it makes me pain."
    

      The MÃ©moires had been finished long ago; Alice was now translating
      another book. Once she came to the lesson an hour earlier, apologising
      because she had to go to the Little Theatre at seven o'clock. When the
      lesson was over Vorotov dressed and he too went to the theatre. It seemed
      to him only for the sake of rest and distraction, and he did not even
      think of Alice. He would not admit that a serious man, preparing for a
      scientific career, a stay-at-home, should brush aside his book and rush to
      the theatre for the sake of meeting an unintellectual, stupid girl whom he
      hardly knew.
    

      But somehow, dining the intervals his heart beat, and, without noticing
      it, he ran about the foyer and the corridors like a boy, looking
      impatiently for someone. Every time the interval was over he was tired,
      but when he discovered the familiar pink dress and the lovely shoulders
      veiled with tulle his heart jumped as if from a presentiment of happiness,
      he smiled joyfully, and for the first time in his life he felt jealous.
    

      Alice was with two ugly students and an officer. She was laughing, talking
      loudly and evidently flirting. Vorotov had never seen her like that.
      Apparently she was happy, contented, natural, warm. Why? What was the
      reason? Perhaps because these people were dear to her and belonged to the
      same class as she. Vorotov felt the huge abyss between him and that class.
      He bowed to his teacher, but she nodded coldly and quietly passed by. It
      was plain she did not want her cavaliers to know that she had pupils and
      gave lessons because she was poor.
    

      After the meeting at the theatre Vorotov knew that he was in love. During
      lessons that followed he devoured his elegant teacher with his eyes, and
      no longer struggling, he gave full rein to his pure and impure thoughts.
      Alice's face was always cold. Exactly at eight o'clock every evening she
      said calmly, "Au revoir, Monsieur," and he felt that she was indifferent
      to him and would remain indifferent, that—his position was hopeless.
    

      Sometimes in the middle of a lesson he would begin dreaming, hoping,
      building plans; he composed an amorous declaration, remembering that
      Frenchwomen were frivolous and complaisant, but he had only to give his
      teacher one glance for his thoughts to be blown out like a candle, when
      you carry it on to the verandah of a bungalow and the wind is blowing.
      Once, overcome, forgetting everything, in a frenzy, he could stand it no
      longer. He barred her way when she came from the study into the hall after
      the lesson and, losing his breath and stammering, began to declare his
      love:
    

      "You are dear to me!... I love you. Please let me speak!"
    

      Alice grew pale: probably she was afraid that after this declaration she
      would not be able to come to him any more and receive a rouble a lesson.
      She looked at him with terrified eyes and began in a loud whisper:
    

      "Ah, it's impossible! Do not speak, I beg you! Impossible!"
    

      Afterwards Vorotov did not sleep all night; he tortured himself with
      shame, abused himself, thinking feverishly. He thought that his
      declaration had offended the girl and that she would not come any more. He
      made up his mind to find out where she lived from the Address Bureau and
      to write her an apology. But Alice came without the letter. For a moment
      she felt awkward, and then opened the book and began to translate quickly,
      in an animated voice, as always:
    

      "'Oh, young gentleman, do not rend these flowers in my garden which I want
      to give to my sick daughter.'"
    

      She still goes. Four books have been translated by now but Vorotov knows
      nothing beyond the word mÃ©moires, and when he is asked about his
      scientific research work he waves his hand, leaves the question
      unanswered, and begins to talk about the weather.
    





      State-Councillor Sharamykin's drawing-room is wrapped in a pleasant
      half-darkness. The big bronze lamp with the green shade, makes the walls,
      the furniture, the faces, all green, couleur "Nuit d'Ukraine"
      Occasionally a smouldering log flares up in the dying fire and for a
      moment casts a red glow over the faces; but this does not spoil the
      general harmony of light. The general tone, as the painters say, is well
      sustained.
    

      Sharamykin sits in a chair in front of the fireplace, in the attitude of a
      man who has just dined. He is an elderly man with a high official's grey
      side whiskers and meek blue eyes. Tenderness is shed over his face, and
      his lips are set in a melancholy smile. At his feet, stretched out lazily,
      with his legs towards the fire-place, Vice-Governor Lopniev sits on a
      little stool. He is a brave-looking man of about forty. Sharamykin's
      children are moving about round the piano; Nina, Kolya, Nadya, and Vanya.
      The door leading to Madame Sharamykin's room is slightly open and the
      light breaks through timidly. There behind the door sits Sharamykin's
      wife, Anna Pavlovna, in front of her writing-table. She is president of
      the local ladies' committee, a lively, piquant lady of thirty years and a
      little bit over. Through her pince-nez her vivacious black eyes are
      running over the pages of a French novel. Beneath the novel lies a
      tattered copy of the report of the committee for last year.
    

      "Formerly our town was much better off in these things," says Sharamykin,
      screwing up his meek eyes at the glowing coals. "Never a winter passed but
      some star would pay us a visit. Famous actors and singers used to come ...
      but now, besides acrobats and organ-grinders, the devil only knows what
      comes. There's no aesthetic pleasure at all.... We might be living in a
      forest. Yes.... And does your Excellency remember that Italian
      tragedian?... What's his name?... He was so dark, and tall.... Let me
      think.... Oh, yes! Luigi Ernesto di Ruggiero.... Remarkable talent.... And
      strength. He had only to say one word and the whole theatre was on the qui
      vive. My darling Anna used to take a great interest in his talent. She
      hired the theatre for him and sold tickets for the performances in
      advance.... In return he taught her elocution and gesture. A first-rate
      fellow! He came here ... to be quite exact ... twelve years ago.... No,
      that's not true.... Less, ten years.... Anna dear, how old is our Nina?"
    

      "She'll be ten next birthday," calls Anna Pavlovna from her room. "Why?"
    

      "Nothing in particular, my dear. I was just curious.... And good singers
      used to come. Do you remember Prilipchin, the tenore di grazia?
      What a charming fellow he was! How good looking! Fair ... a very
      expressive face, Parisian manners.... And what a voice, your Excellency!
      Only one weakness: he would sing some notes with his stomach and would
      take re falsetto—otherwise everything was good. Tamberlik, he
      said, had taught him.... My dear Anna and I hired a hall for him at the
      Social Club, and in gratitude for that he used to sing to us for whole
      days and nights.... He taught dear Anna to sing. He came—I remember
      it as though it were last night—in Lent, some twelve years ago. No,
      it's more.... How bad my memory is getting, Heaven help me! Anna dear, how
      old is our darling Nadya?
    

      "Twelve."
    

      "Twelve ... then we've got to add ten months.... That makes it exact ...
      thirteen. Somehow there used to be more life in our town then.... Take,
      for instance, the charity soirÃ©es. What enjoyable soirÃ©es we used to have
      before! How elegant! There were singing, playing, and recitation.... After
      the war, I remember, when the Turkish prisoners were here, dear Anna
      arranged a soiree on behalf of the wounded. We collected eleven hundred
      roubles. I remember the Turkish officers were passionately fond of dear
      Anna's voice, and kissed her hand incessantly. He-he! Asiatics, but a
      grateful nation. Would you believe me, the soiree was such a success that
      I wrote an account of it in my diary? It was,—I remember it as
      though it had only just happened,—in '76,... no, in '77.... No!
      Pray, when were the Turks here? Anna dear, how old is our little Kolya?"
    

      "I'm seven, Papa!" says Kolya, a brat with a swarthy face and coal black
      hair.
    

      "Yes, we're old, and we've lost the energy we used to have," Lopniev
      agreed with a sigh. "That's the real cause. Old age, my friend. No new
      moving spirits arrive, and the old ones grow old.... The old fire is dull
      now. When I was younger I did not like company to be bored.... I was your
      Anna Pavlovna's first assistant. Whether it was a charity soirÃ©e or a
      tombola to support a star who was going to arrive, whatever Anna Pavlovna
      was arranging, I used to throw over everything and begin to bustle about.
      One winter, I remember, I bustled and ran so much that I even got ill....
      I shan't forget that winter.... Do you remember what a performance we
      arranged with Anna Pavlovna in aid of the victims of the fire?"
    

      "What year was it?"
    

      "Not so very long ago.... In '79. No, in '80, I believe! Tell me how old
      is your Vanya?"
    

      "Five," Anna Pavlovna calls from the study.
    

      "Well, that means it was six years ago. Yes, my dear friend, that was a
      time. It's all over now. The old fire's quite gone."
    

      Lopniev and Sharamykin grew thoughtful. The smouldering log flares up for
      the last time, and then is covered in ash.
    





      State-Councillor Usielkov, architect, arrived in his native town, where he
      had been summoned to restore the cemetery church. He was born in the town,
      he had grown up and been married there, and yet when he got out of the
      train he hardly recognised it. Everything was changed. For instance,
      eighteen years ago, when he left the town to settle in Petersburg, where
      the railway station is now boys used to hunt for marmots: now as you come
      into the High Street there is a four storied "Hotel Vienna," with
      apartments, where there was of old an ugly grey fence. But not the fence
      or the houses, or anything had changed so much as the people. Questioning
      the hall-porter, Usielkov discovered that more than half of the people he
      remembered were dead or paupers or forgotten.
    

      "Do you remember Usielkov?" he asked the porter. "Usielkov, the architect,
      who divorced his wife.... He had a house in Sviribev Street.... Surely you
      remember."
    

      "No, I don't remember anyone of the name."
    

      "Why, it's impossible not to remember. It was an exciting case. All the
      cabmen knew, even. Try to remember. His divorce was managed by the
      attorney, Shapkin, the swindler ... the notorious sharper, the man who was
      thrashed at the dub...."
    

      "You mean Ivan Nicolaich?"
    

      "Yes.... Is he alive? dead?"
    

      "Thank heaven, his honour's alive. His honour's a notary now, with an
      office. Well-to-do. Two houses in Kirpichny Street. Just lately married
      his daughter off."
    

      Usielkov strode from one corner of the room to another. An idea flashed
      into his mind. From boredom, he decided to see Shapkin. It was afternoon
      when he left the hotel and quietly walked to Kirpichny Street. He found
      Shapkin in his office and hardly recognised him. From the well-built,
      alert attorney with a quick, impudent, perpetually tipsy expression,
      Shapkin had become a modest, grey-haired, shrunken old man.
    

      "You don't recognise me.... You have forgotten ...." Usielkov began. "I'm
      your old client, Usielkov."
    

      "Usielkov? Which Usielkov? Ah!" Remembrance came to Shapkin: he recognised
      him and was confused. Began exclamations, questions, recollections.
    

      "Never expected ... never thought...." chuckled Shapkin. "What will you
      have? Would you like champagne? Perhaps you'd like oysters. My dear man,
      what a lot of money I got out of you in the old days—so much that I
      can't think what I ought to stand you."
    

      "Please don't trouble," said Usielkov. "I haven't time. I must go to the
      cemetery and examine the church. I have a commission."
    

      "Splendid. We'll have something to eat and a drink and go together. I've
      got some splendid horses! I'll take you there and introduce you to the
      churchwarden.... I'll fix up everything.... But what's the matter, my
      dearest man? You're not avoiding me, not afraid? Please sit nearer.
      There's nothing to be afraid of now.... Long ago, I really was pretty
      sharp, a bit of a rogue ... but now I'm quieter than water, humbler than
      grass. I've grown old; got a family. There are children.... Time to die!"
    

      The friends had something to eat and drink, and went in a coach and pair
      to the cemetery.
    

      "Yes, it was a good time," Shapkin was reminiscent, sitting in the sledge.
      "I remember, but I simply can't believe it. Do you remember how you
      divorced your wife? It's almost twenty years ago, and you've probably
      forgotten everything, but I remember it as though I conducted the petition
      yesterday. My God, how rotten I was! Then I was a smart, casuistical
      devil, full of sharp practice and devilry.... and I used to run into some
      shady affairs, particularly when there was a good fee, as in your case,
      for instance. What was it you paid me then? Five—six hundred. Enough
      to upset anybody! By the time you left for Petersburg you'd left the whole
      affair completely in my hands. 'Do what you like!' And your former wife,
      Sophia Mikhailovna, though she did come from a merchant family, was proud
      and selfish. To bribe her to take the guilt on herself was difficult—extremely
      difficult. I used to come to her for a business talk, and when she saw me,
      she would say to her maid: 'Masha, surely I told you I wasn't at home to
      scoundrels.' I tried one way, then another ... wrote letters to her, tried
      to meet her accidentally—no good. I had to work through a third
      person. For a long time I had trouble with her, and she only yielded when
      you agreed to give her ten thousand. She could not stand out against ten
      thousand. She succumbed.... She began to weep, spat in my face, but she
      yielded and took the guilt on herself."
    

      "If I remember it was fifteen, not ten thousand she took from me," said
      Usielkov.
    

      "Yes, of course ... fifteen, my mistake." Shapkin was disconcerted.
      "Anyway it's all past and done with now. Why shouldn't I confess, frankly?
      Ten I gave to her, and the remaining five I bargained out of you for my
      own share. I deceived both of you.... It's all past, why be ashamed of it?
      And who else was there to take from, Boris Pietrovich, if not from you? I
      ask you.... You were rich and well-to-do. You married in caprice: you were
      divorced in caprice. You were making a fortune. I remember you got twenty
      thousand out of a single contract. Whom was I to tap, if not you? And I
      must confess, I was tortured by envy. If you got hold of a nice lot of
      money, people would take off their hats to you: but the same people would
      beat me for shillings and smack my face in the club. But why recall it?
      It's time to forget."
    

      "Tell me, please, how did Sophia Mikhailovna live afterwards?"
    

      "With her ten thousand? On ne peut plus badly.... God knows whether
      it was frenzy or pride and conscience that tortured her, because she had
      sold herself for money—or perhaps she loved you; but, she took to
      drink, you know. She received the money and began to gad about with
      officers in troikas.... Drunkenness, philandering, debauchery.... She
      would come into a tavern with an officer, and instead of port or a light
      wine, she would drink the strongest cognac to drive her into a frenzy."
    

      "Yes, she was eccentric. I suffered enough with her. She would take
      offence at some trifle and then get nervous.... And what happened
      afterwards?"
    

      "A week passed, a fortnight.... I was sitting at home writing. Suddenly,
      the door opened and she comes in. 'Take your cursed money,' she said, and
      threw the parcel in my face.... She could not resist it.... Five hundred
      were missing. She had only got rid of five hundred."
    

      "And what did you do with the money?"
    

      "It's all past and done with. What's the good of concealing it?... I
      certainly took it. What are you staring at me like that for? Wait for the
      sequel. It's a complete novel, the sickness of a soul! Two months passed
      by. One night I came home drunk, in a wicked mood.... I turned on the
      light and saw Sophia Mikhailovna sitting on my sofa, drunk too, wandering
      a bit, with something savage in her face as if she had just escaped from
      the mad-house. 'Give me my money back,' she said. 'I've changed my mind.
      If I'm going to the dogs, I want to go madly, passionately. Make haste,
      you scoundrel, give me the money.' How indecent it was!"
    

      "And you ... did you give it her?"
    

      "I remember I gave her ten roubles."
    

      "Oh ... is it possible?" Usielkov frowned. "If you couldn't do it
      yourself, or you didn't want to, you could have written to me.... And I
      didn't know ... I didn't know."
    

      "My dear man, why should I write, when she wrote herself afterwards when
      she was in hospital?"
    

      "I was so taken up with the new marriage that I paid no attention to
      letters.... But you were an outsider; you had no antagonism to Sophia
      Mikhailovna.... Why didn't you help her?"
    

      "We can't judge by our present standards, Boris Pietrovich. Now we think
      in this way; but then we thought quite differently.... Now I might perhaps
      give her a thousand roubles; but then even ten roubles ... she didn't get
      them for nothing. It's a terrible story. It's time to forget.... But here
      you are!"
    

      The sledge stopped at the churchyard gate. Usielkov and Shapkin got out of
      the sledge, went through the gate and walked along a long, broad avenue.
      The bare cherry trees, the acacias, the grey crosses and monuments
      sparkled with hoar-frost. In each flake of snow the bright sunny day was
      reflected. There was the smell you find in all cemeteries of incense and
      fresh-dug earth.
    

      "You have a beautiful cemetery," said Usielkov. "It's almost an orchard."
    

      "Yes, but it's a pity the thieves steal the monuments. Look, there, behind
      that cast-iron memorial, on the right, Sophia Mikhailovna is buried. Would
      you like to see?"
    

      The friends turned to the right, stepping in deep snow towards the
      cast-iron memorial.
    

      "Down here," said Shapkin, pointing to a little stone of white marble.
      "Some subaltern or other put up the monument on her grave." Usielkov
      slowly took off his hat and showed his bald pate to the snow. Eying him,
      Shapkin also took off his hat, and another baldness shone beneath the sun.
      The silence round about was like the tomb, as though the air were dead,
      too. The friends looked at the stone, silent, thinking.
    

      "She is asleep!" Shapkin broke the silence. "And she cares very little
      that she took the guilt upon herself and drank cognac. Confess, Boris
      Pietrovich!"
    

      "What?" asked Usielkov, sternly.
    

      "That, however loathsome the past may be, it's better than this." And
      Shapkin pointed to his grey hairs.
    

      "In the old days I did not even think of death.... If I'd met her, I would
      have circumvented her, but now ... well, now!"
    

      Sadness took hold of Usielkov. Suddenly he wanted to cry, passionately, as
      he once desired to love.... And he felt that these tears would be
      exquisite, refreshing. Moisture came out of his eyes and a lump rose in
      his throat, but.... Shapkin was standing by his side, and Usielkov felt
      ashamed of his weakness before a witness. He turned back quickly and
      walked towards the church.
    

      Two hours later, having arranged with the churchwarden and examined the
      church, he seized the opportunity while Shapkin was talking away to the
      priest, and ran to shed a tear. He walked to the stone surreptitiously,
      with stealthy steps, looking round all the time. The little white monument
      stared at him absently, so sadly and innocently, as though a girl and not
      a wanton divorcÃ©e were beneath.
    

      "If I could weep, could weep!" thought Usielkov.
    

      But the moment for weeping had been lost. Though the old man managed to
      make his eyes shine, and tried to bring himself to the right pitch, the
      tears did not flow and the lump did not rise in his throat.... After
      waiting for about ten minutes, Usielkov waved his arm and went to look for
+      Shapkin.
    



The Darling and Other Stories





THE DARLING


OLENKA, the daughter of the retired collegiate assessor, Plemyanniakov,
was sitting in her back porch, lost in thought. It was hot, the
flies were persistent and teasing, and it was pleasant to reflect
that it would soon be evening. Dark rainclouds were gathering from
the east, and bringing from time to time a breath of moisture in
the air.


Kukin, who was the manager of an open-air theatre called the Tivoli,
and who lived in the lodge, was standing in the middle of the garden
looking at the sky.


"Again!" he observed despairingly. "It's going to rain again! Rain
every day, as though to spite me. I might as well hang myself! It's
ruin! Fearful losses every day."


He flung up his hands, and went on, addressing Olenka:


"There! that's the life we lead, Olga Semyonovna. It's enough to
make one cry. One works and does one's utmost, one wears oneself
out, getting no sleep at night, and racks one's brain what to do
for the best. And then what happens? To begin with, one's public
is ignorant, boorish. I give them the very best operetta, a dainty
masque, first rate music-hall artists. But do you suppose that's
what they want! They don't understand anything of that sort. They
want a clown; what they ask for is vulgarity. And then look at the
weather! Almost every evening it rains. It started on the tenth of
May, and it's kept it up all May and June. It's simply awful! The
public doesn't come, but I've to pay the rent just the same, and
pay the artists."


The next evening the clouds would gather again, and Kukin would say
with an hysterical laugh:


"Well, rain away, then! Flood the garden, drown me! Damn my luck
in this world and the next! Let the artists have me up! Send me to
prison!--to Siberia!--the scaffold! Ha, ha, ha!"


And next day the same thing.


Olenka listened to Kukin with silent gravity, and sometimes tears
came into her eyes. In the end his misfortunes touched her; she
grew to love him. He was a small thin man, with a yellow face, and
curls combed forward on his forehead. He spoke in a thin tenor; as
he talked his mouth worked on one side, and there was always an
expression of despair on his face; yet he aroused a deep and genuine
affection in her. She was always fond of some one, and could not
exist without loving. In earlier days she had loved her papa, who
now sat in a darkened room, breathing with difficulty; she had loved
her aunt who used to come every other year from Bryansk; and before
that, when she was at school, she had loved her French master. She
was a gentle, soft-hearted, compassionate girl, with mild, tender
eyes and very good health. At the sight of her full rosy cheeks,
her soft white neck with a little dark mole on it, and the kind,
naÃ¯ve smile, which came into her face when she listened to anything
pleasant, men thought, "Yes, not half bad," and smiled too, while
lady visitors could not refrain from seizing her hand in the middle
of a conversation, exclaiming in a gush of delight, "You darling!"


The house in which she had lived from her birth upwards, and which
was left her in her father's will, was at the extreme end of the
town, not far from the Tivoli. In the evenings and at night she
could head the band playing, and the crackling and banging of
fireworks, and it seemed to her that it was Kukin struggling with
his destiny, storming the entrenchments of his chief foe, the
indifferent public; there was a sweet thrill at her heart, she had
no desire to sleep, and when he returned home at day-break, she
tapped softly at her bedroom window, and showing him only her face
and one shoulder through the curtain, she gave him a friendly
smile. . . .


He proposed to her, and they were married. And when he had a closer
view of her neck and her plump, fine shoulders, he threw up his
hands, and said:


"You darling!"


He was happy, but as it rained on the day and night of his wedding,
his face still retained an expression of despair.


They got on very well together. She used to sit in his office, to
look after things in the Tivoli, to put down the accounts and pay
the wages. And her rosy cheeks, her sweet, naÃ¯ve, radiant smile,
were to be seen now at the office window, now in the refreshment
bar or behind the scenes of the theatre. And already she used to
say to her acquaintances that the theatre was the chief and most
important thing in life and that it was only through the drama that
one could derive true enjoyment and become cultivated and humane.


"But do you suppose the public understands that?" she used to say.
"What they want is a clown. Yesterday we gave 'Faust Inside Out,'
and almost all the boxes were empty; but if Vanitchka and I had
been producing some vulgar thing, I assure you the theatre would
have been packed. Tomorrow Vanitchka and I are doing 'Orpheus in
Hell.' Do come."


And what Kukin said about the theatre and the actors she repeated.
Like him she despised the public for their ignorance and their
indifference to art; she took part in the rehearsals, she corrected
the actors, she kept an eye on the behaviour of the musicians, and
when there was an unfavourable notice in the local paper, she shed
tears, and then went to the editor's office to set things right.


The actors were fond of her and used to call her "Vanitchka and I,"
and "the darling"; she was sorry for them and used to lend them
small sums of money, and if they deceived her, she used to shed a
few tears in private, but did not complain to her husband.


They got on well in the winter too. They took the theatre in the
town for the whole winter, and let it for short terms to a Little
Russian company, or to a conjurer, or to a local dramatic society.
Olenka grew stouter, and was always beaming with satisfaction, while
Kukin grew thinner and yellower, and continually complained of their
terrible losses, although he had not done badly all the winter. He
used to cough at night, and she used to give him hot raspberry tea
or lime-flower water, to rub him with eau-de-Cologne and to wrap
him in her warm shawls.


"You're such a sweet pet!" she used to say with perfect sincerity,
stroking his hair. "You're such a pretty dear!"


Towards Lent he went to Moscow to collect a new troupe, and without
him she could not sleep, but sat all night at her window, looking
at the stars, and she compared herself with the hens, who are awake
all night and uneasy when the cock is not in the hen-house. Kukin
was detained in Moscow, and wrote that he would be back at Easter,
adding some instructions about the Tivoli. But on the Sunday before
Easter, late in the evening, came a sudden ominous knock at the
gate; some one was hammering on the gate as though on a barrel--
boom, boom, boom! The drowsy cook went flopping with her bare feet
through the puddles, as she ran to open the gate.


"Please open," said some one outside in a thick bass. "There is a
telegram for you."


Olenka had received telegrams from her husband before, but this
time for some reason she felt numb with terror. With shaking hands
she opened the telegram and read as follows:


"IVAN PETROVITCH DIED SUDDENLY TO-DAY. AWAITING IMMATE INSTRUCTIONS
FUFUNERAL TUESDAY."


That was how it was written in the telegram--"fufuneral," and the
utterly incomprehensible word "immate." It was signed by the stage
manager of the operatic company.


"My darling!" sobbed Olenka. "Vanka, my precious, my darling! Why
did I ever meet you! Why did I know you and love you! Your poor
heart-broken Olenka is alone without you!"


Kukin's funeral took place on Tuesday in Moscow, Olenka returned
home on Wednesday, and as soon as she got indoors, she threw herself
on her bed and sobbed so loudly that it could be heard next door,
and in the street.


"Poor darling!" the neighbours said, as they crossed themselves.
"Olga Semyonovna, poor darling! How she does take on!"


Three months later Olenka was coming home from mass, melancholy and
in deep mourning. It happened that one of her neighbours, Vassily
Andreitch Pustovalov, returning home from church, walked back beside
her. He was the manager at Babakayev's, the timber merchant's. He
wore a straw hat, a white waistcoat, and a gold watch-chain, and
looked more a country gentleman than a man in trade.


"Everything happens as it is ordained, Olga Semyonovna," he said
gravely, with a sympathetic note in his voice; "and if any of our
dear ones die, it must be because it is the will of God, so we ought
have fortitude and bear it submissively."


After seeing Olenka to her gate, he said good-bye and went on. All
day afterwards she heard his sedately dignified voice, and whenever
she shut her eyes she saw his dark beard. She liked him very much.
And apparently she had made an impression on him too, for not long
afterwards an elderly lady, with whom she was only slightly acquainted,
came to drink coffee with her, and as soon as she was seated at
table began to talk about Pustovalov, saying that he was an excellent
man whom one could thoroughly depend upon, and that any girl would
be glad to marry him. Three days later Pustovalov came himself. He
did not stay long, only about ten minutes, and he did not say much,
but when he left, Olenka loved him--loved him so much that she
lay awake all night in a perfect fever, and in the morning she sent
for the elderly lady. The match was quickly arranged, and then came
the wedding.


Pustovalov and Olenka got on very well together when they were
married.


Usually he sat in the office till dinner-time, then he went out on
business, while Olenka took his place, and sat in the office till
evening, making up accounts and booking orders.


"Timber gets dearer every year; the price rises twenty per cent,"
she would say to her customers and friends. "Only fancy we used to
sell local timber, and now Vassitchka always has to go for wood to
the Mogilev district. And the freight!" she would add, covering her
cheeks with her hands in horror. "The freight!"


It seemed to her that she had been in the timber trade for ages and
ages, and that the most important and necessary thing in life was
timber; and there was something intimate and touching to her in the
very sound of words such as "baulk," "post," "beam," "pole,"
"scantling," "batten," "lath," "plank," etc.


At night when she was asleep she dreamed of perfect mountains of
planks and boards, and long strings of wagons, carting timber
somewhere far away. She dreamed that a whole regiment of six-inch
beams forty feet high, standing on end, was marching upon the
timber-yard; that logs, beams, and boards knocked together with the
resounding crash of dry wood, kept falling and getting up again,
piling themselves on each other. Olenka cried out in her sleep, and
Pustovalov said to her tenderly: "Olenka, what's the matter, darling?
Cross yourself!"


Her husband's ideas were hers. If he thought the room was too hot,
or that business was slack, she thought the same. Her husband did
not care for entertainments, and on holidays he stayed at home. She
did likewise.


"You are always at home or in the office," her friends said to her.
"You should go to the theatre, darling, or to the circus."


"Vassitchka and I have no time to go to theatres," she would answer
sedately. "We have no time for nonsense. What's the use of these
theatres?"


On Saturdays Pustovalov and she used to go to the evening service;
on holidays to early mass, and they walked side by side with softened
faces as they came home from church. There was a pleasant fragrance
about them both, and her silk dress rustled agreeably. At home they
drank tea, with fancy bread and jams of various kinds, and afterwards
they ate pie. Every day at twelve o'clock there was a savoury smell
of beet-root soup and of mutton or duck in their yard, and on
fast-days of fish, and no one could pass the gate without feeling
hungry. In the office the samovar was always boiling, and customers
were regaled with tea and cracknels. Once a week the couple went
to the baths and returned side by side, both red in the face.


"Yes, we have nothing to complain of, thank God," Olenka used to
say to her acquaintances. "I wish every one were as well off as
Vassitchka and I."


When Pustovalov went away to buy wood in the Mogilev district, she
missed him dreadfully, lay awake and cried. A young veterinary
surgeon in the army, called Smirnin, to whom they had let their
lodge, used sometimes to come in in the evening. He used to talk
to her and play cards with her, and this entertained her in her
husband's absence. She was particularly interested in what he told
her of his home life. He was married and had a little boy, but was
separated from his wife because she had been unfaithful to him, and
now he hated her and used to send her forty roubles a month for the
maintenance of their son. And hearing of all this, Olenka sighed
and shook her head. She was sorry for him.


"Well, God keep you," she used to say to him at parting, as she
lighted him down the stairs with a candle. "Thank you for coming
to cheer me up, and may the Mother of God give you health."


And she always expressed herself with the same sedateness and
dignity, the same reasonableness, in imitation of her husband. As
the veterinary surgeon was disappearing behind the door below, she
would say:


"You know, Vladimir Platonitch, you'd better make it up with your
wife. You should forgive her for the sake of your son. You may be
sure the little fellow understands."


And when Pustovalov came back, she told him in a low voice about
the veterinary surgeon and his unhappy home life, and both sighed
and shook their heads and talked about the boy, who, no doubt,
missed his father, and by some strange connection of ideas, they
went up to the holy ikons, bowed to the ground before them and
prayed that God would give them children.


And so the Pustovalovs lived for six years quietly and peaceably
in love and complete harmony.


But behold! one winter day after drinking hot tea in the office,
Vassily Andreitch went out into the yard without his cap on to see
about sending off some timber, caught cold and was taken ill. He
had the best doctors, but he grew worse and died after four months'
illness. And Olenka was a widow once more.


"I've nobody, now you've left me, my darling," she sobbed, after
her husband's funeral. "How can I live without you, in wretchedness
and misery! Pity me, good people, all alone in the world!"


She went about dressed in black with long "weepers," and gave up
wearing hat and gloves for good. She hardly ever went out, except
to church, or to her husband's grave, and led the life of a nun.
It was not till six months later that she took off the weepers and
opened the shutters of the windows. She was sometimes seen in the
mornings, going with her cook to market for provisions, but what
went on in her house and how she lived now could only be surmised.
People guessed, from seeing her drinking tea in her garden with the
veterinary surgeon, who read the newspaper aloud to her, and from
the fact that, meeting a lady she knew at the post-office, she said
to her:


"There is no proper veterinary inspection in our town, and that's
the cause of all sorts of epidemics. One is always hearing of
people's getting infection from the milk supply, or catching diseases
from horses and cows. The health of domestic animals ought to be
as well cared for as the health of human beings."


She repeated the veterinary surgeon's words, and was of the same
opinion as he about everything. It was evident that she could not
live a year without some attachment, and had found new happiness
in the lodge. In any one else this would have been censured, but
no one could think ill of Olenka; everything she did was so natural.
Neither she nor the veterinary surgeon said anything to other people
of the change in their relations, and tried, indeed, to conceal it,
but without success, for Olenka could not keep a secret. When he
had visitors, men serving in his regiment, and she poured out tea
or served the supper, she would begin talking of the cattle plague,
of the foot and mouth disease, and of the municipal slaughterhouses.
He was dreadfully embarrassed, and when the guests had gone, he
would seize her by the hand and hiss angrily:


"I've asked you before not to talk about what you don't understand.
When we veterinary surgeons are talking among ourselves, please
don't put your word in. It's really annoying."


And she would look at him with astonishment and dismay, and ask him
in alarm: "But, Voloditchka, what _am_ I to talk about?"


And with tears in her eyes she would embrace him, begging him not
to be angry, and they were both happy.


But this happiness did not last long. The veterinary surgeon departed,
departed for ever with his regiment, when it was transferred to a
distant place--to Siberia, it may be. And Olenka was left alone.


Now she was absolutely alone. Her father had long been dead, and
his armchair lay in the attic, covered with dust and lame of one
leg. She got thinner and plainer, and when people met her in the
street they did not look at her as they used to, and did not smile
to her; evidently her best years were over and left behind, and now
a new sort of life had begun for her, which did not bear thinking
about. In the evening Olenka sat in the porch, and heard the band
playing and the fireworks popping in the Tivoli, but now the sound
stirred no response. She looked into her yard without interest,
thought of nothing, wished for nothing, and afterwards, when night
came on she went to bed and dreamed of her empty yard. She ate and
drank as it were unwillingly.


And what was worst of all, she had no opinions of any sort. She saw
the objects about her and understood what she saw, but could not
form any opinion about them, and did not know what to talk about.
And how awful it is not to have any opinions! One sees a bottle,
for instance, or the rain, or a peasant driving in his cart, but
what the bottle is for, or the rain, or the peasant, and what is
the meaning of it, one can't say, and could not even for a thousand
roubles. When she had Kukin, or Pustovalov, or the veterinary
surgeon, Olenka could explain everything, and give her opinion about
anything you like, but now there was the same emptiness in her brain
and in her heart as there was in her yard outside. And it was as
harsh and as bitter as wormwood in the mouth.


Little by little the town grew in all directions. The road became
a street, and where the Tivoli and the timber-yard had been, there
were new turnings and houses. How rapidly time passes! Olenka's
house grew dingy, the roof got rusty, the shed sank on one side,
and the whole yard was overgrown with docks and stinging-nettles.
Olenka herself had grown plain and elderly; in summer she sat in
the porch, and her soul, as before, was empty and dreary and full
of bitterness. In winter she sat at her window and looked at the
snow. When she caught the scent of spring, or heard the chime of
the church bells, a sudden rush of memories from the past came over
her, there was a tender ache in her heart, and her eyes brimmed
over with tears; but this was only for a minute, and then came
emptiness again and the sense of the futility of life. The black
kitten, Briska, rubbed against her and purred softly, but Olenka
was not touched by these feline caresses. That was not what she
needed. She wanted a love that would absorb her whole being, her
whole soul and reason--that would give her ideas and an object
in life, and would warm her old blood. And she would shake the
kitten off her skirt and say with vexation:


"Get along; I don't want you!"


And so it was, day after day and year after year, and no joy, and
no opinions. Whatever Mavra, the cook, said she accepted.


One hot July day, towards evening, just as the cattle were being
driven away, and the whole yard was full of dust, some one suddenly
knocked at the gate. Olenka went to open it herself and was dumbfounded
when she looked out: she saw Smirnin, the veterinary surgeon,
grey-headed, and dressed as a civilian. She suddenly remembered
everything. She could not help crying and letting her head fall on
his breast without uttering a word, and in the violence of her
feeling she did not notice how they both walked into the house and
sat down to tea.


"My dear Vladimir Platonitch! What fate has brought you?" she
muttered, trembling with joy.


"I want to settle here for good, Olga Semyonovna," he told her. "I
have resigned my post, and have come to settle down and try my luck
on my own account. Besides, it's time for my boy to go to school.
He's a big boy. I am reconciled with my wife, you know."


"Where is she?' asked Olenka.


"She's at the hotel with the boy, and I'm looking for lodgings."


"Good gracious, my dear soul! Lodgings? Why not have my house? Why
shouldn't that suit you? Why, my goodness, I wouldn't take any
rent!" cried Olenka in a flutter, beginning to cry again. "You live
here, and the lodge will do nicely for me. Oh dear! how glad I am!"


Next day the roof was painted and the walls were whitewashed, and
Olenka, with her arms akimbo walked about the yard giving directions.
Her face was beaming with her old smile, and she was brisk and alert
as though she had waked from a long sleep. The veterinary's wife
arrived--a thin, plain lady, with short hair and a peevish
expression. With her was her little Sasha, a boy of ten, small for
his age, blue-eyed, chubby, with dimples in his cheeks. And scarcely
had the boy walked into the yard when he ran after the cat, and at
once there was the sound of his gay, joyous laugh.


"Is that your puss, auntie?" he asked Olenka. "When she has little
ones, do give us a kitten. Mamma is awfully afraid of mice."


Olenka talked to him, and gave him tea. Her heart warmed and there
was a sweet ache in her bosom, as though the boy had been her own
child. And when he sat at the table in the evening, going over his
lessons, she looked at him with deep tenderness and pity as she
murmured to herself:


"You pretty pet! . . . my precious! . . . Such a fair little thing,
and so clever."


"'An island is a piece of land which is entirely surrounded by
water,'" he read aloud.


"An island is a piece of land," she repeated, and this was the first
opinion to which she gave utterance with positive conviction after
so many years of silence and dearth of ideas.


Now she had opinions of her own, and at supper she talked to Sasha's
parents, saying how difficult the lessons were at the high schools,
but that yet the high school was better than a commercial one, since
with a high-school education all careers were open to one, such as
being a doctor or an engineer.


Sasha began going to the high school. His mother departed to Harkov
to her sister's and did not return; his father used to go off every
day to inspect cattle, and would often be away from home for three
days together, and it seemed to Olenka as though Sasha was entirely
abandoned, that he was not wanted at home, that he was being starved,
and she carried him off to her lodge and gave him a little room
there.


And for six months Sasha had lived in the lodge with her. Every
morning Olenka came into his bedroom and found him fast asleep,
sleeping noiselessly with his hand under his cheek. She was sorry
to wake him.


"Sashenka," she would say mournfully, "get up, darling. It's time
for school."


He would get up, dress and say his prayers, and then sit down to
breakfast, drink three glasses of tea, and eat two large cracknels
and a half a buttered roll. All this time he was hardly awake and
a little ill-humoured in consequence.


"You don't quite know your fable, Sashenka," Olenka would say,
looking at him as though he were about to set off on a long journey.
"What a lot of trouble I have with you! You must work and do your
best, darling, and obey your teachers."


"Oh, do leave me alone!" Sasha would say.


Then he would go down the street to school, a little figure, wearing
a big cap and carrying a satchel on his shoulder. Olenka would
follow him noiselessly.


"Sashenka!" she would call after him, and she would pop into his
hand a date or a caramel. When he reached the street where the
school was, he would feel ashamed of being followed by a tall, stout
woman, he would turn round and say:


"You'd better go home, auntie. I can go the rest of the way alone."


She would stand still and look after him fixedly till he had
disappeared at the school-gate.


Ah, how she loved him! Of her former attachments not one had been
so deep; never had her soul surrendered to any feeling so spontaneously,
so disinterestedly, and so joyously as now that her maternal instincts
were aroused. For this little boy with the dimple in his cheek and
the big school cap, she would have given her whole life, she would
have given it with joy and tears of tenderness. Why? Who can tell
why?


When she had seen the last of Sasha, she returned home, contented
and serene, brimming over with love; her face, which had grown
younger during the last six months, smiled and beamed; people meeting
her looked at her with pleasure.


"Good-morning, Olga Semyonovna, darling. How are you, darling?"


"The lessons at the high school are very difficult now," she would
relate at the market. "It's too much; in the first class yesterday
they gave him a fable to learn by heart, and a Latin translation
and a problem. You know it's too much for a little chap."


And she would begin talking about the teachers, the lessons, and
the school books, saying just what Sasha said.


At three o'clock they had dinner together: in the evening they
learned their lessons together and cried. When she put him to bed,
she would stay a long time making the Cross over him and murmuring
a prayer; then she would go to bed and dream of that far-away misty
future when Sasha would finish his studies and become a doctor or
an engineer, would have a big house of his own with horses and a
carriage, would get married and have children. . . . She would fall
asleep still thinking of the same thing, and tears would run down
her cheeks from her closed eyes, while the black cat lay purring
beside her: "Mrr, mrr, mrr."


Suddenly there would come a loud knock at the gate.


Olenka would wake up breathless with alarm, her heart throbbing.
Half a minute later would come another knock.


"It must be a telegram from Harkov," she would think, beginning to
tremble from head to foot. "Sasha's mother is sending for him from
Harkov. . . . Oh, mercy on us!"


She was in despair. Her head, her hands, and her feet would turn
chill, and she would feel that she was the most unhappy woman in
the world. But another minute would pass, voices would be heard:
it would turn out to be the veterinary surgeon coming home from the
club.


"Well, thank God!" she would think.


And gradually the load in her heart would pass off, and she would
feel at ease. She would go back to bed thinking of Sasha, who lay
sound asleep in the next room, sometimes crying out in his sleep:


"I'll give it you! Get away! Shut up!"




ARIADNE


ON the deck of a steamer sailing from Odessa to Sevastopol, a rather
good-looking gentleman, with a little round beard, came up to me
to smoke, and said:


"Notice those Germans sitting near the shelter? Whenever Germans
or Englishmen get together, they talk about the crops, the price
of wool, or their personal affairs. But for some reason or other
when we Russians get together we never discuss anything but women
and abstract subjects--but especially women."


This gentleman's face was familiar to me already. We had returned
from abroad the evening before in the same train, and at Volotchisk
when the luggage was being examined by the Customs, I saw him
standing with a lady, his travelling companion, before a perfect
mountain of trunks and baskets filled with ladies' clothes, and I
noticed how embarrassed and downcast he was when he had to pay duty
on some piece of silk frippery, and his companion protested and
threatened to make a complaint. Afterwards, on the way to Odessa,
I saw him carrying little pies and oranges to the ladies' compartment.


It was rather damp; the vessel swayed a little, and the ladies had
retired to their cabins.


The gentleman with the little round beard sat down beside me and
continued:


"Yes, when Russians come together they discuss nothing but abstract
subjects and women. We are so intellectual, so solemn, that we utter
nothing but truths and can discuss only questions of a lofty order.
The Russian actor does not know how to be funny; he acts with
profundity even in a farce. We're just the same: when we have got
to talk of trifles we treat them only from an exalted point of view.
It comes from a lack of boldness, sincerity, and simplicity. We
talk so often about women, I fancy, because we are dissatisfied.
We take too ideal a view of women, and make demands out of all
proportion with what reality can give us; we get something utterly
different from what we want, and the result is dissatisfaction,
shattered hopes, and inward suffering, and if any one is suffering,
he's bound to talk of it. It does not bore you to go on with this
conversation?


"No, not in the least."


"In that case, allow me to introduce myself," said my companion,
rising from his seat a little:


"Ivan Ilyitch Shamohin, a Moscow landowner of a sort. . . . You I
know very well."


He sat down and went on, looking at me with a genuine and friendly
expression:


"A mediocre philosopher, like Max Nordau, would explain these
incessant conversations about women as a form of erotic madness,
or would put it down to our having been slave-owners and so on; I
take quite a different view of it. I repeat, we are dissatisfied
because we are idealists. We want the creatures who bear us and our
children to be superior to us and to everything in the world. When
we are young we adore and poeticize those with whom we are in love:
love and happiness with us are synonyms. Among us in Russia marriage
without love is despised, sensuality is ridiculed and inspires
repulsion, and the greatest success is enjoyed by those tales and
novels in which women are beautiful, poetical, and exalted; and if
the Russian has been for years in ecstasies over Raphael's Madonna,
or is eager for the emancipation of women, I assure you there is
no affectation about it. But the trouble is that when we have been
married or been intimate with a woman for some two or three years,
we begin to feel deceived and disillusioned: we pair off with others,
and again--disappointment, again--repulsion, and in the long
run we become convinced that women are lying, trivial, fussy, unfair,
undeveloped, cruel--in fact, far from being superior, are
immeasurably inferior to us men. And in our dissatisfaction and
disappointment there is nothing left for us but to grumble and talk
about what we've been so cruelly deceived in."


While Shamohin was talking I noticed that the Russian language and
our Russian surroundings gave him great pleasure. This was probably
because he had been very homesick abroad. Though he praised the
Russians and ascribed to them a rare idealism, he did not disparage
foreigners, and that I put down to his credit. It could be seen,
too, that there was some uneasiness in his soul, that he wanted to
talk more of himself than of women, and that I was in for a long
story in the nature of a confession. And when we had asked for a
bottle of wine and had each of us drunk a glass, this was how he
did in fact begin:


"I remember in a novel of Weltmann's some one says, 'So that's the
story!' and some one else answers, 'No, that's not the story--
that's only the introduction to the story.' In the same way what
I've said so far is only the introduction; what I really want to
tell you is my own love story. Excuse me, I must ask you again; it
won't bore you to listen?"


I told him it would not, and he went on:


The scene of my story is laid in the Moscow province in one of its
northern districts. The scenery there, I must tell you, is exquisite.
Our homestead is on the high bank of a rapid stream, where the water
chatters noisily day and night: imagine a big old garden, neat
flower-beds, beehives, a kitchen-garden, and below it a river with
leafy willows, which, when there is a heavy dew on them, have a
lustreless look as though they had turned grey; and on the other
side a meadow, and beyond the meadow on the upland a terrible, dark
pine forest. In that forest delicious, reddish agarics grow in
endless profusion, and elks still live in its deepest recesses.
When I am nailed up in my coffin I believe I shall still dream of
those early mornings, you know, when the sun hurts your eyes: or
the wonderful spring evenings when the nightingales and the landrails
call in the garden and beyond the garden, and sounds of the harmonica
float across from the village, while they play the piano indoors
and the stream babbles . . . when there is such music, in fact,
that one wants at the same time to cry and to sing aloud.


We have not much arable land, but our pasture makes up for it, and
with the forest yields about two thousand roubles a year. I am the
only son of my father; we are both modest persons, and with my
father's pension that sum was amply sufficient for us.


The first three years after finishing at the university I spent in
the country, looking after the estate and constantly expecting to
be elected on some local assembly; but what was most important, I
was violently in love with an extraordinarily beautiful and fascinating
girl. She was the sister of our neighbour, Kotlovitch, a ruined
landowner who had on his estate pine-apples, marvellous peaches,
lightning conductors, a fountain in the courtyard, and at the same
time not a farthing in his pocket. He did nothing and knew how to
do nothing. He was as flabby as though he had been made of boiled
turnip; he used to doctor the peasants by homeopathy and was
interested in spiritualism. He was, however, a man of great delicacy
and mildness, and by no means a fool, but I have no fondness for
these gentlemen who converse with spirits and cure peasant women
by magnetism. In the first place, the ideas of people who are not
intellectually free are always in a muddle, and it's extremely
difficult to talk to them; and, secondly, they usually love no one,
and have nothing to do with women, and their mysticism has an
unpleasant effect on sensitive people. I did not care for his
appearance either. He was tall, stout, white-skinned, with a little
head, little shining eyes, and chubby white fingers. He did not
shake hands, but kneaded one's hands in his. And he was always
apologising. If he asked for anything it was "Excuse me"; if he
gave you anything it was "Excuse me" too.


As for his sister, she was a character out of a different opera. I
must explain that I had not been acquainted with the Kotlovitches
in my childhood and early youth, for my father had been a professor
at N., and we had for many years lived away. When I did make their
acquaintance the girl was twenty-two, had left school long before,
and had spent two or three years in Moscow with a wealthy aunt who
brought her out into society. When I was introduced and first had
to talk to her, what struck me most of all was her rare and beautiful
name--Ariadne. It suited her so wonderfully! She was a brunette,
very thin, very slender, supple, elegant, and extremely graceful,
with refined and exceedingly noble features. Her eyes were shining,
too, but her brother's shone with a cold sweetness, mawkish as
sugar-candy, while hers had the glow of youth, proud and beautiful.
She conquered me on the first day of our acquaintance, and indeed
it was inevitable. My first impression was so overwhelming that to
this day I cannot get rid of my illusions; I am still tempted to
imagine that nature had some grand, marvellous design when she
created that girl.


Ariadne's voice, her walk, her hat, even her footprints on the sandy
bank where she used to angle for gudgeon, filled me with delight
and a passionate hunger for life. I judged of her spiritual being
from her lovely face and lovely figure, and every word, every smile
of Ariadne's bewitched me, conquered me and forced me to believe
in the loftiness of her soul. She was friendly, ready to talk, gay
and simple in her manners. She had a poetic belief in God, made
poetic reflections about death, and there was such a wealth of
varying shades in her spiritual organisation that even her faults
seemed in her to carry with them peculiar, charming qualities.
Suppose she wanted a new horse and had no money--what did that
matter? Something might be sold or pawned, or if the steward swore
that nothing could possibly be sold or pawned, the iron roofs might
be torn off the lodges and taken to the factory, or at the very
busiest time the farm-horses might be driven to the market and sold
there for next to nothing. These unbridled desires reduced the whole
household to despair at times, but she expressed them with such
refinement that everything was forgiven her; all things were permitted
her as to a goddess or to CÃ¦sar's wife. My love was pathetic and
was soon noticed by every one--my father, the neighbours, and the
peasants--and they all sympathised with me. When I stood the
workmen vodka, they would bow and say: "May the Kotlovitch young
lady be your bride, please God!"


And Ariadne herself knew that I loved her. She would often ride
over on horseback or drive in the char-Ã -banc to see us, and would
spend whole days with me and my father. She made great friends with
the old man, and he even taught her to bicycle, which was his
favourite amusement.


I remember helping her to get on the bicycle one evening, and she
looked so lovely that I felt as though I were burning my hands when
I touched her. I shuddered with rapture, and when the two of them,
my old father and she, both looking so handsome and elegant, bicycled
side by side along the main road, a black horse ridden by the steward
dashed aside on meeting them, and it seemed to me that it dashed
aside because it too was overcome by her beauty. My love, my worship,
touched Ariadne and softened her; she had a passionate longing to
be captivated like me and to respond with the same love. It was so
poetical!


But she was incapable of really loving as I did, for she was cold
and already somewhat corrupted. There was a demon in her, whispering
to her day and night that she was enchanting, adorable; and, having
no definite idea for what object she was created, or for what purpose
life had been given her, she never pictured herself in the future
except as very wealthy and distinguished, she had visions of balls,
races, liveries, of sumptuous drawing-rooms, of a salon of her own,
and of a perfect swarm of counts, princes, ambassadors, celebrated
painters and artists, all of them adoring her and in ecstasies over
her beauty and her dresses. . . .


This thirst for personal success, and this continual concentration
of the mind in one direction, makes people cold, and Ariadne was
cold--to me, to nature, and to music. Meanwhile time was passing,
and still there were no ambassadors on the scene. Ariadne went on
living with her brother, the spiritualist: things went from bad to
worse, so that she had nothing to buy hats and dresses with, and
had to resort to all sorts of tricks and dodges to conceal her
poverty.


As luck would have it, a certain Prince Maktuev, a wealthy man but
an utterly insignificant person, had paid his addresses to her when
she was living at her aunt's in Moscow. She had refused him,
point-blank. But now she was fretted by the worm of repentance that
she had refused him; just as a peasant pouts with repulsion at a
mug of kvass with cockroaches in it but yet drinks it, so she frowned
disdainfully at the recollection of the prince, and yet she would
say to me: "Say what you like, there is something inexplicable,
fascinating, in a title. . . ."


She dreamed of a title, of a brilliant position, and at the same
time she did not want to let me go. However one may dream of
ambassadors one's heart is not a stone, and one has wistful feelings
for one's youth. Ariadne tried to fall in love, made a show of being
in love, and even swore that she loved me. But I am a highly strung
and sensitive man; when I am loved I feel it even at a distance,
without vows and assurances; at once I felt as it were a coldness
in the air, and when she talked to me of love, it seemed to me as
though I were listening to the singing of a metal nightingale.
Ariadne was herself aware that she was lacking in something. She
was vexed and more than once I saw her cry. Another time--can you
imagine it?--all of a sudden she embraced me and kissed me. It
happened in the evening on the river-bank, and I saw by her eyes
that she did not love me, but was embracing me from curiosity, to
test herself and to see what came of it. And I felt dreadful. I
took her hands and said to her in despair: "These caresses without
love cause me suffering!"


"What a queer fellow you are!" she said with annoyance, and walked
away.


Another year or two might have passed, and in all probability I
should have married her, and so my story would have ended, but fate
was pleased to arrange our romance differently. It happened that a
new personage appeared on our horizon. Ariadne's brother had a visit
from an old university friend called Mihail Ivanitch Lubkov, a
charming man of whom coachmen and footmen used to say: "An entertaining
gentleman." He was a man of medium height, lean and bald, with a
face like a good-natured bourgeois, not interesting, but pale and
presentable, with a stiff, well-kept moustache, with a neck like
gooseskin, and a big Adam's apple. He used to wear pince-nez on a
wide black ribbon, lisped, and could not pronounce either _r_ or
_l_. He was always in good spirits, everything amused him.


He had made an exceedingly foolish marriage at twenty, and had
acquired two houses in Moscow as part of his wife's dowry. He began
doing them up and building a bath-house, and was completely ruined.
Now his wife and four children lodged in Oriental Buildings in great
poverty, and he had to support them--and this amused him. He was
thirty-six and his wife was by now forty-two, and that, too, amused
him. His mother, a conceited, sulky personage, with aristocratic
pretensions, despised his wife and lived apart with a perfect
menagerie of cats and dogs, and he had to allow her seventy-five
roubles a month also; he was, too, a man of taste, liked lunching
at the Slavyansky Bazaar and dining at the Hermitage; he needed a
great deal of money, but his uncle only allowed him two thousand
roubles a year, which was not enough, and for days together he would
run about Moscow with his tongue out, as the saying is, looking for
some one to borrow from--and this, too, amused him. He had come
to Kotlovitch to find in the lap of nature, as he said, a rest from
family life. At dinner, at supper, and on our walks, he talked about
his wife, about his mother, about his creditors, about the bailiffs,
and laughed at them; he laughed at himself and assured us that,
thanks to his talent for borrowing, he had made a great number of
agreeable acquaintances. He laughed without ceasing and we laughed
too. Moreover, in his company we spent our time differently. I was
more inclined to quiet, so to say idyllic pleasures; I liked fishing,
evening walks, gathering mushrooms; Lubkov preferred picnics,
fireworks, hunting. He used to get up picnics three times a week,
and Ariadne, with an earnest and inspired face, used to write a
list of oysters, champagne, sweets, and used to send me into Moscow
to get them, without inquiring, of course, whether I had money. And
at the picnics there were toasts and laughter, and again mirthful
descriptions of how old his wife was, what fat lap-dogs his mother
had, and what charming people his creditors were.


Lubkov was fond of nature, but he regarded it as something long
familiar and at the same time, in reality, infinitely beneath himself
and created for his pleasure. He would sometimes stand still before
some magnificent landscape and say: "It would be nice to have tea
here."


One day, seeing Ariadne walking in the distance with a parasol, he
nodded towards her and said:


"She's thin, and that's what I like; I don't like fat women."


This made me wince. I asked him not to speak like that about women
before me. He looked at me in surprise and said:


"What is there amiss in my liking thin women and not caring for fat
ones?"


I made no answer. Afterwards, being in very good spirits and a
trifle elevated, he said:


"I've noticed Ariadne Grigoryevna likes you. I can't understand why
you don't go in and win."


His words made me feel uncomfortable, and with some embarrassment
I told him how I looked at love and women.


"I don't know," he sighed; "to my thinking, a woman's a woman and
a man's a man. Ariadne Grigoryevna may be poetical and exalted, as
you say, but it doesn't follow that she must be superior to the
laws of nature. You see for yourself that she has reached the age
when she must have a husband or a lover. I respect women as much
as you do, but I don't think certain relations exclude poetry.
Poetry's one thing and love is another. It's just the same as it
is in farming. The beauty of nature is one thing and the income
from your forests or fields is quite another."


When Ariadne and I were fishing, Lubkov would lie on the sand close
by and make fun of me, or lecture me on the conduct of life.


"I wonder, my dear sir, how you can live without a love affair,"
he would say. "You are young, handsome, interesting--in fact,
you're a man not to be sniffed at, yet you live like a monk. Och!
I can't stand these fellows who are old at twenty-eight! I'm nearly
ten years older than you are, and yet which of us is the younger?
Ariadne Grigoryevna, which?"


"You, of course," Ariadne answered him.


And when he was bored with our silence and the attention with which
we stared at our floats he went home, and she said, looking at me
angrily:


"You're really not a man, but a mush, God forgive me! A man ought
to be able to be carried away by his feelings, he ought to be able
to be mad, to make mistakes, to suffer! A woman will forgive you
audacity and insolence, but she will never forgive your reasonableness!"


She was angry in earnest, and went on:


"To succeed, a man must be resolute and bold. Lubkov is not so
handsome as you are, but he is more interesting. He will always
succeed with women because he's not like you; he's a man. . . ."


And there was actually a note of exasperation in her voice.


One day at supper she began saying, not addressing me, that if she
were a man she would not stagnate in the country, but would travel,
would spend the winter somewhere aboard--in Italy, for instance.
Oh, Italy! At this point my father unconsciously poured oil on the
flames; he began telling us at length about Italy, how splendid it
was there, the exquisite scenery, the museums. Ariadne suddenly
conceived a burning desire to go to Italy. She positively brought
her fist down on the table and her eyes flashed as she said: "I
must go!"


After that came conversations every day about Italy: how splendid
it would be in Italy--ah, Italy!--oh, Italy! And when Ariadne
looked at me over her shoulder, from her cold and obstinate expression
I saw that in her dreams she had already conquered Italy with all
its salons, celebrated foreigners and tourists, and there was no
holding her back now. I advised her to wait a little, to put off
her tour for a year or two, but she frowned disdainfully and said:


"You're as prudent as an old woman!"


Lubkov was in favour of the tour. He said it could be done very
cheaply, and he, too, would go to Italy and have a rest there from
family life.


I behaved, I confess, as naÃ¯vely as a schoolboy.


Not from jealousy, but from a foreboding of something terrible and
extraordinary, I tried as far as possible not to leave them alone
together, and they made fun of me. For instance, when I went in
they would pretend they had just been kissing one another, and so
on. But lo and behold, one fine morning, her plump, white-skinned
brother, the spiritualist, made his appearance and expressed his
desire to speak to me alone.


He was a man without will; in spite of his education and his delicacy
he could never resist reading another person's letter, if it lay
before him on the table. And now he admitted that he had by chance
read a letter of Lubkov's to Ariadne.


"From that letter I learned that she is very shortly going abroad.
My dear fellow, I am very much upset! Explain it to me for goodness'
sake. I can make nothing of it!"


As he said this he breathed hard, breathing straight in my face and
smelling of boiled beef.


"Excuse me for revealing the secret of this letter to you, but you
are Ariadne's friend, she respects you. Perhaps you know something
of it. She wants to go away, but with whom? Mr. Lubkov is proposing
to go with her. Excuse me, but this is very strange of Mr. Lubkov;
he is a married man, he has children, and yet he is making a
declaration of love; he is writing to Ariadne 'darling.' Excuse me,
but it is so strange!"


I turned cold all over; my hands and feet went numb and I felt an
ache in my chest, as if a three-cornered stone had been driven into
it. Kotlovitch sank helplessly into an easy-chair, and his hands
fell limply at his sides.


"What can I do?" I inquired.


"Persuade her. . . . Impress her mind. . . . Just consider, what
is Lubkov to her? Is he a match for her? Oh, good God! How awful
it is, how awful it is!" he went on, clutching his head. "She has
had such splendid offers--Prince Maktuev and . . . and others.
The prince adores her, and only last Wednesday week his late
grandfather, Ilarion, declared positively that Ariadne would be his
wife--positively! His grandfather Ilarion is dead, but he is a
wonderfully intelligent person; we call up his spirit every day."


After this conversation I lay awake all night and thought of shooting
myself. In the morning I wrote five letters and tore them all up.
Then I sobbed in the barn. Then I took a sum of money from my father
and set off for the Caucasus without saying good-bye.


Of course, a woman's a woman and a man's a man, but can all that
be as simple in our day as it was before the Flood, and can it be
that I, a cultivated man endowed with a complex spiritual organisation,
ought to explain the intense attraction I feel towards a woman
simply by the fact that her bodily formation is different from mine?
Oh, how awful that would be! I want to believe that in his struggle
with nature the genius of man has struggled with physical love too,
as with an enemy, and that, if he has not conquered it, he has at
least succeeded in tangling it in a net-work of illusions of
brotherhood and love; and for me, at any rate, it is no longer a
simple instinct of my animal nature as with a dog or a toad, but
is real love, and every embrace is spiritualised by a pure impulse
of the heart and respect for the woman. In reality, a disgust for
the animal instinct has been trained for ages in hundreds of
generations; it is inherited by me in my blood and forms part of
my nature, and if I poetize love, is not that as natural and
inevitable in our day as my ears' not being able to move and my not
being covered with fur? I fancy that's how the majority of civilised
people look at it, so that the absence of the moral, poetical element
in love is treated in these days as a phenomenon, as a sign of
atavism; they say it is a symptom of degeneracy, of many forms of
insanity. It is true that, in poetizing love, we assume in those
we love qualities that are lacking in them, and that is a source
of continual mistakes and continual miseries for us. But to my
thinking it is better, even so; that is, it is better to suffer
than to find complacency on the basis of woman being woman and man
being man.


In Tiflis I received a letter from my father. He wrote that Ariadne
Grigoryevna had on such a day gone abroad, intending to spend the
whole winter away. A month later I returned home. It was by now
autumn. Every week Ariadne sent my father extremely interesting
letters on scented paper, written in an excellent literary style.
It is my opinion that every woman can be a writer. Ariadne described
in great detail how it had not been easy for her to make it up with
her aunt and induce the latter to give her a thousand roubles for
the journey, and what a long time she had spent in Moscow trying
to find an old lady, a distant relation, in order to persuade her
to go with her. Such a profusion of detail suggested fiction, and
I realised, of course, that she had no chaperon with her.


Soon afterwards I, too, had a letter from her, also scented and
literary. She wrote that she had missed me, missed my beautiful,
intelligent, loving eyes. She reproached me affectionately for
wasting my youth, for stagnating in the country when I might, like
her, be living in paradise under the palms, breathing the fragrance
of the orange-trees. And she signed herself "Your forsaken Ariadne."
Two days later came another letter in the same style, signed "Your
forgotten Ariadne." My mind was confused. I loved her passionately,
I dreamed of her every night, and then this "your forsaken," "your
forgotten"--what did it mean? What was it for? And then the
dreariness of the country, the long evenings, the disquieting
thoughts of Lubkov. . . . The uncertainty tortured me, and poisoned
my days and nights; it became unendurable. I could not bear it and
went abroad.


Ariadne summoned me to Abbazzia. I arrived there on a bright warm
day after rain; the rain-drops were still hanging on the trees and
glistening on the huge, barrack-like dÃ©pendance where Ariadne and
Lubkov were living.


They were not at home. I went into the park; wandered about the
avenues, then sat down. An Austrian General, with his hands behind
him, walked past me, with red stripes on his trousers such as our
generals wear. A baby was wheeled by in a perambulator and the
wheels squeaked on the damp sand. A decrepit old man with jaundice
passed, then a crowd of Englishwomen, a Catholic priest, then the
Austrian General again. A military band, only just arrived from
Fiume, with glittering brass instruments, sauntered by to the
bandstand--they began playing.


Have you ever been at Abbazzia? It's a filthy little Slav town with
only one street, which stinks, and in which one can't walk after
rain without goloshes. I had read so much and always with such
intense feeling about this earthly paradise that when afterwards,
holding up my trousers, I cautiously crossed the narrow street, and
in my ennui bought some hard pears from an old peasant woman who,
recognising me as a Russian, said: "Tcheeteery" for "tchetyry"
(four)--"davadtsat" for "dvadtsat" (twenty), and when I wondered
in perplexity where to go and what to do here, and when I inevitably
met Russians as disappointed as I was, I began to feel vexed and
ashamed. There is a calm bay there full of steamers and boats with
coloured sails. From there I could see Fiume and the distant islands
covered with lilac mist, and it would have been picturesque if the
view over the bay had not been hemmed in by the hotels and their
dÃ©pendances--buildings in an absurd, trivial style of architecture,
with which the whole of that green shore has been covered by greedy
money grubbers, so that for the most part you see nothing in this
little paradise but windows, terraces, and little squares with
tables and waiters' black coats. There is a park such as you find
now in every watering-place abroad. And the dark, motionless, silent
foliage of the palms, and the bright yellow sand in the avenue, and
the bright green seats, and the glitter of the braying military
horns--all this sickened me in ten minutes! And yet one is obliged
for some reason to spend ten days, ten weeks, there!


Having been dragged reluctantly from one of these watering-places
to another, I have been more and more struck by the inconvenient
and niggardly life led by the wealthy and well-fed, the dulness and
feebleness of their imagination, the lack of boldness in their
tastes and desires. And how much happier are those tourists, old
and young, who, not having the money to stay in hotels, live where
they can, admire the view of the sea from the tops of the mountains,
lying on the green grass, walk instead of riding, see the forests
and villages at close quarters, observe the customs of the country,
listen to its songs, fall in love with its women. . . .


While I was sitting in the park, it began to get dark, and in the
twilight my Ariadne appeared, elegant and dressed like a princess;
after her walked Lubkov, wearing a new loose-fitting suit, bought
probably in Vienna.


"Why are you cross with me?" he was saying. "What have I done to
you?"


Seeing me, she uttered a cry of joy, and probably, if we had not
been in the park, would have thrown herself on my neck. She pressed
my hands warmly and laughed; and I laughed too and almost cried
with emotion. Questions followed, of the village, of my father,
whether I had seen her brother, and so on. She insisted on my looking
her straight in the face, and asked if I remembered the gudgeon,
our little quarrels, the picnics. . . .


"How nice it all was really!" she sighed. "But we're not having a
slow time here either. We have a great many acquaintances, my dear,
my best of friends! To-morrow I will introduce you to a Russian
family here, but please buy yourself another hat." She scrutinised
me and frowned. "Abbazzia is not the country," she said; "here one
must be _comme il faut_."


Then we went to the restaurant. Ariadne was laughing and mischievous
all the time; she kept calling me "dear," "good," "clever," and
seemed as though she could not believe her eyes that I was with
her. We sat on till eleven o'clock, and parted very well satisfied
both with the supper and with each other.


Next day Ariadne presented me to the Russian family as: "The son
of a distinguished professor whose estate is next to ours."


She talked to this family about nothing but estates and crops, and
kept appealing to me. She wanted to appear to be a very wealthy
landowner, and did, in fact, succeed in doing so. Her manner was
superb like that of a real aristocrat, which indeed she was by
birth.


"But what a person my aunt is!" she said suddenly, looking at me
with a smile. "We had a slight tiff, and she has bolted off to
Meran. What do you say to that?"


Afterwards when we were walking in the park I asked her:


"What aunt were you talking of just now? What aunt is that?"


"That was a saving lie," laughed Ariadne. "They must not know I'm
without a chaperon."


After a moment's silence she came closer to me and said:


"My dear, my dear, do be friends with Lubkov. He is so unhappy! His
wife and mother are simply awful."


She used the formal mode of address in speaking to Lubkov, and when
she was going up to bed she said good-night to him exactly as she
did to me, and their rooms were on different floors. All this made
me hope that it was all nonsense, and that there was no sort of
love affair between them, and I felt at ease when I met him. And
when one day he asked me for the loan of three hundred roubles, I
gave it to him with the greatest pleasure.


Every day we spent in enjoying ourselves and in nothing but enjoying
ourselves; we strolled in the park, we ate, we drank. Every day
there were conversations with the Russian family. By degrees I got
used to the fact that if I went into the park I should be sure to
meet the old man with jaundice, the Catholic priest, and the Austrian
General, who always carried a pack of little cards, and wherever
it was possible sat down and played patience, nervously twitching
his shoulders. And the band played the same thing over and over
again.


At home in the country I used to feel ashamed to meet the peasants
when I was fishing or on a picnic party on a working day; here too
I was ashamed at the sight of the footmen, the coachmen, and the
workmen who met us. It always seemed to me they were looking at me
and thinking: "Why are you doing nothing?" And I was conscious of
this feeling of shame every day from morning to night. It was a
strange, unpleasant, monotonous time; it was only varied by Lubkov's
borrowing from me now a hundred, now fifty guldens, and being
suddenly revived by the money as a morphia-maniac is by morphia,
beginning to laugh loudly at his wife, at himself, at his creditors.


At last it began to be rainy and cold. We went to Italy, and I
telegraphed to my father begging him for mercy's sake to send me
eight hundred roubles to Rome. We stayed in Venice, in Bologna, in
Florence, and in every town invariably put up at an expensive hotel,
where we were charged separately for lights, and for service, and
for heating, and for bread at lunch, and for the right of having
dinner by ourselves. We ate enormously. In the morning they gave
us _cafÃ© complet_; at one o'clock lunch: meat, fish, some sort of
omelette, cheese, fruits, and wine. At six o'clock dinner of eight
courses with long intervals, during which we drank beer and wine.
At nine o'clock tea. At midnight Ariadne would declare she was
hungry, and ask for ham and boiled eggs. We would eat to keep her
company.


In the intervals between meals we used to rush about the museums
and exhibitions in continual anxiety for fear we should be late for
dinner or lunch. I was bored at the sight of the pictures; I longed
to be at home to rest; I was exhausted, looked about for a chair
and hypocritically repeated after other people: "How exquisite,
what atmosphere!" Like overfed boa constrictors, we noticed only
the most glaring objects. The shop windows hypnotised us; we went
into ecstasies over imitation brooches and bought a mass of useless
trumpery.


The same thing happened in Rome, where it rained and there was a
cold wind. After a heavy lunch we went to look at St. Peter's, and
thanks to our replete condition and perhaps the bad weather, it
made no sort of impression on us, and detecting in each other an
indifference to art, we almost quarrelled.


The money came from my father. I went to get it, I remember, in the
morning. Lubkov went with me.


"The present cannot be full and happy when one has a past," said
he. "I have heavy burdens left on me by the past. However, if only
I get the money, it's no great matter, but if not, I'm in a fix.
Would you believe it, I have only eight francs left, yet I must
send my wife a hundred and my mother another. And we must live here
too. Ariadne's like a child; she won't enter into the position, and
flings away money like a duchess. Why did she buy a watch yesterday?
And, tell me, what object is there in our going on playing at being
good children? Why, our hiding our relations from the servants and
our friends costs us from ten to fifteen francs a day, as I have
to have a separate room. What's the object of it?"


I felt as though a sharp stone had been turned round in my chest.
There was no uncertainty now; it was all clear to me. I turned cold
all over, and at once made a resolution to give up seeing them, to
run away from them, to go home at once. . . .


"To get on terms with a woman is easy enough," Lubkov went on. "You
have only to undress her; but afterwards what a bore it is, what a
silly business!"


When I counted over the money I received he said:


"If you don't lend me a thousand francs, I am faced with complete
ruin. Your money is the only resource left to me."


I gave him the money, and he at once revived and began laughing
about his uncle, a queer fish, who could never keep his address
secret from his wife. When I reached the hotel I packed and paid
my bill. I had still to say good-bye to Ariadne.


I knocked at the door.


"Entrez!"


In her room was the usual morning disorder: tea-things on the table,
an unfinished roll, an eggshell; a strong overpowering reek of
scent. The bed had not been made, and it was evident that two had
slept in it.


Ariadne herself had only just got out of bed and was now with her
hair down in a flannel dressing-jacket.


I said good-morning to her, and then sat in silence for a minute
while she tried to put her hair tidy, and then I asked her, trembling
all over:


"Why . . . why . . . did you send for me here?"


Evidently she guessed what I was thinking; she took me by the hand
and said:


"I want you to be here, you are so pure."


I felt ashamed of my emotion, of my trembling. And I was afraid I
might begin sobbing, too! I went out without saying another word,
and within an hour I was sitting in the train. All the journey, for
some reason, I imagined Ariadne with child, and she seemed disgusting
to me, and all the women I saw in the trains and at the stations
looked to me, for some reason, as if they too were with child, and
they too seemed disgusting and pitiable. I was in the position of
a greedy, passionate miser who should suddenly discover that all
his gold coins were false. The pure, gracious images which my
imagination, warmed by love, had cherished for so long, my plans,
my hopes, my memories, my ideas of love and of woman--all now
were jeering and putting out their tongues at me. "Ariadne," I kept
asking with horror, "that young, intellectual, extraordinarily
beautiful girl, the daughter of a senator, carrying on an intrigue
with such an ordinary, uninteresting vulgarian? But why should she
not love Lubkov?" I answered myself. "In what is he inferior to me?
Oh, let her love any one she likes, but why lie to me? But why is
she bound to be open with me?" And so I went on over and over again
till I was stupefied.


It was cold in the train; I was travelling first class, but even
so there were three on a side, there were no double windows, the
outer door opened straight into the compartment, and I felt as
though I were in the stocks, cramped, abandoned, pitiful, and my
legs were fearfully numb, and at the same time I kept recalling how
fascinating she had been that morning in her dressing-jacket and
with her hair down, and I was suddenly overcome by such acute
jealousy that I leapt up in anguish, so that my neighbours stared
at me in wonder and positive alarm.


At home I found deep snow and twenty degrees of frost. I'm fond of
the winter; I'm fond of it because at that time, even in the hardest
frosts, it's particularly snug at home. It's pleasant to put on
one's fur jacket and felt overboots on a clear frosty day, to do
something in the garden or in the yard, or to read in a well warmed
room, to sit in my father's study before the open fire, to wash in
my country bath-house. . . . Only if there is no mother in the
house, no sister and no children, it is somehow dreary on winter
evenings, and they seem extraordinarily long and quiet. And the
warmer and snugger it is, the more acutely is this lack felt. In
the winter when I came back from abroad, the evenings were endlessly
long, I was intensely depressed, so depressed that I could not even
read; in the daytime I was coming and going, clearing away the snow
in the garden or feeding the chickens and the calves, but in the
evening it was all up with me.


I had never cared for visitors before, but now I was glad of them,
for I knew there was sure to be talk of Ariadne. Kotlovitch, the
spiritualist, used often to come to talk about his sister, and
sometimes he brought with him his friend Prince Maktuev, who was
as much in love with Ariadne as I was. To sit in Ariadne's room,
to finger the keys of her piano, to look at her music was a necessity
for the prince--he could not live without it; and the spirit of
his grandfather Ilarion was still predicting that sooner or later
she would be his wife. The prince usually stayed a long time with
us, from lunch to midnight, saying nothing all the time; in silence
he would drink two or three bottles of beer, and from time to time,
to show that he too was taking part in the conversation, he would
laugh an abrupt, melancholy, foolish laugh. Before going home he
would always take me aside and ask me in an undertone: "When did
you see Ariadne Grigoryevna last? Was she quite well? I suppose
she's not tired of being out there?"


Spring came on. There was the harrowing to do and then the sowing
of spring corn and clover. I was sad, but there was the feeling of
spring. One longed to accept the inevitable. Working in the fields
and listening to the larks, I asked myself: "Couldn't I have done
with this question of personal happiness once and for all? Couldn't
I lay aside my fancy and marry a simple peasant girl?"


Suddenly when we were at our very busiest, I got a letter with the
Italian stamp, and the clover and the beehives and the calves and
the peasant girl all floated away like smoke. This time Ariadne
wrote that she was profoundly, infinitely unhappy. She reproached
me for not holding out a helping hand to her, for looking down upon
her from the heights of my virtue and deserting her at the moment
of danger. All this was written in a large, nervous handwriting
with blots and smudges, and it was evident that she wrote in haste
and distress. In conclusion she besought me to come and save her.
Again my anchor was hauled up and I was carried away. Ariadne was
in Rome. I arrived late in the evening, and when she saw me, she
sobbed and threw herself on my neck. She had not changed at all
that winter, and was just as young and charming. We had supper
together and afterwards drove about Rome until dawn, and all the
time she kept telling me about her doings. I asked where Lubkov
was.


"Don't remind me of that creature!" she cried. "He is loathsome and
disgusting to me!"


"But I thought you loved him," I said.


"Never," she said. "At first he struck me as original and aroused
my pity, that was all. He is insolent and takes a woman by storm.
And that's attractive. But we won't talk about him. That is a
melancholy page in my life. He has gone to Russia to get money.
Serve him right! I told him not to dare to come back."


She was living then, not at an hotel, but in a private lodging of
two rooms which she had decorated in her own taste, frigidly and
luxuriously.


After Lubkov had gone away she had borrowed from her acquaintances
about five thousand francs, and my arrival certainly was the one
salvation for her.


I had reckoned on taking her back to the country, but I did not
succeed in that. She was homesick for her native place, but her
recollections of the poverty she had been through there, of privations,
of the rusty roof on her brother's house, roused a shudder of
disgust, and when I suggested going home to her, she squeezed my
hands convulsively and said:


"No, no, I shall die of boredom there!"


Then my love entered upon its final phase.


"Be the darling that you used to be; love me a little," said Ariadne,
bending over to me. "You're sulky and prudent, you're afraid to
yield to impulse, and keep thinking of consequences, and that's
dull. Come, I beg you, I beseech you, be nice to me! . . . My pure
one, my holy one, my dear one, I love you so!"


I became her lover. For a month anyway I was like a madman, conscious
of nothing but rapture. To hold in one's arms a young and lovely
body, with bliss to feel her warmth every time one waked up from
sleep, and to remember that she was there--she, my Ariadne!--
oh, it was not easy to get used to that! But yet I did get used to
it, and by degrees became capable of reflecting on my new position.
First of all, I realised, as before, that Ariadne did not love me.
But she wanted to be really in love, she was afraid of solitude,
and, above all, I was healthy, young, vigorous; she was sensual,
like all cold people, as a rule--and we both made a show of being
united by a passionate, mutual love. Afterwards I realised something
else, too.


We stayed in Rome, in Naples, in Florence; we went to Paris, but
there we thought it cold and went back to Italy. We introduced
ourselves everywhere as husband and wife, wealthy landowners. People
readily made our acquaintance and Ariadne had great social success
everywhere. As she took lessons in painting, she was called an
artist, and only imagine, that quite suited her, though she had not
the slightest trace of talent.


She would sleep every day till two or three o'clock; she had her
coffee and lunch in bed. At dinner she would eat soup, lobster,
fish, meat, asparagus, game, and after she had gone to bed I used
to bring up something, for instance roast beef, and she would eat
it with a melancholy, careworn expression, and if she waked in the
night she would eat apples and oranges.


The chief, so to say fundamental, characteristic of the woman was
an amazing duplicity. She was continually deceitful every minute,
apparently apart from any necessity, as it were by instinct, by an
impulse such as makes the sparrow chirrup and the cockroach waggle
its antennÃ¦. She was deceitful with me, with the footman, with the
porter, with the tradesmen in the shops, with her acquaintances;
not one conversation, not one meeting, took place without affectation
and pretence. A man had only to come into our room--whoever it
might be, a waiter, or a baron--for her eyes, her expression, her
voice to change, even the contour of her figure was transformed.
At the very first glance at her then, you would have said there
were no more wealthy and fashionable people in Italy than we. She
never met an artist or a musician without telling him all sorts of
lies about his remarkable talent.


"You have such a talent!" she would say, in honeyed cadences, "I'm
really afraid of you. I think you must see right through people."


And all this simply in order to please, to be successful, to be
fascinating! She waked up every morning with the one thought of
"pleasing"! It was the aim and object of her life. If I had told
her that in such a house, in such a street, there lived a man who
was not attracted by her, it would have caused her real suffering.
She wanted every day to enchant, to captivate, to drive men crazy.
The fact that I was in her power and reduced to a complete nonentity
before her charms gave her the same sort of satisfaction that
visitors used to feel in tournaments. My subjection was not enough,
and at nights, stretched out like a tigress, uncovered--she was
always too hot--she would read the letters sent her by Lubkov;
he besought her to return to Russia, vowing if she did not he would
rob or murder some one to get the money to come to her. She hated
him, but his passionate, slavish letters excited her. She had an
extraordinary opinion of her own charms; she imagined that if
somewhere, in some great assembly, men could have seen how beautifully
she was made and the colour of her skin, she would have vanquished
all Italy, the whole world. Her talk of her figure, of her skin,
offended me, and observing this, she would, when she was angry, to
vex me, say all sorts of vulgar things, taunting me. One day when
we were at the summer villa of a lady of our acquaintance, and she
lost her temper, she even went so far as to say: "If you don't leave
off boring me with your sermons, I'll undress this minute and lie
naked here on these flowers."


Often looking at her asleep, or eating, or trying to assume a naÃ¯ve
expression, I wondered why that extraordinary beauty, grace, and
intelligence had been given her by God. Could it simply be for
lolling in bed, eating and lying, lying endlessly? And was she
intelligent really? She was afraid of three candles in a row, of
the number thirteen, was terrified of spells and bad dreams. She
argued about free love and freedom in general like a bigoted old
woman, declared that Boleslav Markevitch was a better writer than
Turgenev. But she was diabolically cunning and sharp, and knew how
to seem a highly educated, advanced person in company.


Even at a good-humoured moment, she could always insult a servant
or kill an insect without a pang; she liked bull-fights, liked to
read about murders, and was angry when prisoners were acquitted.


For the life Ariadne and I were leading, we had to have a great
deal of money. My poor father sent me his pension, all the little
sums he received, borrowed for me wherever he could, and when one
day he answered me: "Non habeo," I sent him a desperate telegram
in which I besought him to mortgage the estate. A little later I
begged him to get money somehow on a second mortgage. He did this
too without a murmur and sent me every farthing. Ariadne despised
the practical side of life; all this was no concern of hers, and
when flinging away thousands of francs to satisfy her mad desires
I groaned like an old tree, she would be singing "Addio bella Napoli"
with a light heart.


Little by little I grew cold to her and began to be ashamed of our
tie. I am not fond of pregnancy and confinements, but now I sometimes
dreamed of a child who would have been at least a formal justification
of our life. That I might not be completely disgusted with myself,
I began reading and visiting museums and galleries, gave up drinking
and took to eating very little. If one keeps oneself well in hand
from morning to night, one's heart seems lighter. I began to bore
Ariadne too. The people with whom she won her triumphs were, by the
way, all of the middling sort; as before, there were no ambassadors,
there was no salon, the money did not run to it, and this mortified
her and made her sob, and she announced to me at last that perhaps
she would not be against our returning to Russia.


And here we are on our way. For the last few months she has been
zealously corresponding with her brother; she evidently has some
secret projects, but what they are--God knows! I am sick of trying
to fathom her underhand schemes! But we're going, not to the country,
but to Yalta and afterwards to the Caucasus. She can only exist now
at watering-places, and if you knew how I hate all these watering-places,
how suffocated and ashamed I am in them. If I could be in the country
now! If I could only be working now, earning my bread by the sweat
of my brow, atoning for my follies. I am conscious of a superabundance
of energy and I believe that if I were to put that energy to work
I could redeem my estate in five years. But now, as you see, there
is a complication. Here we're not abroad, but in mother Russia; we
shall have to think of lawful wedlock. Of course, all attraction
is over; there is no trace left of my old love, but, however that
may be, I am bound in honour to marry her.


----


Shamohin, excited by his story, went below with me and we continued
talking about women. It was late. It appeared that he and I were
in the same cabin.


"So far it is only in the village that woman has not fallen behind
man," said Shamohin. "There she thinks and feels just as man does,
and struggles with nature in the name of culture as zealously as
he. In the towns the woman of the bourgeois or intellectual class
has long since fallen behind, and is returning to her primitive
condition. She is half a human beast already, and, thanks to her,
a great deal of what had been won by human genius has been lost
again; the woman gradually disappears and in her place is the
primitive female. This dropping-back on the part of the educated
woman is a real danger to culture; in her retrogressive movement
she tries to drag man after her and prevents him from moving forward.
That is incontestable."


I asked: "Why generalise? Why judge of all women from Ariadne alone?
The very struggle of women for education and sexual equality, which
I look upon as a struggle for justice, precludes any hypothesis of
a retrograde movement."


But Shamohin scarcely listened to me and he smiled distrustfully.
He was a passionate, convinced misogynist, and it was impossible
to alter his convictions.


"Oh, nonsense!" he interrupted. "When once a woman sees in me, not
a man, not an equal, but a male, and her one anxiety all her life
is to attract me--that is, to take possession of me--how can
one talk of their rights? Oh, don't you believe them; they are very,
very cunning! We men make a great stir about their emancipation,
but they don't care about their emancipation at all, they only
pretend to care about it; they are horribly cunning things, horribly
cunning!"


I began to feel sleepy and weary of discussion. I turned over with
my face to the wall.


"Yes," I heard as I fell asleep--"yes, and it's our education
that's at fault, sir. In our towns, the whole education and bringing
up of women in its essence tends to develop her into the human beast
--that is, to make her attractive to the male and able to vanquish
him. Yes, indeed"--Shamohiri sighed--"little girls ought to be
taught and brought up with boys, so that they might be always
together. A woman ought to be trained so that she may be able, like
a man, to recognise when she's wrong, or she always thinks she's
in the right. Instil into a little girl from her cradle that a man
is not first of all a cavalier or a possible lover, but her neighbour,
her equal in everything. Train her to think logically, to generalise,
and do not assure her that her brain weighs less than a man's and
that therefore she can be indifferent to the sciences, to the arts,
to the tasks of culture in general. The apprentice to the shoemaker
or the house painter has a brain of smaller size than the grown-up
man too, yet he works, suffers, takes his part in the general
struggle for existence. We must give up our attitude to the
physiological aspect, too--to pregnancy and childbirth, seeing
that in the first place women don't have babies every month; secondly,
not all women have babies; and, thirdly, a normal countrywoman works
in the fields up to the day of her confinement and it does her no
harm. Then there ought to be absolute equality in everyday life.
If a man gives a lady his chair or picks up the handkerchief she
has dropped, let her repay him in the same way. I have no objection
if a girl of good family helps me to put on my coat or hands me a
glass of water--"


I heard no more, for I fell asleep.


Next morning when we were approaching Sevastopol, it was damp,
unpleasant weather; the ship rocked. Shamohin sat on deck with me,
brooding and silent. When the bell rang for tea, men with their
coat-collars turned up and ladies with pale, sleepy faces began
going below; a young and very beautiful lady, the one who had been
so angry with the Customs officers at Volotchisk, stopped before
Shamohin and said with the expression of a naughty, fretful child:


"Jean, your birdie's been sea-sick."


Afterwards when I was at Yalta I saw the same beautiful lady dashing
about on horseback with a couple of officers hardly able to keep
up with her. And one morning I saw her in an overall and a Phrygian
cap, sketching on the sea-front with a great crowd admiring her a
little way off. I too was introduced to her. She pressed my hand
with great warmth, and looking at me ecstatically, thanked me in
honeyed cadences for the pleasure I had given her by my writings.


"Don't you believe her," Shamohin whispered to me, "she has never
read a word of them."


When I was walking on the sea-front in the early evening Shamohin
met me with his arms full of big parcels of fruits and dainties.


"Prince Maktuev is here!" he said joyfully. "He came yesterday with
her brother, the spiritualist! Now I understand what she was writing
to him about! Oh, Lord!" he went on, gazing up to heaven, and
pressing his parcels to his bosom. "If she hits it off with the
prince, it means freedom, then I can go back to the country with
my father!"


And he ran on.


"I begin to believe in spirits," he called to me, looking back.
"The spirit of grandfather Ilarion seems to have prophesied the
truth! Oh, if only it is so!"


----


The day after this meeting I left Yalta and how Shamohin's story
ended I don't know.




POLINKA


IT is one o'clock in the afternoon. Shopping is at its height at
the "NouveautÃ©'s de Paris," a drapery establishment in one of the
Arcades. There is a monotonous hum of shopmen's voices, the hum one
hears at school when the teacher sets the boys to learn something
by heart. This regular sound is not interrupted by the laughter of
lady customers nor the slam of the glass door, nor the scurrying
of the boys.


Polinka, a thin fair little person whose mother is the head of a
dressmaking establishment, is standing in the middle of the shop
looking about for some one. A dark-browed boy runs up to her and
asks, looking at her very gravely:


"What is your pleasure, madam?"


"Nikolay Timofeitch always takes my order," answers Polinka.


Nikolay Timofeitch, a graceful dark young man, fashionably dressed,
with frizzled hair and a big pin in his cravat, has already cleared
a place on the counter and is craning forward, looking at Polinka
with a smile.


"Morning, Pelagea Sergeevna!" he cries in a pleasant, hearty baritone
voice. "What can I do for you?"


"Good-morning!" says Polinka, going up to him. "You see, I'm back
again. . . . Show me some gimp, please."


"Gimp--for what purpose?"


"For a bodice trimming--to trim a whole dress, in fact."


"Certainly."


Nickolay Timofeitch lays several kinds of gimp before Polinka; she
looks at the trimmings languidly and begins bargaining over them.


"Oh, come, a rouble's not dear," says the shopman persuasively,
with a condescending smile. "It's a French trimming, pure silk. . . .
We have a commoner sort, if you like, heavier. That's forty-five
kopecks a yard; of course, it's nothing like the same quality."


"I want a bead corselet, too, with gimp buttons," says Polinka,
bending over the gimp and sighing for some reason. "And have you
any bead motifs to match?"


"Yes."


Polinka bends still lower over the counter and asks softly:


"And why did you leave us so early on Thursday, Nikolay Timofeitch?"


"Hm! It's queer you noticed it," says the shopman, with a smirk.
"You were so taken up with that fine student that . . . it's queer
you noticed it!"


Polinka flushes crimson and remains mute. With a nervous quiver in
his fingers the shopman closes the boxes, and for no sort of object
piles them one on the top of another. A moment of silence follows.


"I want some bead lace, too," says Polinka, lifting her eyes guiltily
to the shopman.


"What sort? Black or coloured? Bead lace on tulle is the most
fashionable trimming."


"And how much is it?"


"The black's from eighty kopecks and the coloured from two and a
half roubles. I shall never come and see you again," Nikolay
Timofeitch adds in an undertone.


"Why?"


"Why? It's very simple. You must understand that yourself. Why
should I distress myself? It's a queer business! Do you suppose
it's a pleasure to me to see that student carrying on with you? I
see it all and I understand. Ever since autumn he's been hanging
about you and you go for a walk with him almost every day; and when
he is with you, you gaze at him as though he were an angel. You are
in love with him; there's no one to beat him in your eyes. Well,
all right, then, it's no good talking."


Polinka remains dumb and moves her finger on the counter in
embarrassment.


"I see it all," the shopman goes on. "What inducement have I to
come and see you? I've got some pride. It's not every one likes to
play gooseberry. What was it you asked for?"


"Mamma told me to get a lot of things, but I've forgotten. I want
some feather trimming too."


"What kind would you like?"


"The best, something fashionable."


"The most fashionable now are real bird feathers. If you want the
most fashionable colour, it's heliotrope or _kanak_--that is,
claret with a yellow shade in it. We have an immense choice. And
what all this affair is going to lead to, I really don't understand.
Here you are in love, and how is it to end?"


Patches of red come into Nikolay Timofeitch's face round his eyes.
He crushes the soft feather trimming in his hand and goes on
muttering:


"Do you imagine he'll marry you--is that it? You'd better drop
any such fancies. Students are forbidden to marry. And do you suppose
he comes to see you with honourable intentions? A likely idea! Why,
these fine students don't look on us as human beings . . . they
only go to see shopkeepers and dressmakers to laugh at their ignorance
and to drink. They're ashamed to drink at home and in good houses,
but with simple uneducated people like us they don't care what any
one thinks; they'd be ready to stand on their heads. Yes! Well,
which feather trimming will you take? And if he hangs about and
carries on with you, we know what he is after. . . . When he's a
doctor or a lawyer he'll remember you: 'Ah,' he'll say, 'I used to
have a pretty fair little thing! I wonder where she is now?' Even
now I bet you he boasts among his friends that he's got his eye on
a little dressmaker."


Polinka sits down and gazes pensively at the pile of white boxes.


"No, I won't take the feather trimming," she sighs. "Mamma had
better choose it for herself; I may get the wrong one. I want six
yards of fringe for an overcoat, at forty kopecks the yard. For the
same coat I want cocoa-nut buttons, perforated, so they can be sown
on firmly. . . ."


Nikolay Timofeitch wraps up the fringe and the buttons. She looks
at him guiltily and evidently expects him to go on talking, but he
remains sullenly silent while he tidies up the feather trimming.


"I mustn't forget some buttons for a dressing-gown . . ." she says
after an interval of silence, wiping her pale lips with a handkerchief.


"What kind?"


"It's for a shopkeeper's wife, so give me something rather striking."


"Yes, if it's for a shopkeeper's wife, you'd better have something
bright. Here are some buttons. A combination of colours--red,
blue, and the fashionable gold shade. Very glaring. The more refined
prefer dull black with a bright border. But I don't understand.
Can't you see for yourself? What can these . . . walks lead to?"


"I don't know," whispers Polinka, and she bends over the buttons;
"I don't know myself what's come to me, Nikolay Timofeitch."


A solid shopman with whiskers forces his way behind Nikolay
Timofeitch's back, squeezing him to the counter, and beaming with
the choicest gallantry, shouts:


"Be so kind, madam, as to step into this department. We have three
kinds of jerseys: plain, braided, and trimmed with beads! Which may
I have the pleasure of showing you?"


At the same time a stout lady passes by Polinka, pronouncing in a
rich, deep voice, almost a bass:


"They must be seamless, with the trade mark stamped in them, please."


"Pretend to be looking at the things," Nikolay Timofeitch whispers,
bending down to Polinka with a forced smile. "Dear me, you do look
pale and ill; you are quite changed. He'll throw you over, Pelagea
Sergeevna! Or if he does marry you, it won't be for love but from
hunger; he'll be tempted by your money. He'll furnish himself a
nice home with your dowry, and then be ashamed of you. He'll keep
you out of sight of his friends and visitors, because you're
uneducated. He'll call you 'my dummy of a wife.' You wouldn't know
how to behave in a doctor's or lawyer's circle. To them you're a
dressmaker, an ignorant creature."


"Nikolay Timofeitch!" somebody shouts from the other end of the
shop. "The young lady here wants three yards of ribbon with a metal
stripe. Have we any?"


Nikolay Timofeitch turns in that direction, smirks and shouts:


"Yes, we have! Ribbon with a metal stripe, ottoman with a satin
stripe, and satin with a moirÃ© stripe!"


"Oh, by the way, I mustn't forget, Olga asked me to get her a pair
of stays!" says Polinka.


"There are tears in your eyes," says Nikolay Timofeitch in dismay.
"What's that for? Come to the corset department, I'll screen you
--it looks awkward."


With a forced smile and exaggeratedly free and easy manner, the
shopman rapidly conducts Polinka to the corset department and
conceals her from the public eye behind a high pyramid of boxes.


"What sort of corset may I show you?" he asks aloud, whispering
immediately: "Wipe your eyes!"


"I want . . . I want . . . size forty-eight centimetres. Only she
wanted one, lined . . . with real whalebone . . . I must talk to
you, Nikolay Timofeitch. Come to-day!"


"Talk? What about? There's nothing to talk about."


"You are the only person who . . . cares about me, and I've no one
to talk to but you."


"These are not reed or steel, but real whalebone. . . . What is
there for us to talk about? It's no use talking. . . . You are going
for a walk with him to-day, I suppose?"


"Yes; I . . . I am."


"Then what's the use of talking? Talk won't help. . . . You are in
love, aren't you?"


"Yes . . ." Polinka whispers hesitatingly, and big tears gush from
her eyes.


"What is there to say?" mutters Nikolay Timofeitch, shrugging his
shoulders nervously and turning pale. "There's no need of talk. . . .
Wipe your eyes, that's all. I . . . I ask for nothing."


At that moment a tall, lanky shopman comes up to the pyramid of
boxes, and says to his customer:


"Let me show you some good elastic garters that do not impede the
circulation, certified by medical authority . . ."


Nikolay Timofeitch screens Polinka, and, trying to conceal her
emotion and his own, wrinkles his face into a smile and says aloud:


"There are two kinds of lace, madam: cotton and silk! Oriental,
English, Valenciennes, crochet, torchon, are cotton. And rococo,
soutache, Cambray, are silk. . . . For God's sake, wipe your eyes!
They're coming this way!"


And seeing that her tears are still gushing he goes on louder than
ever:


"Spanish, Rococo, soutache, Cambray . . . stockings, thread, cotton,
silk . . ."




ANYUTA


IN the cheapest room of a big block of furnished apartments Stepan
Klotchkov, a medical student in his third year, was walking to and
fro, zealously conning his anatomy. His mouth was dry and his
forehead perspiring from the unceasing effort to learn it by heart.


In the window, covered by patterns of frost, sat on a stool the
girl who shared his room--Anyuta, a thin little brunette of
five-and-twenty, very pale with mild grey eyes. Sitting with bent
back she was busy embroidering with red thread the collar of a man's
shirt. She was working against time. . . . The clock in the passage
struck two drowsily, yet the little room had not been put to rights
for the morning. Crumpled bed-clothes, pillows thrown about, books,
clothes, a big filthy slop-pail filled with soap-suds in which
cigarette ends were swimming, and the litter on the floor--all
seemed as though purposely jumbled together in one confusion. . . .


"The right lung consists of three parts . . ." Klotchkov repeated.
"Boundaries! Upper part on anterior wall of thorax reaches the
fourth or fifth rib, on the lateral surface, the fourth rib . . .
behind to the _spina scapulÃ¦_. . ."


Klotchkov raised his eyes to the ceiling, striving to visualise
what he had just read. Unable to form a clear picture of it, he
began feeling his upper ribs through his waistcoat.


"These ribs are like the keys of a piano," he said. "One must
familiarise oneself with them somehow, if one is not to get muddled
over them. One must study them in the skeleton and the living body
. . . . I say, Anyuta, let me pick them out."


Anyuta put down her sewing, took off her blouse, and straightened
herself up. Klotchkov sat down facing her, frowned, and began
counting her ribs.


"H'm! . . . One can't feel the first rib; it's behind the shoulder-blade
. . . . This must be the second rib. . . . Yes . . . this is the third
. . . this is the fourth. . . . H'm! . . . yes. . . . Why are you
wriggling?"


"Your fingers are cold!"


"Come, come . . . it won't kill you. Don't twist about. That must
be the third rib, then . . . this is the fourth. . . . You look
such a skinny thing, and yet one can hardly feel your ribs. That's
the second . . . that's the third. . . . Oh, this is muddling, and
one can't see it clearly. . . . I must draw it. . . . Where's my
crayon?"


Klotchkov took his crayon and drew on Anyuta's chest several parallel
lines corresponding with the ribs.


"First-rate. That's all straightforward. . . . Well, now I can sound
you. Stand up!"


Anyuta stood up and raised her chin. Klotchkov began sounding her,
and was so absorbed in this occupation that he did not notice how
Anyuta's lips, nose, and fingers turned blue with cold. Anyuta
shivered, and was afraid the student, noticing it, would leave off
drawing and sounding her, and then, perhaps, might fail in his exam.


"Now it's all clear," said Klotchkov when he had finished. "You sit
like that and don't rub off the crayon, and meanwhile I'll learn
up a little more."


And the student again began walking to and fro, repeating to himself.
Anyuta, with black stripes across her chest, looking as though she
had been tattooed, sat thinking, huddled up and shivering with cold.
She said very little as a rule; she was always silent, thinking and
thinking. . . .


In the six or seven years of her wanderings from one furnished room
to another, she had known five students like Klotchkov. Now they
had all finished their studies, had gone out into the world, and,
of course, like respectable people, had long ago forgotten her. One
of them was living in Paris, two were doctors, the fourth was an
artist, and the fifth was said to be already a professor. Klotchkov
was the sixth. . . . Soon he, too, would finish his studies and go
out into the world. There was a fine future before him, no doubt,
and Klotchkov probably would become a great man, but the present
was anything but bright; Klotchkov had no tobacco and no tea, and
there were only four lumps of sugar left. She must make haste and
finish her embroidery, take it to the woman who had ordered it, and
with the quarter rouble she would get for it, buy tea and tobacco.


"Can I come in?" asked a voice at the door.


Anyuta quickly threw a woollen shawl over her shoulders. Fetisov,
the artist, walked in.


"I have come to ask you a favour," he began, addressing Klotchkov,
and glaring like a wild beast from under the long locks that hung
over his brow. "Do me a favour; lend me your young lady just for a
couple of hours! I'm painting a picture, you see, and I can't get
on without a model."


"Oh, with pleasure," Klotchkov agreed. "Go along, Anyuta."


"The things I've had to put up with there," Anyuta murmured softly.


"Rubbish! The man's asking you for the sake of art, and not for any
sort of nonsense. Why not help him if you can?"


Anyuta began dressing.


"And what are you painting?" asked Klotchkov.


"Psyche; it's a fine subject. But it won't go, somehow. I have to
keep painting from different models. Yesterday I was painting one
with blue legs. 'Why are your legs blue?' I asked her. 'It's my
stockings stain them,' she said. And you're still grinding! Lucky
fellow! You have patience."


"Medicine's a job one can't get on with without grinding."


"H'm! . . . Excuse me, Klotchkov, but you do live like a pig! It's
awful the way you live!"


"How do you mean? I can't help it. . . . I only get twelve roubles
a month from my father, and it's hard to live decently on that."


"Yes . . . yes . . ." said the artist, frowning with an air of
disgust; "but, still, you might live better. . . . An educated man
is in duty bound to have taste, isn't he? And goodness knows what
it's like here! The bed not made, the slops, the dirt . . . yesterday's
porridge in the plates. . . Tfoo!"


"That's true," said the student in confusion; "but Anyuta has had
no time to-day to tidy up; she's been busy all the while."


When Anyuta and the artist had gone out Klotchkov lay down on the
sofa and began learning, lying down; then he accidentally dropped
asleep, and waking up an hour later, propped his head on his fists
and sank into gloomy reflection. He recalled the artist's words
that an educated man was in duty bound to have taste, and his
surroundings actually struck him now as loathsome and revolting.
He saw, as it were in his mind's eye, his own future, when he would
see his patients in his consulting-room, drink tea in a large
dining-room in the company of his wife, a real lady. And now that
slop-pail in which the cigarette ends were swimming looked incredibly
disgusting. Anyuta, too, rose before his imagination--a plain,
slovenly, pitiful figure . . . and he made up his mind to part with
her at once, at all costs.


When, on coming back from the artist's, she took off her coat, he
got up and said to her seriously:


"Look here, my good girl . . . sit down and listen. We must part!
The fact is, I don't want to live with you any longer."


Anyuta had come back from the artist's worn out and exhausted.
Standing so long as a model had made her face look thin and sunken,
and her chin sharper than ever. She said nothing in answer to the
student's words, only her lips began to tremble.


"You know we should have to part sooner or later, anyway," said the
student. "You're a nice, good girl, and not a fool; you'll
understand. . . ."


Anyuta put on her coat again, in silence wrapped up her embroidery
in paper, gathered together her needles and thread: she found the
screw of paper with the four lumps of sugar in the window, and laid
it on the table by the books.


"That's . . . your sugar . . ." she said softly, and turned away
to conceal her tears.


"Why are you crying?" asked Klotchkov.


He walked about the room in confusion, and said:


"You are a strange girl, really. . . . Why, you know we shall have
to part. We can't stay together for ever."


She had gathered together all her belongings, and turned to say
good-bye to him, and he felt sorry for her.


"Shall I let her stay on here another week?" he thought. "She really
may as well stay, and I'll tell her to go in a week;" and vexed at
his own weakness, he shouted to her roughly:


"Come, why are you standing there? If you are going, go; and if you
don't want to, take off your coat and stay! You can stay!"


Anyuta took off her coat, silently, stealthily, then blew her nose
also stealthily, sighed, and noiselessly returned to her invariable
position on her stool by the window.


The student drew his textbook to him and began again pacing from
corner to corner. "The right lung consists of three parts," he
repeated; "the upper part, on anterior wall of thorax, reaches the
fourth or fifth rib . . . ."


In the passage some one shouted at the top of his voice: "Grigory!
The samovar!"




THE TWO VOLODYAS


"LET me; I want to drive myself! I'll sit by the driver!" Sofya
Lvovna said in a loud voice. "Wait a minute, driver; I'll get up
on the box beside you."


She stood up in the sledge, and her husband, Vladimir Nikititch,
and the friend of her childhood, Vladimir Mihalovitch, held her
arms to prevent her falling. The three horses were galloping fast.


"I said you ought not to have given her brandy," Vladimir Nikititch
whispered to his companion with vexation. "What a fellow you are,
really!"


The Colonel knew by experience that in women like his wife, Sofya
Lvovna, after a little too much wine, turbulent gaiety was followed
by hysterical laughter and then tears. He was afraid that when they
got home, instead of being able to sleep, he would have to be
administering compresses and drops.


"Wo!" cried Sofya Lvovna. "I want to drive myself!"


She felt genuinely gay and triumphant. For the last two months,
ever since her wedding, she had been tortured by the thought that
she had married Colonel Yagitch from worldly motives and, as it is
said, _par dÃ©pit_; but that evening, at the restaurant, she had
suddenly become convinced that she loved him passionately. In spite
of his fifty-four years, he was so slim, agile, supple, he made
puns and hummed to the gipsies' tunes so charmingly. Really, the
older men were nowadays a thousand times more interesting than the
young. It seemed as though age and youth had changed parts. The
Colonel was two years older than her father, but could there be any
importance in that if, honestly speaking, there were infinitely
more vitality, go, and freshness in him than in herself, though she
was only twenty-three?


"Oh, my darling!" she thought. "You are wonderful!"


She had become convinced in the restaurant, too, that not a spark
of her old feeling remained. For the friend of her childhood,
Vladimir Mihalovitch, or simply Volodya, with whom only the day
before she had been madly, miserably in love, she now felt nothing
but complete indifference. All that evening he had seemed to her
spiritless, torpid, uninteresting, and insignificant, and the
_sangfroid_ with which he habitually avoided paying at restaurants
on this occasion revolted her, and she had hardly been able to
resist saying, "If you are poor, you should stay at home." The
Colonel paid for all.


Perhaps because trees, telegraph posts, and drifts of snow kept
flitting past her eyes, all sorts of disconnected ideas came rushing
into her mind. She reflected: the bill at the restaurant had been
a hundred and twenty roubles, and a hundred had gone to the gipsies,
and to-morrow she could fling away a thousand roubles if she liked;
and only two months ago, before her wedding, she had not had three
roubles of her own, and had to ask her father for every trifle.
What a change in her life!


Her thoughts were in a tangle. She recalled, how, when she was a
child of ten, Colonel Yagitch, now her husband, used to make love
to her aunt, and every one in the house said that he had ruined
her. And her aunt had, in fact, often come down to dinner with her
eyes red from crying, and was always going off somewhere; and people
used to say of her that the poor thing could find no peace anywhere.
He had been very handsome in those days, and had an extraordinary
reputation as a lady-killer. So much so that he was known all over
the town, and it was said of him that he paid a round of visits to
his adorers every day like a doctor visiting his patients. And even
now, in spite of his grey hair, his wrinkles, and his spectacles,
his thin face looked handsome, especially in profile.


Sofya Lvovna's father was an army doctor, and had at one time served
in the same regiment with Colonel Yagitch. Volodya's father was an
army doctor too, and he, too, had once been in the same regiment
as her father and Colonel Yagitch. In spite of many amatory adventures,
often very complicated and disturbing, Volodya had done splendidly
at the university, and had taken a very good degree. Now he was
specialising in foreign literature, and was said to be writing a
thesis. He lived with his father, the army doctor, in the barracks,
and had no means of his own, though he was thirty. As children Sofya
and he had lived under the same roof, though in different flats.
He often came to play with her, and they had dancing and French
lessons together. But when he grew up into a graceful, remarkably
handsome young man, she began to feel shy of him, and then fell
madly in love with him, and had loved him right up to the time when
she was married to Yagitch. He, too, had been renowned for his
success with women almost from the age of fourteen, and the ladies
who deceived their husbands on his account excused themselves by
saying that he was only a boy. Some one had told a story of him
lately that when he was a student living in lodgings so as to be
near the university, it always happened if one knocked at his door,
that one heard his footstep, and then a whispered apology: "_Pardon,
je ne suis pas setul._" Yagitch was delighted with him, and blessed
him as a worthy successor, as Derchavin blessed Pushkin; he appeared
to be fond of him. They would play billiards or picquet by the hour
together without uttering a word, if Yagitch drove out on any
expedition he always took Volodya with him, and Yagitch was the
only person Volodya initiated into the mysteries of his thesis. In
earlier days, when Yagitch was rather younger, they had often been
in the position of rivals, but they had never been jealous of one
another. In the circle in which they moved Yagitch was nicknamed
Big Volodya, and his friend Little Volodya.


Besides Big Volodya, Little Volodya, and Sofya Lvovna, there was a
fourth person in the sledge--Margarita Alexandrovna, or, as every
one called her, Rita, a cousin of Madame Yagitch--a very pale
girl over thirty, with black eyebrows and a pince-nez, who was for
ever smoking cigarettes, even in the bitterest frost, and who always
had her knees and the front of her blouse covered with cigarette
ash. She spoke through her nose, drawling every word, was of a cold
temperament, could drink any amount of wine and liquor without being
drunk, and used to tell scandalous anecdotes in a languid and
tasteless way. At home she spent her days reading thick magazines,
covering them with cigarette ash, or eating frozen apples.


"Sonia, give over fooling," she said, drawling. "It's really silly."


As they drew near the city gates they went more slowly, and began
to pass people and houses. Sofya Lvovna subsided, nestled up to her
husband, and gave herself up to her thoughts. Little Volodya sat
opposite. By now her light-hearted and cheerful thoughts were mingled
with gloomy ones. She thought that the man sitting opposite knew
that she loved him, and no doubt he believed the gossip that she
married the Colonel _par dÃ©pit_. She had never told him of her love;
she had not wanted him to know, and had done her best to hide her
feeling, but from her face she knew that he understood her perfectly
--and her pride suffered. But what was most humiliating in her
position was that, since her wedding, Volodya had suddenly begun
to pay her attention, which he had never done before, spending hours
with her, sitting silent or chattering about trifles; and even now
in the sledge, though he did not talk to her, he touched her foot
with his and pressed her hand a little. Evidently that was all he
wanted, that she should be married; and it was evident that he
despised her and that she only excited in him an interest of a
special kind as though she were an immoral and disreputable woman.
And when the feeling of triumph and love for her husband were mingled
in her soul with humiliation and wounded pride, she was overcome
by a spirit of defiance, and longed to sit on the box, to shout and
whistle to the horses.


Just as they passed the nunnery the huge hundred-ton bell rang out.
Rita crossed herself.


"Our Olga is in that nunnery," said Sofya Lvovna, and she, too,
crossed herself and shuddered.


"Why did she go into the nunnery?" said the Colonel.


"_Par dÃ©pit_," Rita answered crossly, with obvious allusion to
Sofya's marrying Yagitch. "_Par dÃ©pit_ is all the fashion nowadays.
Defiance of all the world. She was always laughing, a desperate
flirt, fond of nothing but balls and young men, and all of a sudden
off she went--to surprise every one!"


"That's not true," said Volodya, turning down the collar of his fur
coat and showing his handsome face. "It wasn't a case of _par dÃ©pit_;
it was simply horrible, if you like. Her brother Dmitri was sent
to penal servitude, and they don't know where he is now. And her
mother died of grief."


He turned up his collar again.


"Olga did well," he added in a muffled voice. "Living as an adopted
child, and with such a paragon as Sofya Lvovna,--one must take
that into consideration too!"


Sofya Lvovna heard a tone of contempt in his voice, and longed to
say something rude to him, but she said nothing. The spirit of
defiance came over her again; she stood up again and shouted in a
tearful voice:


"I want to go to the early service! Driver, back! I want to see
Olga."


They turned back. The nunnery bell had a deep note, and Sofya Lvovna
fancied there was something in it that reminded her of Olga and her
life. The other church bells began ringing too. When the driver
stopped the horses, Sofya Lvovna jumped out of the sledge and,
unescorted and alone, went quickly up to the gate.


"Make haste, please!" her husband called to her. "It's late already."


She went in at the dark gateway, then by the avenue that led from
the gate to the chief church. The snow crunched under her feet, and
the ringing was just above her head, and seemed to vibrate through
her whole being. Here was the church door, then three steps down,
and an ante-room with ikons of the saints on both sides, a fragrance
of juniper and incense, another door, and a dark figure opening it
and bowing very low. The service had not yet begun. One nun was
walking by the ikon-screen and lighting the candles on the tall
standard candlesticks, another was lighting the chandelier. Here
and there, by the columns and the side chapels, there stood black,
motionless figures. "I suppose they must remain standing as they
are now till the morning," thought Sofya Lvovna, and it seemed to
her dark, cold, and dreary--drearier than a graveyard. She looked
with a feeling of dreariness at the still, motionless figures and
suddenly felt a pang at her heart. For some reason, in one short
nun, with thin shoulders and a black kerchief on her head, she
recognised Olga, though when Olga went into the nunnery she had
been plump and had looked taller. Hesitating and extremely agitated,
Sofya Lvovna went up to the nun, and looking over her shoulder into
her face, recognised her as Olga.


"Olga!" she cried, throwing up her hands, and could not speak from
emotion. "Olga!"


The nun knew her at once; she raised her eyebrows in surprise, and
her pale, freshly washed face, and even, it seemed, the white
headcloth that she wore under her wimple, beamed with pleasure.


"What a miracle from God!" she said, and she, too, threw up her
thin, pale little hands.


Sofya Lvovna hugged her and kissed her warmly, and was afraid as
she did so that she might smell of spirits.


"We were just driving past, and we thought of you," she said,
breathing hard, as though she had been running. "Dear me! How pale
you are! I . . . I'm very glad to see you. Well, tell me how are
you? Are you dull?"


Sofya Lvovna looked round at the other nuns, and went on in a subdued
voice:


"There've been so many changes at home . . . you know, I'm married
to Colonel Yagitch. You remember him, no doubt. . . . I am very
happy with him."


"Well, thank God for that. And is your father quite well?"


"Yes, he is quite well. He often speaks of you. You must come and
see us during the holidays, Olga, won't you?"


"I will come," said Olga, and she smiled. "I'll come on the second
day."


Sofya Lvovna began crying, she did not know why, and for a minute
she shed tears in silence, then she wiped her eyes and said:


"Rita will be very sorry not to have seen you. She is with us too.
And Volodya's here. They are close to the gate. How pleased they'd
be if you'd come out and see them. Let's go out to them; the service
hasn't begun yet."


"Let us," Olga agreed. She crossed herself three times and went out
with Sofya Lvovna to the entrance.


"So you say you're happy, Sonitchka?" she asked when they came out
at the gate.


"Very."


"Well, thank God for that."


The two Volodyas, seeing the nun, got out of the sledge and greeted
her respectfully. Both were visibly touched by her pale face and
her black monastic dress, and both were pleased that she had
remembered them and come to greet them. That she might not be cold,
Sofya Lvovna wrapped her up in a rug and put one half of her fur
coat round her. Her tears had relieved and purified her heart, and
she was glad that this noisy, restless, and, in reality, impure
night should unexpectedly end so purely and serenely. And to keep
Olga by her a little longer she suggested:


"Let us take her for a drive! Get in, Olga; we'll go a little way."


The men expected the nun to refuse--saints don't dash about in
three-horse sledges; but to their surprise, she consented and got
into the sledge. And while the horses were galloping to the city
gate all were silent, and only tried to make her warm and comfortable,
and each of them was thinking of what she had been in the past and
what she was now. Her face was now passionless, inexpressive, cold,
pale, and transparent, as though there were water, not blood, in
her veins. And two or three years ago she had been plump and rosy,
talking about her suitors and laughing at every trifle.


Near the city gate the sledge turned back; when it stopped ten
minutes later near the nunnery, Olga got out of the sledge. The
bell had begun to ring more rapidly.


"The Lord save you," said Olga, and she bowed low as nuns do.


"Mind you come, Olga."


"I will, I will."


She went and quickly disappeared through the gateway. And when after
that they drove on again, Sofya Lvovna felt very sad. Every one was
silent. She felt dispirited and weak all over. That she should have
made a nun get into a sledge and drive in a company hardly sober
seemed to her now stupid, tactless, and almost sacrilegious. As the
intoxication passed off, the desire to deceive herself passed away
also. It was clear to her now that she did not love her husband,
and never could love him, and that it all had been foolishness and
nonsense. She had married him from interested motives, because, in
the words of her school friends, he was madly rich, and because she
was afraid of becoming an old maid like Rita, and because she was
sick of her father, the doctor, and wanted to annoy Volodya.


If she could have imagined when she got married, that it would be
so oppressive, so dreadful, and so hideous, she would not have
consented to the marriage for all the wealth in the world. But now
there was no setting it right. She must make up her mind to it.


They reached home. Getting into her warm, soft bed, and pulling the
bed-clothes over her, Sofya Lvovna recalled the dark church, the
smell of incense, and the figures by the columns, and she felt
frightened at the thought that these figures would be standing there
all the while she was asleep. The early service would be very, very
long; then there would be "the hours," then the mass, then the
service of the day.


"But of course there is a God--there certainly is a God; and I
shall have to die, so that sooner or later one must think of one's
soul, of eternal life, like Olga. Olga is saved now; she has settled
all questions for herself. . . . But if there is no God? Then her
life is wasted. But how is it wasted? Why is it wasted?"


And a minute later the thought came into her mind again:


"There is a God; death must come; one must think of one's soul. If
Olga were to see death before her this minute she would not be
afraid. She is prepared. And the great thing is that she has already
solved the problem of life for herself. There is a God . . . yes
. . . . But is there no other solution except going into a monastery?
To go into the monastery means to renounce life, to spoil it . . . ."


Sofya Lvovna began to feel rather frightened; she hid her head under
her pillow.


"I mustn't think about it," she whispered. "I mustn't. . . ."


Yagitch was walking about on the carpet in the next room with a
soft jingle of spurs, thinking about something. The thought occurred
to Sofya Lvovna that this man was near and dear to her only for one
reason--that his name, too, was Vladimir. She sat up in bed and
called tenderly:


"Volodya!"


"What is it?" her husband responded.


"Nothing."


She lay down again. She heard a bell, perhaps the same nunnery bell.
Again she thought of the vestibule and the dark figures, and thoughts
of God and of inevitable death strayed through her mind, and she
covered her ears that she might not hear the bell. She thought that
before old age and death there would be a long, long life before
her, and that day by day she would have to put up with being close
to a man she did not love, who had just now come into the bedroom
and was getting into bed, and would have to stifle in her heart her
hopeless love for the other young, fascinating, and, as she thought,
exceptional man. She looked at her husband and tried to say good-night
to him, but suddenly burst out crying instead. She was vexed with
herself.


"Well, now then for the music!" said Yagitch.


She was not pacified till ten o'clock in the morning. She left off
crying and trembling all over, but she began to have a splitting
headache. Yagitch was in haste to go to the late mass, and in the
next room was grumbling at his orderly, who was helping him to
dress. He came into the bedroom once with the soft jingle of his
spurs to fetch something, and then a second time wearing his
epaulettes, and his orders on his breast, limping slightly from
rheumatism; and it struck Sofya Lvovna that he looked and walked
like a bird of prey.


She heard Yagitch ring the telephone bell.


"Be so good as to put me on to the Vassilevsky barracks," he said;
and a minute later: "Vassilevsky barracks? Please ask Doctor
Salimovitch to come to the telephone . . ." And a minute later:
"With whom am I speaking? Is it you, Volodya? Delighted. Ask your
father to come to us at once, dear boy; my wife is rather shattered
after yesterday. Not at home, you say? H'm! . . . Thank you. Very
good. I shall be much obliged . . . _Merci_."


Yagitch came into the bedroom for the third time, bent down to his
wife, made the sign of the cross over her, gave her his hand to
kiss (the women who had been in love with him used to kiss his hand
and he had got into the habit of it), and saying that he should be
back to dinner, went out.


At twelve o'clock the maid came in to announce that Vladimir
Mihalovitch had arrived. Sofya Lvovna, staggering with fatigue and
headache, hurriedly put on her marvellous new lilac dressing-gown
trimmed with fur, and hastily did up her hair after a fashion. She
was conscious of an inexpressible tenderness in her heart, and was
trembling with joy and with fear that he might go away. She wanted
nothing but to look at him.


Volodya came dressed correctly for calling, in a swallow-tail coat
and white tie. When Sofya Lvovna came in he kissed her hand and
expressed his genuine regret that she was ill. Then when they had
sat down, he admired her dressing-gown.


"I was upset by seeing Olga yesterday," she said. "At first I felt
it dreadful, but now I envy her. She is like a rock that cannot be
shattered; there is no moving her. But was there no other solution
for her, Volodya? Is burying oneself alive the only solution of the
problem of life? Why, it's death, not life!"


At the thought of Olga, Volodya's face softened.


"Here, you are a clever man, Volodya," said Sofya Lvovna. "Show me
how to do what Olga has done. Of course, I am not a believer and
should not go into a nunnery, but one can do something equivalent.
Life isn't easy for me," she added after a brief pause. "Tell me
what to do. . . . Tell me something I can believe in. Tell me
something, if it's only one word."


"One word? By all means: tararaboomdeeay."


"Volodya, why do you despise me?" she asked hotly. "You talk to me
in a special, fatuous way, if you'll excuse me, not as one talks
to one's friends and women one respects. You are so good at your
work, you are fond of science; why do you never talk of it to me?
Why is it? Am I not good enough?"


Volodya frowned with annoyance and said:


"Why do you want science all of a sudden? Don't you perhaps want
constitutional government? Or sturgeon and horse-radish?"


"Very well, I am a worthless, trivial, silly woman with no convictions.
I have a mass, a mass of defects. I am neurotic, corrupt, and I
ought to be despised for it. But you, Volodya, are ten years older
than I am, and my husband is thirty years older. I've grown up
before your eyes, and if you would, you could have made anything
you liked of me--an angel. But you"--her voice quivered--
"treat me horribly. Yagitch has married me in his old age, and
you . . ."


"Come, come," said Volodya, sitting nearer her and kissing both her
hands. "Let the Schopenhauers philosophise and prove whatever they
like, while we'll kiss these little hands."


"You despise me, and if only you knew how miserable it makes me,"
she said uncertainly, knowing beforehand that he would not believe
her. "And if you only knew how I want to change, to begin another
life! I think of it with enthusiasm!" and tears of enthusiasm
actually came into her eyes. "To be good, honest, pure, not to be
lying; to have an object in life."


"Come, come, come, please don't be affected! I don't like it!" said
Volodya, and an ill-humoured expression came into his face. "Upon
my word, you might be on the stage. Let us behave like simple
people."


To prevent him from getting cross and going away, she began defending
herself, and forced herself to smile to please him; and again she
began talking of Olga, and of how she longed to solve the problem
of her life and to become something real.


"Ta-ra-ra-boomdee-ay," he hummed. "Ta-ra-ra-boom-dee-ay!"


And all at once he put his arm round her waist, while she, without
knowing what she was doing, laid her hands on his shoulders and for
a minute gazed with ecstasy, almost intoxication, at his clever,
ironical face, his brow, his eyes, his handsome beard.


"You have known that I love you for ever so long," she confessed
to him, and she blushed painfully, and felt that her lips were
twitching with shame. "I love you. Why do you torture me?"


She shut her eyes and kissed him passionately on the lips, and for
a long while, a full minute, could not take her lips away, though
she knew it was unseemly, that he might be thinking the worse of
her, that a servant might come in.


"Oh, how you torture me!" she repeated.


When half an hour later, having got all that he wanted, he was
sitting at lunch in the dining-room, she was kneeling before him,
gazing greedily into his face, and he told her that she was like a
little dog waiting for a bit of ham to be thrown to it. Then he sat
her on his knee, and dancing her up and down like a child, hummed:


"Tara-raboom-dee-ay. . . . Tara-raboom-dee-ay." And when he was
getting ready to go she asked him in a passionate whisper:


"When? To-day? Where?" And held out both hands to his mouth as
though she wanted to seize his answer in them.


"To-day it will hardly be convenient," he said after a minute's
thought. "To-morrow, perhaps."


And they parted. Before dinner Sofya Lvovna went to the nunnery to
see Olga, but there she was told that Olga was reading the psalter
somewhere over the dead. From the nunnery she went to her father's
and found that he, too, was out. Then she took another sledge and
drove aimlessly about the streets till evening. And for some reason
she kept thinking of the aunt whose eyes were red with crying, and
who could find no peace anywhere.


And at night they drove out again with three horses to a restaurant
out of town and listened to the gipsies. And driving back past the
nunnery again, Sofya Lvovna thought of Olga, and she felt aghast
at the thought that for the girls and women of her class there was
no solution but to go on driving about and telling lies, or going
into a nunnery to mortify the flesh. . . . And next day she met her
lover, and again Sofya Lvovna drove about the town alone in a hired
sledge thinking about her aunt.


A week later Volodya threw her over. And after that life went on
as before, uninteresting, miserable, and sometimes even agonising.
The Colonel and Volodya spent hours playing billiards and picquet,
Rita told anecdotes in the same languid, tasteless way, and Sofya
Lvovna went about alone in hired sledges and kept begging her husband
to take her for a good drive with three horses.


Going almost every day to the nunnery, she wearied Olga, complaining
of her unbearable misery, weeping, and feeling as she did so that
she brought with her into the cell something impure, pitiful, shabby.
And Olga repeated to her mechanically as though a lesson learnt by
rote, that all this was of no consequence, that it would all pass
and God would forgive her.




THE TROUSSEAU


I HAVE seen a great many houses in my time, little and big, new and
old, built of stone and of wood, but of one house I have kept a
very vivid memory. It was, properly speaking, rather a cottage than
a house--a tiny cottage of one story, with three windows, looking
extraordinarily like a little old hunchback woman with a cap on.
Its white stucco walls, its tiled roof, and dilapidated chimney,
were all drowned in a perfect sea of green. The cottage was lost
to sight among the mulberry-trees, acacias, and poplars planted by
the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of its present occupants.
And yet it is a town house. Its wide courtyard stands in a row with
other similar green courtyards, and forms part of a street. Nothing
ever drives down that street, and very few persons are ever seen
walking through it.


The shutters of the little house are always closed; its occupants
do not care for sunlight--the light is no use to them. The windows
are never opened, for they are not fond of fresh air. People who
spend their lives in the midst of acacias, mulberries, and nettles
have no passion for nature. It is only to the summer visitor that
God has vouchsafed an eye for the beauties of nature. The rest of
mankind remain steeped in profound ignorance of the existence of
such beauties. People never prize what they have always had in
abundance. "What we have, we do not treasure," and what's more we
do not even love it.


The little house stands in an earthly paradise of green trees with
happy birds nesting in them. But inside . . . alas . . . ! In summer,
it is close and stifling within; in winter, hot as a Turkish bath,
not one breath of air, and the dreariness! . . .


The first time I visited the little house was many years ago on
business. I brought a message from the Colonel who was the owner
of the house to his wife and daughter. That first visit I remember
very distinctly. It would be impossible, indeed, to forget it.


Imagine a limp little woman of forty, gazing at you with alarm and
astonishment while you walk from the passage into the parlour. You
are a stranger, a visitor, "a young man"; that's enough to reduce
her to a state of terror and bewilderment. Though you have no dagger,
axe, or revolver in your hand, and though you smile affably, you
are met with alarm.


"Whom have I the honour and pleasure of addressing?" the little
lady asks in a trembling voice.


I introduced myself and explained why I had come. The alarm and
amazement were at once succeeded by a shrill, joyful "Ach!" and she
turned her eyes upwards to the ceiling. This "Ach!" was caught up
like an echo and repeated from the hall to the parlour, from the
parlour to the kitchen, and so on down to the cellar. Soon the whole
house was resounding with "Ach!" in various voices.


Five minutes later I was sitting on a big, soft, warm lounge in the
drawing-room listening to the "Ach!" echoing all down the street.
There was a smell of moth powder, and of goatskin shoes, a pair of
which lay on a chair beside me wrapped in a handkerchief. In the
windows were geraniums, and muslin curtains, and on the curtains
were torpid flies. On the wall hung the portrait of some bishop,
painted in oils, with the glass broken at one corner, and next to
the bishop a row of ancestors with lemon-coloured faces of a gipsy
type. On the table lay a thimble, a reel of cotton, and a half-knitted
stocking, and paper patterns and a black blouse, tacked together,
were lying on the floor. In the next room two alarmed and fluttered
old women were hurriedly picking up similar patterns and pieces of
tailor's chalk from the floor.


"You must, please, excuse us; we are dreadfully untidy," said the
little lady.


While she talked to me, she stole embarrassed glances towards the
other room where the patterns were still being picked up. The door,
too, seemed embarrassed, opening an inch or two and then shutting
again.


"What's the matter?" said the little lady, addressing the door.


_"OÃ¹ est mon cravatte lequel mon pÃ¨re m'avait envoyÃ© de Koursk?"_
asked a female voice at the door.


_"Ah, est-ce que, Marie . . . que_. . . Really, it's impossible
. . . . _Nous avons donc chez nous un homme peu connu de nous._ Ask
Lukerya."


"How well we speak French, though!" I read in the eyes of the little
lady, who was flushing with pleasure.


Soon afterwards the door opened and I saw a tall, thin girl of
nineteen, in a long muslin dress with a gilt belt from which, I
remember, hung a mother-of-pearl fan. She came in, dropped a curtsy,
and flushed crimson. Her long nose, which was slightly pitted with
smallpox, turned red first, and then the flush passed up to her
eyes and her forehead.


"My daughter," chanted the little lady, "and, Manetchka, this is a
young gentleman who has come," etc.


I was introduced, and expressed my surprise at the number of paper
patterns. Mother and daughter dropped their eyes.


"We had a fair here at Ascension," said the mother; "we always buy
materials at the fair, and then it keeps us busy with sewing till
the next year's fair comes around again. We never put things out
to be made. My husband's pay is not very ample, and we are not able
to permit ourselves luxuries. So we have to make up everything
ourselves."


"But who will ever wear such a number of things? There are only two
of you?"


"Oh . . . as though we were thinking of wearing them! They are not
to be worn; they are for the trousseau!"


"Ah, _mamam_, what are you saying?" said the daughter, and she
crimsoned again. "Our visitor might suppose it was true. I don't
intend to be married. Never!"


She said this, but at the very word "married" her eyes glowed.


Tea, biscuits, butter, and jam were brought in, followed by raspberries
and cream. At seven o'clock, we had supper, consisting of six
courses, and while we were at supper I heard a loud yawn from the
next room. I looked with surprise towards the door: it was a yawn
that could only come from a man.


"That's my husband's brother, Yegor Semyonitch," the little lady
explained, noticing my surprise. "He's been living with us for the
last year. Please excuse him; he cannot come in to see you. He is
such an unsociable person, he is shy with strangers. He is going
into a monastery. He was unfairly treated in the service, and the
disappointment has preyed on his mind."


After supper the little lady showed the vestment which Yegor
Semyonitch was embroidering with his own hands as an offering for
the Church. Manetchka threw off her shyness for a moment and showed
me the tobacco-pouch she was embroidering for her father. When I
pretended to be greatly struck by her work, she flushed crimson and
whispered something in her mother's ear. The latter beamed all over,
and invited me to go with her to the store-room. There I was shown
five large trunks, and a number of smaller trunks and boxes.


"This is her trousseau," her mother whispered; "we made it all
ourselves."


After looking at these forbidding trunks I took leave of my hospitable
hostesses. They made me promise to come and see them again some
day.


It happened that I was able to keep this promise. Seven years after
my first visit, I was sent down to the little town to give expert
evidence in a case that was being tried there.


As I entered the little house I heard the same "Ach!" echo through
it. They recognised me at once. . . . Well they might! My first
visit had been an event in their lives, and when events are few
they are long remembered.


I walked into the drawing-room: the mother, who had grown stouter
and was already getting grey, was creeping about on the floor,
cutting out some blue material. The daughter was sitting on the
sofa, embroidering.


There was the same smell of moth powder; there were the same patterns,
the same portrait with the broken glass. But yet there was a change.
Beside the portrait of the bishop hung a portrait of the Colonel,
and the ladies were in mourning. The Colonel's death had occurred
a week after his promotion to be a general.


Reminiscences began. . . . The widow shed tears.


"We have had a terrible loss," she said. "My husband, you know, is
dead. We are alone in the world now, and have no one but ourselves
to look to. Yegor Semyonitch is alive, but I have no good news to
tell of him. They would not have him in the monastery on account
of--of intoxicating beverages. And now in his disappointment he
drinks more than ever. I am thinking of going to the Marshal of
Nobility to lodge a complaint. Would you believe it, he has more
than once broken open the trunks and . . . taken Manetchka's trousseau
and given it to beggars. He has taken everything out of two of the
trunks! If he goes on like this, my Manetchka will be left without
a trousseau at all."


"What are you saying, _mamam_?" said Manetchka, embarrassed. "Our
visitor might suppose . . . there's no knowing what he might suppose
. . . . I shall never--never marry."


Manetchka cast her eyes up to the ceiling with a look of hope and
aspiration, evidently not for a moment believing what she said.


A little bald-headed masculine figure in a brown coat and goloshes
instead of boots darted like a mouse across the passage and
disappeared. "Yegor Semyonitch, I suppose," I thought.


I looked at the mother and daughter together. They both looked much
older and terribly changed. The mother's hair was silvered, but the
daughter was so faded and withered that her mother might have been
taken for her elder sister, not more than five years her senior.


"I have made up my mind to go to the Marshal," the mother said to
me, forgetting she had told me this already. "I mean to make a
complaint. Yegor Semyonitch lays his hands on everything we make,
and offers it up for the sake of his soul. My Manetchka is left
without a trousseau."


Manetchka flushed again, but this time she said nothing.


"We have to make them all over again. And God knows we are not so
well off. We are all alone in the world now."


"We are alone in the world," repeated Manetchka.


A year ago fate brought me once more to the little house.


Walking into the drawing-room, I saw the old lady. Dressed all in
black with heavy crape _pleureuses_, she was sitting on the sofa
sewing. Beside her sat the little old man in the brown coat and the
goloshes instead of boots. On seeing me, he jumped up and ran out
of the room.


In response to my greeting, the old lady smiled and said:


_"Je suis charmÃ©e de vous revoir, monsieur."_


"What are you making?" I asked, a little later.


"It's a blouse. When it's finished I shall take it to the priest's
to be put away, or else Yegor Semyonitch would carry it off. I store
everything at the priest's now," she added in a whisper.


And looking at the portrait of her daughter which stood before her
on the table, she sighed and said:


"We are all alone in the world."


And where was the daughter? Where was Manetchka? I did not ask. I
did not dare to ask the old mother dressed in her new deep mourning.
And while I was in the room, and when I got up to go, no Manetchka
came out to greet me. I did not hear her voice, nor her soft, timid
footstep. . . .


I understood, and my heart was heavy.




THE HELPMATE


"I'VE asked you not to tidy my table," said Nikolay Yevgrafitch.
"There's no finding anything when you've tidied up. Where's the
telegram? Where have you thrown it? Be so good as to look for it.
It's from Kazan, dated yesterday."


The maid--a pale, very slim girl with an indifferent expression
--found several telegrams in the basket under the table, and handed
them to the doctor without a word; but all these were telegrams
from patients. Then they looked in the drawing-room, and in Olga
Dmitrievna's room.


It was past midnight. Nikolay Yevgrafitch knew his wife would not
be home very soon, not till five o'clock at least. He did not trust
her, and when she was long away he could not sleep, was worried,
and at the same time he despised his wife, and her bed, and her
looking-glass, and her boxes of sweets, and the hyacinths, and the
lilies of the valley which were sent her every day by some one or
other, and which diffused the sickly fragrance of a florist's shop
all over the house. On such nights he became petty, ill-humoured,
irritable, and he fancied now that it was very necessary for him
to have the telegram he had received the day before from his brother,
though it contained nothing but Christmas greetings.


On the table of his wife's room under the box of stationery he found
a telegram, and glanced at it casually. It was addressed to his
wife, care of his mother-in-law, from Monte Carlo, and signed Michel
. . . . The doctor did not understand one word of it, as it was in
some foreign language, apparently English.


"Who is this Michel? Why Monte Carlo? Why directed care of her
mother?"


During the seven years of his married life he had grown used to
being suspicious, guessing, catching at clues, and it had several
times occurred to him, that his exercise at home had qualified him
to become an excellent detective. Going into his study and beginning
to reflect, he recalled at once how he had been with his wife in
Petersburg a year and a half ago, and had lunched with an old
school-fellow, a civil engineer, and how that engineer had introduced
to him and his wife a young man of two or three and twenty, called
Mihail Ivanovitch, with rather a curious short surname--Riss. Two
months later the doctor had seen the young man's photograph in his
wife's album, with an inscription in French: "In remembrance of the
present and in hope of the future." Later on he had met the young
man himself at his mother-in-law's. And that was at the time when
his wife had taken to being very often absent and coming home at
four or five o'clock in the morning, and was constantly asking him
to get her a passport for abroad, which he kept refusing to do; and
a continual feud went on in the house which made him feel ashamed
to face the servants.


Six months before, his colleagues had decided that he was going
into consumption, and advised him to throw up everything and go to
the Crimea. When she heard of this, Olga Dmitrievna affected to be
very much alarmed; she began to be affectionate to her husband, and
kept assuring him that it would be cold and dull in the Crimea, and
that he had much better go to Nice, and that she would go with him,
and there would nurse him, look after him, take care of him.


Now, he understood why his wife was so particularly anxious to go
to Nice: her Michel lived at Monte Carlo.


He took an English dictionary, and translating the words, and
guessing their meaning, by degrees he put together the following
sentence: "I drink to the health of my beloved darling, and kiss
her little foot a thousand times, and am impatiently expecting her
arrival." He pictured the pitiable, ludicrous part he would play
if he had agreed to go to Nice with his wife. He felt so mortified
that he almost shed tears and began pacing to and fro through all
the rooms of the flat in great agitation. His pride, his plebeian
fastidiousness, was revolted. Clenching his fists and scowling with
disgust, he wondered how he, the son of a village priest, brought
up in a clerical school, a plain, straightforward man, a surgeon
by profession--how could he have let himself be enslaved, have
sunk into such shameful bondage to this weak, worthless, mercenary,
low creature.


"'Little foot'!" he muttered to himself, crumpling up the telegram;
"'little foot'!"


Of the time when he fell in love and proposed to her, and the seven
years that he had been living with her, all that remained in his
memory was her long, fragrant hair, a mass of soft lace, and her
little feet, which certainly were very small, beautiful feet; and
even now it seemed as though he still had from those old embraces
the feeling of lace and silk upon his hands and face--and nothing
more. Nothing more--that is, not counting hysterics, shrieks,
reproaches, threats, and lies--brazen, treacherous lies. He
remembered how in his father's house in the village a bird would
sometimes chance to fly in from the open air into the house and
would struggle desperately against the window-panes and upset things;
so this woman from a class utterly alien to him had flown into his
life and made complete havoc of it. The best years of his life had
been spent as though in hell, his hopes for happiness shattered and
turned into a mockery, his health gone, his rooms as vulgar in their
atmosphere as a cocotte's, and of the ten thousand he earned every
year he could never save ten roubles to send his old mother in the
village, and his debts were already about fifteen thousand. It
seemed that if a band of brigands had been living in his rooms his
life would not have been so hopelessly, so irremediably ruined as
by the presence of this woman.


He began coughing and gasping for breath. He ought to have gone to
bed and got warm, but he could not. He kept walking about the rooms,
or sat down to the table, nervously fidgeting with a pencil and
scribbling mechanically on a paper.


"Trying a pen. . . . A little foot."


By five o'clock he grew weaker and threw all the blame on himself.
It seemed to him now that if Olga Dmitrievna had married some one
else who might have had a good influence over her--who knows?--
she might after all have become a good, straightforward woman. He
was a poor psychologist, and knew nothing of the female heart;
besides, he was churlish, uninteresting. . . .


"I haven't long to live now," he thought. "I am a dead man, and
ought not to stand in the way of the living. It would be strange
and stupid to insist upon one's rights now. I'll have it out with
her; let her go to the man she loves. . . . I'll give her a divorce.
I'll take the blame on myself."


Olga Dmitrievna came in at last, and she walked into the study and
sank into a chair just as she was in her white cloak, hat, and
overboots.


"The nasty, fat boy," she said with a sob, breathing hard. "It's
really dishonest; it's disgusting." She stamped. "I can't put up
with it; I can't, I can't!"


"What's the matter?" asked Nikolay Yevgrafitch, going up to her.


"That student, Azarbekov, was seeing me home, and he lost my bag,
and there was fifteen roubles in it. I borrowed it from mamma."


She was crying in a most genuine way, like a little girl, and not
only her handkerchief, but even her gloves, were wet with tears.


"It can't be helped!" said the doctor. "If he's lost it, he's lost
it, and it's no good worrying over it. Calm yourself; I want to
talk to you."


"I am not a millionaire to lose money like that. He says he'll pay
it back, but I don't believe him; he's poor . . ."


Her husband begged her to calm herself and to listen to him, but
she kept on talking of the student and of the fifteen roubles she
had lost.


"Ach! I'll give you twenty-five roubles to-morrow if you'll only
hold your tongue!" he said irritably.


"I must take off my things!" she said, crying. "I can't talk seriously
in my fur coat! How strange you are!"


He helped her off with her coat and overboots, detecting as he did
so the smell of the white wine she liked to drink with oysters (in
spite of her etherealness she ate and drank a great deal). She went
into her room and came back soon after, having changed her things
and powdered her face, though her eyes still showed traces of tears.
She sat down, retreating into her light, lacy dressing-gown, and
in the mass of billowy pink her husband could see nothing but her
hair, which she had let down, and her little foot wearing a slipper.


"What do you want to talk about?" she asked, swinging herself in a
rocking-chair.


"I happened to see this;" and he handed her the telegram.


She read it and shrugged her shoulders.


"Well?" she said, rocking herself faster. "That's the usual New
Year's greeting and nothing else. There are no secrets in it."


"You are reckoning on my not knowing English. No, I don't know it;
but I have a dictionary. That telegram is from Riss; he drinks to
the health of his beloved and sends you a thousand kisses. But let
us leave that," the doctor went on hurriedly. "I don't in the least
want to reproach you or make a scene. We've had scenes and reproaches
enough; it's time to make an end of them. . . . This is what I want
to say to you: you are free, and can live as you like."


There was a silence. She began crying quietly.


"I set you free from the necessity of lying and keeping up pretences,"
Nikolay Yevgrafitch continued. "If you love that young man, love
him; if you want to go abroad to him, go. You are young, healthy,
and I am a wreck, and haven't long to live. In short . . . you
understand me."


He was agitated and could not go on. Olga Dmitrievna, crying and
speaking in a voice of self-pity, acknowledged that she loved Riss,
and used to drive out of town with him and see him in his rooms,
and now she really did long to go abroad.


"You see, I hide nothing from you," she added, with a sigh. "My
whole soul lies open before you. And I beg you again, be generous,
get me a passport."


"I repeat, you are free."


She moved to another seat nearer him to look at the expression of
his face. She did not believe him and wanted now to understand his
secret meaning. She never did believe any one, and however generous
were their intentions, she always suspected some petty or ignoble
motive or selfish object in them. And when she looked searchingly
into his face, it seemed to him that there was a gleam of green
light in her eyes as in a cat's.


"When shall I get the passport?" she asked softly.


He suddenly had an impulse to say "Never"; but he restrained himself
and said:


"When you like."


"I shall only go for a month."


"You'll go to Riss for good. I'll get you a divorce, take the blame
on myself, and Riss can marry you."


"But I don't want a divorce!" Olga Dmitrievna retorted quickly,
with an astonished face. "I am not asking you for a divorce! Get
me a passport, that's all."


"But why don't you want the divorce?" asked the doctor, beginning
to feel irritated. "You are a strange woman. How strange you are!
If you are fond of him in earnest and he loves you too, in your
position you can do nothing better than get married. Can you really
hesitate between marriage and adultery?"


"I understand you," she said, walking away from him, and a spiteful,
vindictive expression came into her face. "I understand you perfectly.
You are sick of me, and you simply want to get rid of me, to force
this divorce on me. Thank you very much; I am not such a fool as
you think. I won't accept the divorce and I won't leave you--I
won't, I won't! To begin with, I don't want to lose my position in
society," she continued quickly, as though afraid of being prevented
from speaking. "Secondly, I am twenty-seven and Riss is only
twenty-three; he'll be tired of me in a year and throw me over. And
what's more, if you care to know, I'm not certain that my feeling
will last long . . . so there! I'm not going to leave you."


"Then I'll turn you out of the house!" shouted Nikolay Yevgrafitch,
stamping. "I shall turn you out, you vile, loathsome woman!"


"We shall see!" she said, and went out.


It was broad daylight outside, but the doctor still sat at the table
moving the pencil over the paper and writing mechanically.


"My dear Sir. . . . Little foot."


Or he walked about and stopped in the drawing-room before a photograph
taken seven years ago, soon after his marriage, and looked at it
for a long time. It was a family group: his father-in-law, his
mother-in-law, his wife Olga Dmitrievna when she was twenty, and
himself in the rÃ´le of a happy young husband. His father-in-law, a
clean-shaven, dropsical privy councillor, crafty and avaricious;
his mother-in-law, a stout lady with small predatory features like
a weasel, who loved her daughter to distraction and helped her in
everything; if her daughter were strangling some one, the mother
would not have protested, but would only have screened her with her
skirts. Olga Dmitrievna, too, had small predatory-looking features,
but more expressive and bolder than her mother's; she was not a
weasel, but a beast on a bigger scale! And Nikolay Yevgrafitch
himself in the photograph looked such a guileless soul, such a
kindly, good fellow, so open and simple-hearted; his whole face was
relaxed in the naÃ¯ve, good-natured smile of a divinity student, and
he had had the simplicity to believe that that company of beasts
of prey into which destiny had chanced to thrust him would give him
romance and happiness and all he had dreamed of when as a student
he used to sing the song "Youth is wasted, life is nought, when the
heart is cold and loveless."


And once more he asked himself in perplexity how he, the son of a
village priest, with his democratic bringing up--a plain, blunt,
straightforward man--could have so helplessly surrendered to the
power of this worthless, false, vulgar, petty creature, whose nature
was so utterly alien to him.


When at eleven o'clock he put on his coat to go to the hospital the
servant came into his study.


"What is it?" he asked.


"The mistress has got up and asks you for the twenty-five roubles
you promised her yesterday."




TALENT


AN artist called Yegor Savvitch, who was spending his summer holidays
at the house of an officer's widow, was sitting on his bed, given
up to the depression of morning. It was beginning to look like
autumn out of doors. Heavy, clumsy clouds covered the sky in thick
layers; there was a cold, piercing wind, and with a plaintive wail
the trees were all bending on one side. He could see the yellow
leaves whirling round in the air and on the earth. Farewell, summer!
This melancholy of nature is beautiful and poetical in its own way,
when it is looked at with the eyes of an artist, but Yegor Savvitch
was in no humour to see beauty. He was devoured by ennui and his
only consolation was the thought that by to-morrow he would not be
there. The bed, the chairs, the tables, the floor, were all heaped
up with cushions, crumpled bed-clothes, boxes. The floor had not
been swept, the cotton curtains had been taken down from the windows.
Next day he was moving, to town.


His landlady, the widow, was out. She had gone off somewhere to
hire horses and carts to move next day to town. Profiting by the
absence of her severe mamma, her daughter Katya, aged twenty, had
for a long time been sitting in the young man's room. Next day the
painter was going away, and she had a great deal to say to him. She
kept talking, talking, and yet she felt that she had not said a
tenth of what she wanted to say. With her eyes full of tears, she
gazed at his shaggy head, gazed at it with rapture and sadness. And
Yegor Savvitch was shaggy to a hideous extent, so that he looked
like a wild animal. His hair hung down to his shoulder-blades, his
beard grew from his neck, from his nostrils, from his ears; his
eyes were lost under his thick overhanging brows. It was all so
thick, so matted, that if a fly or a beetle had been caught in his
hair, it would never have found its way out of this enchanted
thicket. Yegor Savvitch listened to Katya, yawning. He was tired.
When Katya began whimpering, he looked severely at her from his
overhanging eyebrows, frowned, and said in a heavy, deep bass:


"I cannot marry."


"Why not?" Katya asked softly.


"Because for a painter, and in fact any man who lives for art,
marriage is out of the question. An artist must be free."


"But in what way should I hinder you, Yegor Savvitch?"


"I am not speaking of myself, I am speaking in general. . . . Famous
authors and painters have never married."


"And you, too, will be famous--I understand that perfectly. But
put yourself in my place. I am afraid of my mother. She is stern
and irritable. When she knows that you won't marry me, and that
it's all nothing . . . she'll begin to give it to me. Oh, how
wretched I am! And you haven't paid for your rooms, either! . . . ."


"Damn her! I'll pay."


Yegor Savvitch got up and began walking to and fro.


"I ought to be abroad!" he said. And the artist told her that nothing
was easier than to go abroad. One need do nothing but paint a picture
and sell it.


"Of course!" Katya assented. "Why haven't you painted one in the
summer?"


"Do you suppose I can work in a barn like this?" the artist said
ill-humouredly. "And where should I get models?"


Some one banged the door viciously in the storey below. Katya, who
was expecting her mother's return from minute to minute, jumped up
and ran away. The artist was left alone. For a long time he walked
to and fro, threading his way between the chairs and the piles of
untidy objects of all sorts. He heard the widow rattling the crockery
and loudly abusing the peasants who had asked her two roubles for
each cart. In his disgust Yegor Savvitch stopped before the cupboard
and stared for a long while, frowning at the decanter of vodka.


"Ah, blast you!" he heard the widow railing at Katya. "Damnation
take you!"


The artist drank a glass of vodka, and the dark cloud in his soul
gradually disappeared, and he felt as though all his inside was
smiling within him. He began dreaming. . . . His fancy pictured how
he would become great. He could not imagine his future works but
he could see distinctly how the papers would talk of him, how the
shops would sell his photographs, with what envy his friends would
look after him. He tried to picture himself in a magnificent
drawing-room surrounded by pretty and adoring women; but the picture
was misty, vague, as he had never in his life seen a drawing-room.
The pretty and adoring women were not a success either, for, except
Katya, he knew no adoring woman, not even one respectable girl.
People who know nothing about life usually picture life from books,
but Yegor Savvitch knew no books either. He had tried to read Gogol,
but had fallen asleep on the second page.


"It won't burn, drat the thing!" the widow bawled down below, as
she set the samovar. "Katya, give me some charcoal!"


The dreamy artist felt a longing to share his hopes and dreams with
some one. He went downstairs into the kitchen, where the stout widow
and Katya were busy about a dirty stove in the midst of charcoal
fumes from the samovar. There he sat down on a bench close to a big
pot and began:


"It's a fine thing to be an artist! I can go just where I like, do
what I like. One has not to work in an office or in the fields.
I've no superiors or officers over me. . . . I'm my own superior.
And with all that I'm doing good to humanity!"


And after dinner he composed himself for a "rest." He usually slept
till the twilight of evening. But this time soon after dinner he
felt that some one was pulling at his leg. Some one kept laughing
and shouting his name. He opened his eyes and saw his friend Ukleikin,
the landscape painter, who had been away all the summer in the
Kostroma district.


"Bah!" he cried, delighted. "What do I see?"


There followed handshakes, questions.


"Well, have you brought anything? I suppose you've knocked off
hundreds of sketches?" said Yegor Savvitch, watching Ukleikin taking
his belongings out of his trunk.


"H'm! . . . Yes. I have done something. And how are you getting on?
Have you been painting anything?"


Yegor Savvitch dived behind the bed, and crimson in the face,
extracted a canvas in a frame covered with dust and spider webs.


"See here. . . . A girl at the window after parting from her
betrothed. In three sittings. Not nearly finished yet."


The picture represented Katya faintly outlined sitting at an open
window, from which could be seen a garden and lilac distance.
Ukleikin did not like the picture.


"H'm! . . . There is air and . . . and there is expression," he
said. "There's a feeling of distance, but . . . but that bush is
screaming . . . screaming horribly!"


The decanter was brought on to the scene.


Towards evening Kostyliov, also a promising beginner, an historical
painter, came in to see Yegor Savvitch. He was a friend staying at
the next villa, and was a man of five-and-thirty. He had long hair,
and wore a blouse with a Shakespeare collar, and had a dignified
manner. Seeing the vodka, he frowned, complained of his chest, but
yielding to his friends' entreaties, drank a glass.


"I've thought of a subject, my friends," he began, getting drunk.
"I want to paint some new . . . Herod or Clepentian, or some
blackguard of that description, you understand, and to contrast
with him the idea of Christianity. On the one side Rome, you
understand, and on the other Christianity. . . . I want to represent
the spirit, you understand? The spirit!"


And the widow downstairs shouted continually:


"Katya, give me the cucumbers! Go to Sidorov's and get some kvass,
you jade!"


Like wolves in a cage, the three friends kept pacing to and fro
from one end of the room to the other. They talked without ceasing,
talked, hotly and genuinely; all three were excited, carried away.
To listen to them it would seem they had the future, fame, money,
in their hands. And it never occurred to either of them that time
was passing, that every day life was nearing its close, that they
had lived at other people's expense a great deal and nothing yet
was accomplished; that they were all bound by the inexorable law
by which of a hundred promising beginners only two or three rise
to any position and all the others draw blanks in the lottery,
perish playing the part of flesh for the cannon. . . . They were
gay and happy, and looked the future boldly in the face!


At one o'clock in the morning Kostyliov said good-bye, and smoothing
out his Shakespeare collar, went home. The landscape painter remained
to sleep at Yegor Savvitch's. Before going to bed, Yegor Savvitch
took a candle and made his way into the kitchen to get a drink of
water. In the dark, narrow passage Katya was sitting, on a box,
and, with her hands clasped on her knees, was looking upwards. A
blissful smile was straying on her pale, exhausted face, and her
eyes were beaming.


"Is that you? What are you thinking about?" Yegor Savvitch asked
her.


"I am thinking of how you'll be famous," she said in a half-whisper.
"I keep fancying how you'll become a famous man. . . . I overheard
all your talk. . . . I keep dreaming and dreaming. . . ."


Katya went off into a happy laugh, cried, and laid her hands
reverently on her idol's shoulders.




AN ARTIST'S STORY


I


IT was six or seven years ago when I was living in one of the
districts of the province of T----, on the estate of a young landowner
called Byelokurov, who used to get up very early, wear a peasant
tunic, drink beer in the evenings, and continually complain to me
that he never met with sympathy from any one. He lived in the lodge
in the garden, and I in the old seigniorial house, in a big room
with columns, where there was no furniture except a wide sofa on
which I used to sleep, and a table on which I used to lay out
patience. There was always, even in still weather, a droning noise
in the old Amos stoves, and in thunder-storms the whole house shook
and seemed to be cracking into pieces; and it was rather terrifying,
especially at night, when all the ten big windows were suddenly lit
up by lightning.


Condemned by destiny to perpetual idleness, I did absolutely nothing.
For hours together I gazed out of window at the sky, at the birds,
at the avenue, read everything that was brought me by post, slept.
Sometimes I went out of the house and wandered about till late in
the evening.


One day as I was returning home, I accidentally strayed into a place
I did not know. The sun was already sinking, and the shades of
evening lay across the flowering rye. Two rows of old, closely
planted, very tall fir-trees stood like two dense walls forming a
picturesque, gloomy avenue. I easily climbed over the fence and
walked along the avenue, slipping over the fir-needles which lay
two inches deep on the ground. It was still and dark, and only here
and there on the high tree-tops the vivid golden light quivered and
made rainbows in the spiders' webs. There was a strong, almost
stifling smell of resin. Then I turned into a long avenue of limes.
Here, too, all was desolation and age; last year's leaves rusted
mournfully under my feet and in the twilight shadows lurked between
the trees. From the old orchard on the right came the faint, reluctant
note of the golden oriole, who must have been old too. But at last
the limes ended. I walked by an old white house of two storeys with
a terrace, and there suddenly opened before me a view of a courtyard,
a large pond with a bathing-house, a group of green willows, and a
village on the further bank, with a high, narrow belfry on which
there glittered a cross reflecting the setting sun.


For a moment it breathed upon me the fascination of something near
and very familiar, as though I had seen that landscape at some time
in my childhood.


At the white stone gates which led from the yard to the fields,
old-fashioned solid gates with lions on them, were standing two
girls. One of them, the elder, a slim, pale, very handsome girl
with a perfect haystack of chestnut hair and a little obstinate
mouth, had a severe expression and scarcely took notice of me, while
the other, who was still very young, not more than seventeen or
eighteen, and was also slim and pale, with a large mouth and large
eyes, looked at me with astonishment as I passed by, said something
in English, and was overcome with embarrassment. And it seemed to
me that these two charming faces, too, had long been familiar to
me. And I returned home feeling as though I had had a delightful
dream.


One morning soon afterwards, as Byelokurov and I were walking near
the house, a carriage drove unexpectedly into the yard, rustling
over the grass, and in it was sitting one of those girls. It was
the elder one. She had come to ask for subscriptions for some
villagers whose cottages had been burnt down. Speaking with great
earnestness and precision, and not looking at us, she told us how
many houses in the village of Siyanovo had been burnt, how many
men, women, and children were left homeless, and what steps were
proposed, to begin with, by the Relief Committee, of which she was
now a member. After handing us the subscription list for our
signatures, she put it away and immediately began to take leave of
us.


"You have quite forgotten us, Pyotr Petrovitch," she said to
Byelokurov as she shook hands with him. "Do come, and if Monsieur
N. (she mentioned my name) cares to make the acquaintance of admirers
of his work, and will come and see us, mother and I will be delighted."


I bowed.


When she had gone Pyotr Petrovitch began to tell me about her. The
girl was, he said, of good family, and her name was Lidia Voltchaninov,
and the estate on which she lived with her mother and sister, like
the village on the other side of the pond, was called Shelkovka.
Her father had once held an important position in Moscow, and had
died with the rank of privy councillor. Although they had ample
means, the Voltchaninovs lived on their estate summer and winter
without going away. Lidia was a teacher in the Zemstvo school in
her own village, and received a salary of twenty-five roubles a
month. She spent nothing on herself but her salary, and was proud
of earning her own living.


"An interesting family," said Byelokurov. "Let us go over one day.
They will be delighted to see you."


One afternoon on a holiday we thought of the Voltchaninovs, and
went to Shelkovka to see them. They--the mother and two daughters
--were at home. The mother, Ekaterina Pavlovna, who at one time
had been handsome, but now, asthmatic, depressed, vague, and
over-feeble for her years, tried to entertain me with conversation
about painting. Having heard from her daughter that I might come
to Shelkovka, she had hurriedly recalled two or three of my landscapes
which she had seen in exhibitions in Moscow, and now asked what I
meant to express by them. Lidia, or as they called her Lida, talked
more to Byelokurov than to me. Earnest and unsmiling, she asked him
why he was not on the Zemstvo, and why he had not attended any of
its meetings.


"It's not right, Pyotr Petrovitch," she said reproachfully. "It's
not right. It's too bad."


"That's true, Lida--that's true," the mother assented. "It isn't
right."


"Our whole district is in the hands of Balagin," Lida went on,
addressing me. "He is the chairman of the Zemstvo Board, and he has
distributed all the posts in the district among his nephews and
sons-in-law; and he does as he likes. He ought to be opposed. The
young men ought to make a strong party, but you see what the young
men among us are like. It's a shame, Pyotr Petrovitch!"


The younger sister, Genya, was silent while they were talking of
the Zemstvo. She took no part in serious conversation. She was not
looked upon as quite grown up by her family, and, like a child, was
always called by the nickname of Misuce, because that was what she
had called her English governess when she was a child. She was all
the time looking at me with curiosity, and when I glanced at the
photographs in the album, she explained to me: "That's uncle . . .
that's god-father," moving her finger across the photograph. As she
did so she touched me with her shoulder like a child, and I had a
close view of her delicate, undeveloped chest, her slender shoulders,
her plait, and her thin little body tightly drawn in by her sash.


We played croquet and lawn tennis, we walked about the garden, drank
tea, and then sat a long time over supper. After the huge empty
room with columns, I felt, as it were, at home in this small snug
house where there were no oleographs on the walls and where the
servants were spoken to with civility. And everything seemed to me
young and pure, thanks to the presence of Lida and Misuce, and there
was an atmosphere of refinement over everything. At supper Lida
talked to Byelokurov again of the Zemstvo, of Balagin, and of school
libraries. She was an energetic, genuine girl, with convictions,
and it was interesting to listen to her, though she talked a great
deal and in a loud voice--perhaps because she was accustomed to
talking at school. On the other hand, Pyotr Petrovitch, who had
retained from his student days the habit of turning every conversation
into an argument, was tedious, flat, long-winded, and unmistakably
anxious to appear clever and advanced. Gesticulating, he upset a
sauce-boat with his sleeve, making a huge pool on the tablecloth,
but no one except me appeared to notice it.


It was dark and still as we went home.


"Good breeding is shown, not by not upsetting the sauce, but by not
noticing it when somebody else does," said Byelokurov, with a sigh.
"Yes, a splendid, intellectual family! I've dropped out of all
decent society; it's dreadful how I've dropped out of it! It's all
through work, work, work!"


He talked of how hard one had to work if one wanted to be a model
farmer. And I thought what a heavy, sluggish fellow he was! Whenever
he talked of anything serious he articulated "Er-er" with intense
effort, and worked just as he talked--slowly, always late and
behind-hand. I had little faith in his business capacity if only
from the fact that when I gave him letters to post he carried them
about in his pocket for weeks together.


"The hardest thing of all," he muttered as he walked beside me--
"the hardest thing of all is that, work as one may, one meets with
no sympathy from any one. No sympathy!"



II


I took to going to see the Voltchaninovs. As a rule I sat on the
lower step of the terrace; I was fretted by dissatisfaction with
myself; I was sorry at the thought of my life passing so rapidly
and uninterestingly, and felt as though I would like to tear out
of my breast the heart which had grown so heavy. And meanwhile I
heard talk on the terrace, the rustling of dresses, the pages of a
book being turned. I soon grew accustomed to the idea that during
the day Lida received patients, gave out books, and often went into
the village with a parasol and no hat, and in the evening talked
aloud of the Zemstvo and schools. This slim, handsome, invariably
austere girl, with her small well-cut mouth, always said dryly when
the conversation turned on serious subjects:


"That's of no interest to you."


She did not like me. She disliked me because I was a landscape
painter and did not in my pictures portray the privations of the
peasants, and that, as she fancied, I was indifferent to what she
put such faith in. I remember when I was travelling on the banks
of Lake Baikal, I met a Buriat girl on horseback, wearing a shirt
and trousers of blue Chinese canvas; I asked her if she would sell
me her pipe. While we talked she looked contemptuously at my European
face and hat, and in a moment she was bored with talking to me; she
shouted to her horse and galloped on. And in just the same way Lida
despised me as an alien. She never outwardly expressed her dislike
for me, but I felt it, and sitting on the lower step of the terrace,
I felt irritated, and said that doctoring peasants when one was not
a doctor was deceiving them, and that it was easy to be benevolent
when one had six thousand acres.


Meanwhile her sister Misuce had no cares, and spent her life in
complete idleness just as I did. When she got up in the morning she
immediately took up a book and sat down to read on the terrace in
a deep arm-chair, with her feet hardly touching the ground, or hid
herself with her book in the lime avenue, or walked out into the
fields. She spent the whole day reading, poring greedily over her
book, and only from the tired, dazed look in her eyes and the extreme
paleness of her face one could divine how this continual reading
exhausted her brain. When I arrived she would flush a little, leave
her book, and looking into my face with her big eyes, would tell
me eagerly of anything that had happened--for instance, that the
chimney had been on fire in the servants' hall, or that one of the
men had caught a huge fish in the pond. On ordinary days she usually
went about in a light blouse and a dark blue skirt. We went for
walks together, picked cherries for making jam, went out in the
boat. When she jumped up to reach a cherry or sculled in the boat,
her thin, weak arms showed through her transparent sleeves. Or I
painted a sketch, and she stood beside me watching rapturously.


One Sunday at the end of July I came to the Voltchaninovs about
nine o clock in the morning. I walked about the park, keeping a
good distance from the house, looking for white mushrooms, of which
there was a great number that summer, and noting their position so
as to come and pick them afterwards with Genya. There was a warm
breeze. I saw Genya and her mother both in light holiday dresses
coming home from church, Genya holding her hat in the wind. Afterwards
I heard them having tea on the terrace.


For a careless person like me, trying to find justification for my
perpetual idleness, these holiday mornings in our country-houses
in the summer have always had a particular charm. When the green
garden, still wet with dew, is all sparkling in the sun and looks
radiant with happiness, when there is a scent of mignonette and
oleander near the house, when the young people have just come back
from church and are having breakfast in the garden, all so charmingly
dressed and gay, and one knows that all these healthy, well-fed,
handsome people are going to do nothing the whole long day, one
wishes that all life were like that. Now, too, I had the same
thought, and walked about the garden prepared to walk about like
that, aimless and unoccupied, the whole day, the whole summer.


Genya came out with a basket; she had a look in her face as though
she knew she would find me in the garden, or had a presentiment of
it. We gathered mushrooms and talked, and when she asked a question
she walked a little ahead so as to see my face.


"A miracle happened in the village yesterday," she said. "The lame
woman Pelagea has been ill the whole year. No doctors or medicines
did her any good; but yesterday an old woman came and whispered
something over her, and her illness passed away."


"That's nothing much," I said. "You mustn't look for miracles only
among sick people and old women. Isn't health a miracle? And life
itself? Whatever is beyond understanding is a miracle."


"And aren't you afraid of what is beyond understanding?"


"No. Phenomena I don't understand I face boldly, and am not overwhelmed
by them. I am above them. Man ought to recognise himself as superior
to lions, tigers, stars, superior to everything in nature, even
what seems miraculous and is beyond his understanding, or else he
is not a man, but a mouse afraid of everything."


Genya believed that as an artist I knew a very great deal, and could
guess correctly what I did not know. She longed for me to initiate
her into the domain of the Eternal and the Beautiful--into that
higher world in which, as she imagined, I was quite at home. And
she talked to me of God, of the eternal life, of the miraculous.
And I, who could never admit that my self and my imagination would
be lost forever after death, answered: "Yes, men are immortal";
"Yes, there is eternal life in store for us." And she listened,
believed, and did not ask for proofs.


As we were going home she stopped suddenly and said:


"Our Lida is a remarkable person--isn't she? I love her very
dearly, and would be ready to give my life for her any minute. But
tell me"--Genya touched my sleeve with her finger--"tell me,
why do you always argue with her? Why are you irritated?"


"Because she is wrong."


Genya shook her head and tears came into her eyes.


"How incomprehensible that is!" she said. At that minute Lida had
just returned from somewhere, and standing with a whip in her hand,
a slim, beautiful figure in the sunlight, at the steps, she was
giving some orders to one of the men. Talking loudly, she hurriedly
received two or three sick villagers; then with a busy and anxious
face she walked about the rooms, opening one cupboard after another,
and went upstairs. It was a long time before they could find her
and call her to dinner, and she came in when we had finished our
soup. All these tiny details I remember with tenderness, and that
whole day I remember vividly, though nothing special happened. After
dinner Genya lay in a long arm-chair reading, while I sat upon the
bottom step of the terrace. We were silent. The whole sky was
overcast with clouds, and it began to spot with fine rain. It was
hot; the wind had dropped, and it seemed as though the day would
never end. Ekaterina Pavlovna came out on the terrace, looking
drowsy and carrying a fan.


"Oh, mother," said Genya, kissing her hand, "it's not good for you
to sleep in the day."


They adored each other. When one went into the garden, the other
would stand on the terrace, and, looking towards the trees, call
"Aa--oo, Genya!" or "Mother, where are you?" They always said their
prayers together, and had the same faith; and they understood each
other perfectly even when they did not speak. And their attitude
to people was the same. Ekaterina Pavlovna, too, grew quickly used
to me and fond of me, and when I did not come for two or three days,
sent to ask if I were well. She, too, gazed at my sketches with
enthusiasm, and with the same openness and readiness to chatter as
Misuce, she told me what had happened, and confided to me her
domestic secrets.


She had a perfect reverence for her elder daughter. Lida did not
care for endearments, she talked only of serious matters; she lived
her life apart, and to her mother and sister was as sacred and
enigmatic a person as the admiral, always sitting in his cabin, is
to the sailors.


"Our Lida is a remarkable person," the mother would often say.
"Isn't she?"


Now, too, while it was drizzling with rain, we talked of Lida.


"She is a remarkable girl," said her mother, and added in an
undertone, like a conspirator, looking about her timidly: "You
wouldn't easily find another like her; only, do you know, I am
beginning to be a little uneasy. The school, the dispensary, books
--all that's very good, but why go to extremes? She is three-and-twenty,
you know; it's time for her to think seriously of herself. With her
books and her dispensary she will find life has slipped by without
having noticed it. . . . She must be married."


Genya, pale from reading, with her hair disarranged, raised her
head and said as it were to herself, looking at her mother:


"Mother, everything is in God's hands."


And again she buried herself in her book.


Byelokurov came in his tunic and embroidered shirt. We played croquet
and tennis, then when it got dark, sat a long time over supper and
talked again about schools, and about Balagin, who had the whole
district under his thumb. As I went away from the Voltchaninovs
that evening, I carried away the impression of a long, long idle
day, with a melancholy consciousness that everything ends in this
world, however long it may be.


Genya saw us out to the gate, and perhaps because she had been with
me all day, from morning till night, I felt dull without her, and
that all that charming family were near and dear to me, and for the
first time that summer I had a yearning to paint.


"Tell me, why do you lead such a dreary, colourless life?" I asked
Byelokurov as I went home. "My life is dreary, difficult, and
monotonous because I am an artist, a strange person. From my earliest
days I've been wrung by envy, self-dissatisfaction, distrust in my
work. I'm always poor, I'm a wanderer, but you--you're a healthy,
normal man, a landowner, and a gentleman. Why do you live in such
an uninteresting way? Why do you get so little out of life? Why
haven't you, for instance, fallen in love with Lida or Genya?"


"You forget that I love another woman," answered Byelokurov.


He was referring to Liubov Ivanovna, the lady who shared the lodge
with him. Every day I saw this lady, very plump, rotund, and
dignified, not unlike a fat goose, walking about the garden, in the
Russian national dress and beads, always carrying a parasol; and
the servant was continually calling her in to dinner or to tea.
Three years before she had taken one of the lodges for a summer
holiday, and had settled down at Byelokurov's apparently forever.
She was ten years older than he was, and kept a sharp hand over
him, so much so that he had to ask her permission when he went out
of the house. She often sobbed in a deep masculine note, and then
I used to send word to her that if she did not leave off, I should
give up my rooms there; and she left off.


When we got home Byelokurov sat down on the sofa and frowned
thoughtfully, and I began walking up and down the room, conscious
of a soft emotion as though I were in love. I wanted to talk about
the Voltchaninovs.


"Lida could only fall in love with a member of the Zemstvo, as
devoted to schools and hospitals as she is," I said. "Oh, for the
sake of a girl like that one might not only go into the Zemstvo,
but even wear out iron shoes, like the girl in the fairy tale. And
Misuce? What a sweet creature she is, that Misuce!"


Byelokurov, drawling out "Er--er," began a long-winded disquisition
on the malady of the age--pessimism. He talked confidently, in a
tone that suggested that I was opposing him. Hundreds of miles of
desolate, monotonous, burnt-up steppe cannot induce such deep
depression as one man when he sits and talks, and one does not know
when he will go.


"It's not a question of pessimism or optimism," I said irritably;
"its simply that ninety-nine people out of a hundred have no sense."


Byelokurov took this as aimed at himself, was offended, and went
away.



III


"The prince is staying at Malozyomovo, and he asks to be remembered
to you," said Lida to her mother. She had just come in, and was
taking off her gloves. "He gave me a great deal of interesting news
. . . . He promised to raise the question of a medical relief centre
at Malozyomovo again at the provincial assembly, but he says there
is very little hope of it." And turning to me, she said: "Excuse
me, I always forget that this cannot be interesting to you."


I felt irritated.


"Why not interesting to me?" I said, shrugging my shoulders. "You
do not care to know my opinion, but I assure you the question has
great interest for me."


"Yes?"


"Yes. In my opinion a medical relief centre at Malozyomovo is quite
unnecessary."


My irritation infected her; she looked at me, screwing up her eyes,
and asked:


"What is necessary? Landscapes?"


"Landscapes are not, either. Nothing is."


She finished taking off her gloves, and opened the newspaper, which
had just been brought from the post. A minute later she said quietly,
evidently restraining herself:


"Last week Anna died in childbirth, and if there had been a medical
relief centre near, she would have lived. And I think even
landscape-painters ought to have some opinions on the subject."


"I have a very definite opinion on that subject, I assure you," I
answered; and she screened herself with the newspaper, as though
unwilling to listen to me. "To my mind, all these schools, dispensaries,
libraries, medical relief centres, under present conditions, only
serve to aggravate the bondage of the people. The peasants are
fettered by a great chain, and you do not break the chain, but only
add fresh links to it--that's my view of it."


She raised her eyes to me and smiled ironically, and I went on
trying to formulate my leading idea.


"What matters is not that Anna died in childbirth, but that all
these Annas, Mavras, Pelageas, toil from early morning till dark,
fall ill from working beyond their strength, all their lives tremble
for their sick and hungry children, all their lives are being
doctored, and in dread of death and disease, fade and grow old
early, and die in filth and stench. Their children begin the same
story over again as soon as they grow up, and so it goes on for
hundreds of years and milliards of men live worse than beasts--
in continual terror, for a mere crust of bread. The whole horror
of their position lies in their never having time to think of their
souls, of their image and semblance. Cold, hunger, animal terror,
a burden of toil, like avalanches of snow, block for them every way
to spiritual activity--that is, to what distinguishes man from
the brutes and what is the only thing which makes life worth living.
You go to their help with hospitals and schools, but you don't free
them from their fetters by that; on the contrary, you bind them in
closer bonds, as, by introducing new prejudices, you increase the
number of their wants, to say nothing of the fact that they've got
to pay the Zemstvo for drugs and books, and so toil harder than
ever."


"I am not going to argue with you," said Lida, putting down the
paper. "I've heard all that before. I will only say one thing: one
cannot sit with one's hands in one's lap. It's true that we are not
saving humanity, and perhaps we make a great many mistakes; but we
do what we can, and we are right. The highest and holiest task for
a civilised being is to serve his neighbours, and we try to serve
them as best we can. You don't like it, but one can't please every
one."


"That's true, Lida," said her mother--"that's true."


In Lida's presence she was always a little timid, and looked at her
nervously as she talked, afraid of saying something superfluous or
inopportune. And she never contradicted her, but always assented:
"That's true, Lida--that's true."


"Teaching the peasants to read and write, books of wretched precepts
and rhymes, and medical relief centres, cannot diminish either
ignorance or the death-rate, just as the light from your windows
cannot light up this huge garden," said I. "You give nothing. By
meddling in these people's lives you only create new wants in them,
and new demands on their labour."


"Ach! Good heavens! But one must do something!" said Lida with
vexation, and from her tone one could see that she thought my
arguments worthless and despised them.


"The people must be freed from hard physical labour," said I. "We
must lighten their yoke, let them have time to breathe, that they
may not spend all their lives at the stove, at the wash-tub, and
in the fields, but may also have time to think of their souls, of
God--may have time to develop their spiritual capacities. The
highest vocation of man is spiritual activity--the perpetual
search for truth and the meaning of life. Make coarse animal labour
unnecessary for them, let them feel themselves free, and then you
will see what a mockery these dispensaries and books are. Once a
man recognises his true vocation, he can only be satisfied by
religion, science, and art, and not by these trifles."


"Free them from labour?" laughed Lida. "But is that possible?"


"Yes. Take upon yourself a share of their labour. If all of us,
townspeople and country people, all without exception, would agree
to divide between us the labour which mankind spends on the
satisfaction of their physical needs, each of us would perhaps need
to work only for two or three hours a day. Imagine that we all,
rich and poor, work only for three hours a day, and the rest of our
time is free. Imagine further that in order to depend even less
upon our bodies and to labour less, we invent machines to replace
our work, we try to cut down our needs to the minimum. We would
harden ourselves and our children that they should not be afraid
of hunger and cold, and that we shouldn't be continually trembling
for their health like Anna, Mavra, and Pelagea. Imagine that we
don't doctor ourselves, don't keep dispensaries, tobacco factories,
distilleries--what a lot of free time would be left us after all!
All of us together would devote our leisure to science and art.
Just as the peasants sometimes work, the whole community together
mending the roads, so all of us, as a community, would search for
truth and the meaning of life, and I am convinced that the truth
would be discovered very quickly; man would escape from this
continual, agonising, oppressive dread of death, and even from death
itself."


"You contradict yourself, though," said Lida. "You talk about
science, and are yourself opposed to elementary education."


"Elementary education when a man has nothing to read but the signs
on public houses and sometimes books which he cannot understand--
such education has existed among us since the times of Rurik; Gogol's
Petrushka has been reading for ever so long, yet as the village was
in the days of Rurik so it has remained. What is needed is not
elementary education, but freedom for a wide development of spiritual
capacities. What are wanted are not schools, but universities."


"You are opposed to medicine, too."


"Yes. It would be necessary only for the study of diseases as natural
phenomena, and not for the cure of them. If one must cure, it should
not be diseases, but the causes of them. Remove the principal cause
--physical labour, and then there will be no disease. I don't
believe in a science that cures disease," I went on excitedly. "When
science and art are real, they aim not at temporary private ends,
but at eternal and universal--they seek for truth and the meaning
of life, they seek for God, for the soul, and when they are tied
down to the needs and evils of the day, to dispensaries and libraries,
they only complicate and hamper life. We have plenty of doctors,
chemists, lawyers, plenty of people can read and write, but we are
quite without biologists, mathematicians, philosophers, poets. The
whole of our intelligence, the whole of our spiritual energy, is
spent on satisfying temporary, passing needs. Scientific men,
writers, artists, are hard at work; thanks to them, the conveniences
of life are multiplied from day to day. Our physical demands increase,
yet truth is still a long way off, and man still remains the most
rapacious and dirty animal; everything is tending to the degeneration
of the majority of mankind, and the loss forever of all fitness for
life. In such conditions an artist's work has no meaning, and the
more talented he is, the stranger and the more unintelligible is
his position, as when one looks into it, it is evident that he is
working for the amusement of a rapacious and unclean animal, and
is supporting the existing order. And I don't care to work and I
won't work. . . . Nothing is any use; let the earth sink to perdition!"


"Misuce, go out of the room!" said Lida to her sister, apparently
thinking my words pernicious to the young girl.


Genya looked mournfully at her mother and sister, and went out of
the room.


"These are the charming things people say when they want to justify
their indifference," said Lida. "It is easier to disapprove of
schools and hospitals, than to teach or heal."


"That's true, Lida--that's true," the mother assented.


"You threaten to give up working," said Lida. "You evidently set a
high value on your work. Let us give up arguing; we shall never
agree, since I put the most imperfect dispensary or library of which
you have just spoken so contemptuously on a higher level than any
landscape." And turning at once to her mother, she began speaking
in quite a different tone: "The prince is very much changed, and
much thinner than when he was with us last. He is being sent to
Vichy."


She told her mother about the prince in order to avoid talking to
me. Her face glowed, and to hide her feeling she bent low over the
table as though she were short-sighted, and made a show of reading
the newspaper. My presence was disagreeable to her. I said good-bye
and went home.



IV


It was quite still out of doors; the village on the further side
of the pond was already asleep; there was not a light to be seen,
and only the stars were faintly reflected in the pond. At the gate
with the lions on it Genya was standing motionless, waiting to
escort me.


"Every one is asleep in the village," I said to her, trying to make
out her face in the darkness, and I saw her mournful dark eyes fixed
upon me. "The publican and the horse-stealers are asleep, while we,
well-bred people, argue and irritate each other."


It was a melancholy August night--melancholy because there was
already a feeling of autumn; the moon was rising behind a purple
cloud, and it shed a faint light upon the road and on the dark
fields of winter corn by the sides. From time to time a star fell.
Genya walked beside me along the road, and tried not to look at the
sky, that she might not see the falling stars, which for some reason
frightened her.


"I believe you are right," she said, shivering with the damp night
air. "If people, all together, could devote themselves to spiritual
ends, they would soon know everything."


"Of course. We are higher beings, and if we were really to recognise
the whole force of human genius and lived only for higher ends, we
should in the end become like gods. But that will never be--mankind
will degenerate till no traces of genius remain."


When the gates were out of sight, Genya stopped and shook hands
with me.


"Good-night," she said, shivering; she had nothing but her blouse
over her shoulders and was shrinking with cold. "Come to-morrow."


I felt wretched at the thought of being left alone, irritated and
dissatisfied with myself and other people; and I, too, tried not
to look at the falling stars. "Stay another minute," I said to her,
"I entreat you."


I loved Genya. I must have loved her because she met me when I came
and saw me off when I went away; because she looked at me tenderly
and enthusiastically. How touchingly beautiful were her pale face,
slender neck, slender arms, her weakness, her idleness, her reading.
And intelligence? I suspected in her intelligence above the average.
I was fascinated by the breadth of her views, perhaps because they
were different from those of the stern, handsome Lida, who disliked
me. Genya liked me, because I was an artist. I had conquered her
heart by my talent, and had a passionate desire to paint for her
sake alone; and I dreamed of her as of my little queen who with me
would possess those trees, those fields, the mists, the dawn, the
exquisite and beautiful scenery in the midst of which I had felt
myself hopelessly solitary and useless.


"Stay another minute," I begged her. "I beseech you."


I took off my overcoat and put it over her chilly shoulders; afraid
of looking ugly and absurd in a man's overcoat, she laughed, threw
it off, and at that instant I put my arms round her and covered her
face, shoulders, and hands with kisses.


"Till to-morrow," she whispered, and softly, as though afraid of
breaking upon the silence of the night, she embraced me. "We have
no secrets from one another. I must tell my mother and my sister
at once. . . . It's so dreadful! Mother is all right; mother likes
you--but Lida!"


She ran to the gates.


"Good-bye!" she called.


And then for two minutes I heard her running. I did not want to go
home, and I had nothing to go for. I stood still for a little time
hesitating, and made my way slowly back, to look once more at the
house in which she lived, the sweet, simple old house, which seemed
to be watching me from the windows of its upper storey, and
understanding all about it. I walked by the terrace, sat on the
seat by the tennis ground, in the dark under the old elm-tree, and
looked from there at the house. In the windows of the top storey
where Misuce slept there appeared a bright light, which changed to
a soft green--they had covered the lamp with the shade. Shadows
began to move. . . . I was full of tenderness, peace, and satisfaction
with myself--satisfaction at having been able to be carried away
by my feelings and having fallen in love, and at the same time I
felt uncomfortable at the thought that only a few steps away from
me, in one of the rooms of that house there was Lida, who disliked
and perhaps hated me. I went on sitting there wondering whether
Genya would come out; I listened and fancied I heard voices talking
upstairs.


About an hour passed. The green light went out, and the shadows
were no longer visible. The moon was standing high above the house,
and lighting up the sleeping garden and the paths; the dahlias and
the roses in front of the house could be seen distinctly, and looked
all the same colour. It began to grow very cold. I went out of the
garden, picked up my coat on the road, and slowly sauntered home.


When next day after dinner I went to the Voltchaninovs, the glass
door into the garden was wide open. I sat down on the terrace,
expecting Genya every minute, to appear from behind the flower-beds
on the lawn, or from one of the avenues, or that I should hear her
voice from the house. Then I walked into the drawing-room, the
dining-room. There was not a soul to be seen. From the dining-room
I walked along the long corridor to the hall and back. In this
corridor there were several doors, and through one of them I heard
the voice of Lida:


"'God . . . sent . . . a crow,'" she said in a loud, emphatic
voice, probably dictating--"'God sent a crow a piece of cheese
. . . . A crow . . . a piece of cheese.' . . . Who's there?" she
called suddenly, hearing my steps.


"It's I."


"Ah! Excuse me, I cannot come out to you this minute; I'm giving
Dasha her lesson."


"Is Ekaterina Pavlovna in the garden?"


"No, she went away with my sister this morning to our aunt in the
province of Penza. And in the winter they will probably go abroad,"
she added after a pause. "'God sent . . . the crow . . . a piece
. . . of cheese.' . . . Have you written it?"


I went into the hall, and stared vacantly at the pond and the
village, and the sound reached me of "A piece of cheese. . . . God
sent the crow a piece of cheese."


And I went back by the way I had come here for the first time--
first from the yard into the garden past the house, then into the
avenue of lime-trees. . . . At this point I was overtaken by a small
boy who gave me a note:


"I told my sister everything and she insists on my parting from
you," I read. "I could not wound her by disobeying. God will give
you happiness. Forgive me. If only you knew how bitterly my mother
and I are crying!"


Then there was the dark fir avenue, the broken-down fence. . . .
On the field where then the rye was in flower and the corncrakes
were calling, now there were cows and hobbled horses. On the slope
there were bright green patches of winter corn. A sober workaday
feeling came over me and I felt ashamed of all I had said at the
Voltchaninovs', and felt bored with life as I had been before. When
I got home, I packed and set off that evening for Petersburg.


----


I never saw the Voltchaninovs again. Not long ago, on my way to the
Crimea, I met Byelokurov in the train. As before, he was wearing a
jerkin and an embroidered shirt, and when I asked how he was, he
replied that, God be praised, he was well. We began talking. He had
sold his old estate and bought another smaller one, in the name of
Liubov Ivanovna. He could tell me little about the Voltchaninovs.
Lida, he said, was still living in Shelkovka and teaching in the
school; she had by degrees succeeded in gathering round her a circle
of people sympathetic to her who made a strong party, and at the
last election had turned out Balagin, who had till then had the
whole district under his thumb. About Genya he only told me that
she did not live at home, and that he did not know where she was.


I am beginning to forget the old house, and only sometimes when I
am painting or reading I suddenly, apropos of nothing, remember the
green light in the window, the sound of my footsteps as I walked
home through the fields in the night, with my heart full of love,
rubbing my hands in the cold. And still more rarely, at moments
when I am sad and depressed by loneliness, I have dim memories, and
little by little I begin to feel that she is thinking of me, too
--that she is waiting for me, and that we shall meet. . . .


Misuce, where are you?




THREE YEARS



I


IT was dark, and already lights had begun to gleam here and there
in the houses, and a pale moon was rising behind the barracks at
the end of the street. Laptev was sitting on a bench by the gate
waiting for the end of the evening service at the Church of St.
Peter and St. Paul. He was reckoning that Yulia Sergeyevna would
pass by on her way from the service, and then he would speak to
her, and perhaps spend the whole evening with her.


He had been sitting there for an hour and a half already, and all
that time his imagination had been busy picturing his Moscow rooms,
his Moscow friends, his man Pyotr, and his writing-table. He gazed
half wonderingly at the dark, motionless trees, and it seemed strange
to him that he was living now, not in his summer villa at Sokolniki,
but in a provincial town in a house by which a great herd of cattle
was driven every morning and evening, accompanied by terrible clouds
of dust and the blowing of a horn. He thought of long conversations
in which he had taken part quite lately in Moscow--conversations
in which it had been maintained that one could live without love,
that passionate love was an obsession, that finally there is no
such love, but only a physical attraction between the sexes--and
so on, in the same style; he remembered them and thought mournfully
that if he were asked now what love was, he could not have found
an answer.


The service was over, the people began to appear. Laptev strained
his eyes gazing at the dark figures. The bishop had been driven by
in his carriage, the bells had stopped ringing, and the red and
green lights in the belfry were one after another extinguished--
there had been an illumination, as it was dedication day--but the
people were still coming out, lingering, talking, and standing under
the windows. But at last Laptev heard a familiar voice, his heart
began beating violently, and he was overcome with despair on seeing
that Yulia Sergeyevna was not alone, but walking with two ladies.


"It's awful, awful!" he whispered, feeling jealous. "It's awful!"


At the corner of the lane, she stopped to say good-bye to the ladies,
and while doing so glanced at Laptev.


"I was coming to see you," he said. "I'm coming for a chat with
your father. Is he at home?"


"Most likely," she answered. "It's early for him to have gone to
the club."


There were gardens all along the lane, and a row of lime-trees
growing by the fence cast a broad patch of shadow in the moonlight,
so that the gate and the fences were completely plunged in darkness
on one side, from which came the sounds of women whispering, smothered
laughter, and someone playing softly on a balalaika. There was a
fragrance of lime-flowers and of hay. This fragrance and the murmur
of the unseen whispers worked upon Laptev. He was all at once
overwhelmed with a passionate longing to throw his arms round his
companion, to shower kisses on her face, her hands, her shoulders,
to burst into sobs, to fall at her feet and to tell her how long
he had been waiting for her. A faint scarcely perceptible scent of
incense hung about her; and that scent reminded him of the time
when he, too, believed in God and used to go to evening service,
and when he used to dream so much of pure romantic love. And it
seemed to him that, because this girl did not love him, all possibility
of the happiness he had dreamed of then was lost to him forever.


She began speaking sympathetically of the illness of his sister,
Nina Fyodorovna. Two months before his sister had undergone an
operation for cancer, and now every one was expecting a return of
the disease.


"I went to see her this morning," said Yulia Sergeyevna, "and it
seemed to me that during the last week she has, not exactly grown
thin, but has, as it were, faded."


"Yes, yes," Laptev agreed. "There's no return of the symptoms, but
every day I notice she grows weaker and weaker, and is wasting
before my eyes. I don't understand what's the matter with her."


"Oh dear! And how strong she used to be, plump and rosy!" said Yulia
Sergeyevna after a moment's silence. "Every one here used to call
her the Moscow lady. How she used to laugh! On holidays she used
to dress up like a peasant girl, and it suited her so well."


Doctor Sergey Borisovitch was at home; he was a stout, red-faced
man, wearing a long coat that reached below his knees, and looking
as though he had short legs. He was pacing up and down his study,
with his hands in his pockets, and humming to himself in an undertone,
"Ru-ru-ru-ru." His grey whiskers looked unkempt, and his hair was
unbrushed, as though he had just got out of bed. And his study with
pillows on the sofa, with stacks of papers in the corners, and with
a dirty invalid poodle lying under the table, produced the same
impression of unkemptness and untidiness as himself.


"M. Laptev wants to see you," his daughter said to him, going into
his study.


"Ru-ru-ru-ru," he hummed louder than ever, and turning into the
drawing-room, gave his hand to Laptev, and asked: "What good news
have you to tell me?"


It was dark in the drawing-room. Laptev, still standing with his
hat in his hand, began apologising for disturbing him; he asked
what was to be done to make his sister sleep at night, and why she
was growing so thin; and he was embarrassed by the thought that he
had asked those very questions at his visit that morning.


"Tell me," he said, "wouldn't it be as well to send for some
specialist on internal diseases from Moscow? What do you think of
it?"


The doctor sighed, shrugged his shoulders, and made a vague gesture
with his hands.


It was evident that he was offended. He was a very huffy man, prone
to take offence, and always ready to suspect that people did not
believe in him, that he was not recognised or properly respected,
that his patients exploited him, and that his colleagues showed him
ill-will. He was always jeering at himself, saying that fools like
him were only made for the public to ride rough-shod over them.


Yulia Sergeyevna lighted the lamp. She was tired out with the
service, and that was evident from her pale, exhausted face, and
her weary step. She wanted to rest. She sat down on the sofa, put
her hands on her lap, and sank into thought. Laptev knew that he
was ugly, and now he felt as though he were conscious of his ugliness
all over his body. He was short, thin, with ruddy cheeks, and his
hair had grown so thin that his head felt cold. In his expression
there was none of that refined simplicity which makes even rough,
ugly faces attractive; in the society of women, he was awkward,
over-talkative, affected. And now he almost despised himself for
it. He must talk that Yulia Sergeyevna might not be bored in his
company. But what about? About his sister's illness again?


And he began to talk about medicine, saying what is usually said.
He approved of hygiene, and said that he had long ago wanted to
found a night-refuge in Moscow--in fact, he had already calculated
the cost of it. According to his plan the workmen who came in the
evening to the night-refuge were to receive a supper of hot cabbage
soup with bread, a warm, dry bed with a rug, and a place for drying
their clothes and their boots.


Yulia Sergeyevna was usually silent in his presence, and in a strange
way, perhaps by the instinct of a lover, he divined her thoughts
and intentions. And now, from the fact that after the evening service
she had not gone to her room to change her dress and drink tea, he
deduced that she was going to pay some visit elsewhere.


"But I'm in no hurry with the night-refuge," he went on, speaking
with vexation and irritability, and addressing the doctor, who
looked at him, as it were, blankly and in perplexity, evidently
unable to understand what induced him to raise the question of
medicine and hygiene. "And most likely it will be a long time, too,
before I make use of our estimate. I fear our night-shelter will
fall into the hands of our pious humbugs and philanthropic ladies,
who always ruin any undertaking."


Yulia Sergeyevna got up and held out her hand to Laptev.


"Excuse me," she said, "it's time for me to go. Please give my love
to your sister."


"Ru-ru-ru-ru," hummed the doctor. "Ru-ru-ru-ru."


Yulia Sergeyevna went out, and after staying a little longer, Laptev
said good-bye to the doctor and went home. When a man is dissatisfied
and feels unhappy, how trivial seem to him the shapes of the
lime-trees, the shadows, the clouds, all the beauties of nature,
so complacent, so indifferent! By now the moon was high up in the
sky, and the clouds were scudding quickly below. "But how naÃ¯ve and
provincial the moon is, how threadbare and paltry the clouds!"
thought Laptev. He felt ashamed of the way he had talked just now
about medicine, and the night-refuge. He felt with horror that next
day he would not have will enough to resist trying to see her and
talk to her again, and would again be convinced that he was nothing
to her. And the day after--it would be the same. With what object?
And how and when would it all end?


At home he went in to see his sister. Nina Fyodorovna still looked
strong and gave the impression of being a well-built, vigorous
woman, but her striking pallor made her look like a corpse, especially
when, as now, she was lying on her back with her eyes closed; her
eldest daughter Sasha, a girl of ten years old, was sitting beside
her reading aloud from her reading-book.


"Alyosha has come," the invalid said softly to herself.


There had long been established between Sasha and her uncle a tacit
compact, to take turns in sitting with the patient. On this occasion
Sasha closed her reading-book, and without uttering a word, went
softly out of the room. Laptev took an historical novel from the
chest of drawers, and looking for the right page, sat down and began
reading it aloud.


Nina Fyodorovna was born in Moscow of a merchant family. She and
her two brothers had spent their childhood and early youth, living
at home in Pyatnitsky Street. Their childhood was long and wearisome;
her father treated her sternly, and had even on two or three occasions
flogged her, and her mother had had a long illness and died. The
servants were coarse, dirty, and hypocritical; the house was
frequented by priests and monks, also hypocritical; they ate and
drank and coarsely flattered her father, whom they did not like.
The boys had the good-fortune to go to school, while Nina was left
practically uneducated. All her life she wrote an illegible scrawl,
and had read nothing but historical novels. Seventeen years ago,
when she was twenty-two, on a summer holiday at Himki, she made the
acquaintance of her present husband, a landowner called Panaurov,
had fallen in love with him, and married him secretly against her
father's will. Panaurov, a handsome, rather impudent fellow, who
whistled and lighted his cigarette from the holy lamp, struck the
father as an absolutely worthless person. And when the son-in-law
began in his letters demanding a dowry, the old man wrote to his
daughter that he would send her furs, silver, and various articles
that had been left at her mother's death, as well as thirty thousand
roubles, but without his paternal blessing. Later he sent another
twenty thousand. This money, as well as the dowry, was spent; the
estate had been sold and Panaurov moved with his family to the town
and got a job in a provincial government office. In the town he
formed another tie, and had a second family, and this was the subject
of much talk, as his illicit family was not a secret.


Nina Fyodorovna adored her husband. And now, listening to the
historical novel, she was thinking how much she had gone through
in her life, how much she had suffered, and that if any one were
to describe her life it would make a very pathetic story. As the
tumour was in her breast, she was persuaded that love and her
domestic grief were the cause of her illness, and that jealousy and
tears had brought her to her hopeless state.


At last Alexey Fyodorovitch closed the book and said:


"That's the end, and thank God for it. To-morrow we'll begin a new
one."


Nina Fyodorovna laughed. She had always been given to laughter, but
of late Laptev had begun to notice that at moments her mind seemed
weakened by illness, and she would laugh at the smallest trifle,
and even without any cause at all.


"Yulia came before dinner while you were out," she said. "So far
as I can see, she hasn't much faith in her papa. 'Let papa go on
treating you,' she said, 'but write in secret to the holy elder to
pray for you, too.' There is a holy man somewhere here. Yulia forgot
her parasol here; you must take it to her to-morrow," she went on
after a brief pause. "No, when the end comes, neither doctors nor
holy men are any help."


"Nina, why can't you sleep at night?" Laptev asked, to change the
subject.


"Oh, well, I don't go to sleep--that's all. I lie and think."


"What do you think about, dear?"


"About the children, about you . . . about my life. I've gone through
a great deal, Alyosha, you know. When one begins to remember and
remember. . . . My God!" She laughed. "It's no joke to have borne
five children as I have, to have buried three. . . Sometimes I was
expecting to be confined while my Grigory Nikolaitch would be sitting
at that very time with another woman. There would be no one to send
for the doctor or the midwife. I would go into the passage or the
kitchen for the servant, and there Jews, tradesmen, moneylenders,
would be waiting for him to come home. My head used to go round
. . . . He did not love me, though he never said so openly. Now I've
grown calmer--it doesn't weigh on my heart; but in old days, when
I was younger, it hurt me--ach! how it hurt me, darling! Once--
while we were still in the country--I found him in the garden
with a lady, and I walked away. . . I walked on aimlessly, and I
don't know how, but I found myself in the church porch. I fell on
my knees: 'Queen of Heaven!' I said. And it was night, the moon was
shining. . . ."


She was exhausted, she began gasping for breath. Then, after resting
a little, she took her brother's hand and went on in a weak, toneless
voice:


"How kind you are, Alyosha! . . . And how clever! . . . What a good
man you've grown up into!"


At midnight Laptev said good-night to her, and as he went away he
took with him the parasol that Yulia Sergeyevna had forgotten. In
spite of the late hour, the servants, male and female, were drinking
tea in the dining-room. How disorderly! The children were not in
bed, but were there in the dining-room, too. They were all talking
softly in undertones, and had not noticed that the lamp was smoking
and would soon go out. All these people, big and little, were
disturbed by a whole succession of bad omens and were in an oppressed
mood. The glass in the hall had been broken, the samovar had been
buzzing every day, and, as though on purpose, was even buzzing now.
They were describing how a mouse had jumped out of Nina Fyodorovna's
boot when she was dressing. And the children were quite aware of
the terrible significance of these omens. The elder girl, Sasha, a
thin little brunette, was sitting motionless at the table, and her
face looked scared and woebegone, while the younger, Lida, a chubby
fair child of seven, stood beside her sister looking from under her
brows at the light.


Laptev went downstairs to his own rooms in the lower storey, where
under the low ceilings it was always close and smelt of geraniums.
In his sitting-room, Panaurov, Nina Fyodorovna's husband, was sitting
reading the newspaper. Laptev nodded to him and sat down opposite.
Both sat still and said nothing. They used to spend whole evenings
like this without speaking, and neither of them was in the least
put out by this silence.


The little girls came down from upstairs to say good-night.
Deliberately and in silence, Panaurov made the sign of the cross
over them several times, and gave them his hand to kiss. They dropped
curtsies, and then went up to Laptev, who had to make the sign of
the cross and give them his hand to kiss also. This ceremony with
the hand-kissing and curtsying was repeated every evening.


When the children had gone out Panaurov laid aside the newspaper
and said:


"It's not very lively in our God-fearing town! I must confess, my
dear fellow," he added with a sigh, "I'm very glad that at last
you've found some distraction."


"What do you mean?" asked Laptev.


"I saw you coming out of Dr. Byelavin's just now. I expect you don't
go there for the sake of the papa."


"Of course not," said Laptev, and he blushed.


"Well, of course not. And by the way, you wouldn't find such another
old brute as that papa if you hunted by daylight with a candle. You
can't imagine what a foul, stupid, clumsy beast he is! You cultured
people in the capitals are still interested in the provinces only
on the lyrical side, only from the _paysage_ and _Poor Anton_ point
of view, but I can assure you, my boy, there's nothing logical about
it; there's nothing but barbarism, meanness, and nastiness--that's
all. Take the local devotees of science--the local intellectuals,
so to speak. Can you imagine there are here in this town twenty-eight
doctors? They've all made their fortunes, and they are living in
houses of their own, and meanwhile the population is in just as
helpless a condition as ever. Here, Nina had to have an operation,
quite an ordinary one really, yet we were obliged to get a surgeon
from Moscow; not one doctor here would undertake it. It's beyond
all conception. They know nothing, they understand nothing. They
take no interest in anything. Ask them, for instance, what cancer
is--what it is, what it comes from."


And Panaurov began to explain what cancer was. He was a specialist
on all scientific subjects, and explained from a scientific point
of view everything that was discussed. But he explained it all in
his own way. He had a theory of his own about the circulation of
the blood, about chemistry, about astronomy. He talked slowly,
softly, convincingly.


"It's beyond all conception," he pronounced in an imploring voice,
screwing up his eyes, sighing languidly, and smiling as graciously
as a king, and it was evident that he was very well satisfied with
himself, and never gave a thought to the fact that he was fifty.


"I am rather hungry," said Laptev. "I should like something savoury."


"Well, that can easily be managed."


Not long afterwards Laptev and his brother-in-law were sitting
upstairs in the dining-room having supper. Laptev had a glass of
vodka, and then began drinking wine. Panaurov drank nothing. He
never drank, and never gambled, yet in spite of that he had squandered
all his own and his wife's property, and had accumulated debts. To
squander so much in such a short time, one must have, not passions,
but a special talent. Panaurov liked dainty fare, liked a handsome
dinner service, liked music after dinner, speeches, bowing footmen,
to whom he would carelessly fling tips of ten, even twenty-five
roubles. He always took part in all lotteries and subscriptions,
sent bouquets to ladies of his acquaintance on their birthdays,
bought cups, stands for glasses, studs, ties, walking-sticks, scents,
cigarette-holders, pipes, lap-dogs, parrots, Japanese bric-Ã -brac,
antiques; he had silk nightshirts, and a bedstead made of ebony
inlaid with mother-of-pearl. His dressing-gown was a genuine Bokhara,
and everything was to correspond; and on all this there went every
day, as he himself expressed, "a deluge" of money.


At supper he kept sighing and shaking his head.


"Yes, everything on this earth has an end," he said softly, screwing
up his dark eyes. "You will fall in love and suffer. You will fall
out of love; you'll be deceived, for there is no woman who will not
deceive; you will suffer, will be brought to despair, and will be
faithless too. But the time will come when all this will be a memory,
and when you will reason about it coldly and look upon it as utterly
trivial. . . ."


Laptev, tired, a little drunk, looked at his handsome head, his
clipped black beard, and seemed to understand why women so loved
this pampered, conceited, and physically handsome creature.


After supper Panaurov did not stay in the house, but went off to
his other lodgings. Laptev went out to see him on his way. Panaurov
was the only man in the town who wore a top-hat, and his elegant,
dandified figure, his top-hat and tan gloves, beside the grey fences,
the pitiful little houses, with their three windows and the thickets
of nettles, always made a strange and mournful impression.


After saying good-bye to him Laptev returned home without hurrying.
The moon was shining brightly; one could distinguish every straw
on the ground, and Laptev felt as though the moonlight were caressing
his bare head, as though some one were passing a feather over his
hair.


"I love!" he pronounced aloud, and he had a sudden longing to run
to overtake Panaurov, to embrace him, to forgive him, to make him
a present of a lot of money, and then to run off into the open
country, into a wood, to run on and on without looking back.


At home he saw lying on the chair the parasol Yulia Sergeyevna had
forgotten; he snatched it up and kissed it greedily. The parasol
was a silk one, no longer new, tied round with old elastic. The
handle was a cheap one, of white bone. Laptev opened it over him,
and he felt as though there were the fragrance of happiness about
him.


He settled himself more comfortably in his chair, and still keeping
hold of the parasol, began writing to Moscow to one of his friends:


"DEAR PRECIOUS KOSTYA,


"Here is news for you: I'm in love again! I say _again_, because
six years ago I fell in love with a Moscow actress, though I didn't
even succeed in making her acquaintance, and for the last year and
a half I have been living with a certain person you know--a woman
neither young nor good-looking. Ah, my dear boy, how unlucky I am
in love. I've never had any success with women, and if I say _again_
it's simply because it's rather sad and mortifying to acknowledge
even to myself that my youth has passed entirely without love, and
that I'm in love in a real sense now for the first time in my life,
at thirty-four. Let it stand that I love _again_.


"If only you knew what a girl she was! She couldn't be called a
beauty--she has a broad face, she is very thin, but what a wonderful
expression of goodness she has when she smiles! When she speaks,
her voice is as clear as a bell. She never carries on a conversation
with me--I don't know her; but when I'm beside her I feel she's
a striking, exceptional creature, full of intelligence and lofty
aspirations. She is religious, and you cannot imagine how deeply
this touches me and exalts her in my eyes. On that point I am ready
to argue with you endlessly. You may be right, to your thinking;
but, still, I love to see her praying in church. She is a provincial,
but she was educated in Moscow. She loves our Moscow; she dresses
in the Moscow style, and I love her for that--love her, love her
. . . . I see you frowning and getting up to read me a long lecture
on what love is, and what sort of woman one can love, and what sort
one cannot, and so on, and so on. But, dear Kostya, before I was
in love I, too, knew quite well what love was.


"My sister thanks you for your message. She often recalls how she
used to take Kostya Kotchevoy to the preparatory class, and never
speaks of you except as _poor Kostya_, as she still thinks of you
as the little orphan boy she remembers. And so, poor orphan, I'm
in love. While it's a secret, don't say anything to a 'certain
person.' I think it will all come right of itself, or, as the footman
says in Tolstoy, will 'come round.'"


When he had finished his letter Laptev went to bed. He was so tired
that he couldn't keep his eyes open, but for some reason he could
not get to sleep; the noise in the street seemed to prevent him.
The cattle were driven by to the blowing of a horn, and soon
afterwards the bells began ringing for early mass. At one minute a
cart drove by creaking; at the next, he heard the voice of some
woman going to market. And the sparrows twittered the whole time.



II


The next morning was a cheerful one; it was a holiday. At ten o'clock
Nina Fyodorovna, wearing a brown dress and with her hair neatly
arranged, was led into the drawing-room, supported on each side.
There she walked about a little and stood by the open window, and
her smile was broad and naÃ¯ve, and, looking at her, one recalled a
local artist, a great drunkard, who wanted her to sit to him for a
picture of the Russian carnival. And all of them--the children,
the servants, her brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and she herself--
were suddenly convinced, that she was certainly going to get well.
With shrieks of laughter the children ran after their uncle, chasing
him and catching him, and filling the house with noise.


People called to ask how she was, brought her holy bread, told her
that in almost all the churches they were offering up prayers for
her that day. She had been conspicuous for her benevolence in the
town, and was liked. She was very ready with her charity, like her
brother Alexey, who gave away his money freely, without considering
whether it was necessary to give it or not. Nina Fyodorovna used
to pay the school fees for poor children; used to give away tea,
sugar, and jam to old women; used to provide trousseaux for poor
brides; and if she picked up a newspaper, she always looked first
of all to see if there were any appeals for charity or a paragraph
about somebody's being in a destitute condition.


She was holding now in her hand a bundle of notes, by means of which
various poor people, her protÃ©gÃ©s, had procured goods from a grocer's
shop.


They had been sent her the evening before by the shopkeeper with a
request for the payment of the total--eighty-two roubles.


"My goodness, what a lot they've had! They've no conscience!" she
said, deciphering with difficulty her ugly handwriting. "It's no
joke! Eighty-two roubles! I declare I won't pay it."


"I'll pay it to-day," said Laptev.


"Why should you? Why should you?" cried Nina Fyodorovna in agitation.
"It's quite enough for me to take two hundred and fifty every month
from you and our brother. God bless you!" she added, speaking softly,
so as not to be overheard by the servants.


"Well, but I spend two thousand five hundred a month," he said. "I
tell you again, dear: you have just as much right to spend it as I
or Fyodor. Do understand that, once for all. There are three of us,
and of every three kopecks of our father's money, one belongs to
you."


But Nina Fyodorovna did not understand, and her expression looked
as though she were mentally solving some very difficult problem.
And this lack of comprehension in pecuniary matters, always made
Laptev feel uneasy and troubled. He suspected that she had private
debts in addition which worried her and of which she scrupled to
tell him.


Then came the sound of footsteps and heavy breathing; it was the
doctor coming up the stairs, dishevelled and unkempt as usual.


"Ru-ru-ru," he was humming. "Ru-ru."


To avoid meeting him, Laptev went into the dining-room, and then
went downstairs to his own room. It was clear to him that to get
on with the doctor and to drop in at his house without formalities
was impossible; and to meet the "old brute," as Panaurov called
him, was distasteful. That was why he so rarely saw Yulia. He
reflected now that the father was not at home, that if he were to
take Yulia Sergeyevna her parasol, he would be sure to find her at
home alone, and his heart ached with joy. Haste, haste!


He took the parasol and, violently agitated, flew on the wings of
love. It was hot in the street. In the big courtyard of the doctor's
house, overgrown with coarse grass and nettles, some twenty urchins
were playing ball. These were all the children of working-class
families who tenanted the three disreputable-looking lodges, which
the doctor was always meaning to have done up, though he put it off
from year to year. The yard resounded with ringing, healthy voices.
At some distance on one side, Yulia Sergeyevna was standing at her
porch, her hands folded, watching the game.


"Good-morning!" Laptev called to her.


She looked round. Usually he saw her indifferent, cold, or tired
as she had been the evening before. Now her face looked full of
life and frolic, like the faces of the boys who were playing ball.


"Look, they never play so merrily in Moscow," she said, going to
meet him. "There are no such big yards there, though; they've no
place to run there. Papa has only just gone to you," she added,
looking round at the children.


"I know; but I've not come to see him, but to see you," said Laptev,
admiring her youthfulness, which he had not noticed till then, and
seemed only that day to have discovered in her; it seemed to him
as though he were seeing her slender white neck with the gold chain
for the first time. "I've come to see you . . ." he repeated. "My
sister has sent you your parasol; you forgot it yesterday."


She put out her hand to take the parasol, but he pressed it to his
bosom and spoke passionately, without restraint, yielding again to
the sweet ecstasy he had felt the night before, sitting under the
parasol.


"I entreat you, give it me. I shall keep it in memory of you . . .
of our acquaintance. It's so wonderful!"


"Take it," she said, and blushed; "but there's nothing wonderful
about it."


He looked at her in ecstasy, in silence, not knowing what to say.


"Why am I keeping you here in the heat?" she said after a brief
pause, laughing. "Let us go indoors."


"I am not disturbing you?"


They went into the hall. Yulia Sergeyevna ran upstairs, her white
dress with blue flowers on it rustling as she went.


"I can't be disturbed," she answered, stopping on the landing. "I
never do anything. Every day is a holiday for me, from morning till
night."


"What you say is inconceivable to me," he said, going up to her.
"I grew up in a world in which every one without exception, men and
women alike, worked hard every day."


"But if one has nothing to do?" she asked.


"One has to arrange one's life under such conditions, that work is
inevitable. There can be no clean and happy life without work."


Again he pressed the parasol to his bosom, and to his own surprise
spoke softly, in a voice unlike his own:


"If you would consent to be my wife I would give everything--I
would give everything. There's no price I would not pay, no sacrifice
I would not make."


She started and looked at him with wonder and alarm.


"What are you saying!" she brought out, turning pale. "It's impossible,
I assure you. Forgive me."


Then with the same rustle of her skirts she went up higher, and
vanished through the doorway.


Laptev grasped what this meant, and his mood was transformed,
completely, abruptly, as though a light in his soul had suddenly
been extinguished. Filled with the shame of a man humiliated, of a
man who is disdained, who is not liked, who is distasteful, perhaps
disgusting, who is shunned, he walked out of the house.


"I would give everything," he thought, mimicking himself as he went
home through the heat and recalled the details of his declaration.
"I would give everything--like a regular tradesman. As though she
wanted your _everything_!"


All he had just said seemed to him repulsively stupid. Why had he
lied, saying that he had grown up in a world where every one worked,
without exception? Why had he talked to her in a lecturing tone
about a clean and happy life? It was not clever, not interesting;
it was false--false in the Moscow style. But by degrees there
followed that mood of indifference into which criminals sink after
a severe sentence. He began thinking that, thank God! everything
was at an end and that the terrible uncertainty was over; that now
there was no need to spend whole days in anticipation, in pining,
in thinking always of the same thing. Now everything was clear; he
must give up all hope of personal happiness, live without desires,
without hopes, without dreams, or expectations, and to escape that
dreary sadness which he was so sick of trying to soothe, he could
busy himself with other people's affairs, other people's happiness,
and old age would come on imperceptibly, and life would reach its
end--and nothing more was wanted. He did not care, he wished for
nothing, and could reason about it coolly, but there was a sort of
heaviness in his face especially under his eyes, his forehead felt
drawn tight like elastic--and tears were almost starting into his
eyes. Feeling weak all over, he lay down on his bed, and in five
minutes was sound asleep.



III


The proposal Laptev had made so suddenly threw Yulia Sergeyevna
into despair.


She knew Laptev very little, had made his acquaintance by chance;
he was a rich man, a partner in the well-known Moscow firm of "Fyodor
Laptev and Sons"; always serious, apparently clever, and anxious
about his sister's illness. It had seemed to her that he took no
notice of her whatever, and she did not care about him in the least
--and then all of a sudden that declaration on the stairs, that
pitiful, ecstatic face. . . .


The offer had overwhelmed her by its suddenness and by the fact
that the word wife had been uttered, and by the necessity of rejecting
it. She could not remember what she had said to Laptev, but she
still felt traces of the sudden, unpleasant feeling with which she
had rejected him. He did not attract her; he looked like a shopman;
he was not interesting; she could not have answered him except with
a refusal, and yet she felt uncomfortable, as though she had done
wrong.


"My God! without waiting to get into the room, on the stairs," she
said to herself in despair, addressing the ikon which hung over her
pillow; "and no courting beforehand, but so strangely, so
oddly. . . ."


In her solitude her agitation grew more intense every hour, and it
was beyond her strength to master this oppressive feeling alone.
She needed some one to listen to her story and to tell her that she
had done right. But she had no one to talk to. She had lost her
mother long before; she thought her father a queer man, and could
not talk to him seriously. He worried her with his whims, his extreme
readiness to take offence, and his meaningless gestures; and as
soon as one began to talk to him, he promptly turned the conversation
on himself. And in her prayer she was not perfectly open, because
she did not know for certain what she ought to pray for.


The samovar was brought in. Yulia Sergeyevna, very pale and tired,
looking dejected, came into the dining-room to make tea--it was
one of her duties--and poured out a glass for her father. Sergey
Borisovitch, in his long coat that reached below his knees, with
his red face and unkempt hair, walked up and down the room with his
hands in his pockets, pacing, not from corner to corner, but backwards
and forwards at random, like a wild beast in its cage. He would
stand still by the table, sip his glass of tea with relish, and
pace about again, lost in thought.


"Laptev made me an offer to-day," said Yulia Sergeyevna, and she
flushed crimson.


The doctor looked at her and did not seem to understand.


"Laptev?" he queried. "Panaurov's brother-in-law?"


He was fond of his daughter; it was most likely that she would
sooner or later be married, and leave him, but he tried not to think
about that. He was afraid of being alone, and for some reason
fancied, that if he were left alone in that great house, he would
have an apoplectic stroke, but he did not like to speak of this
directly.


"Well, I'm delighted to hear it," he said, shrugging his shoulders.
"I congratulate you with all my heart. It offers you a splendid
opportunity for leaving me, to your great satisfaction. And I quite
understand your feelings. To live with an old father, an invalid,
half crazy, must be very irksome at your age. I quite understand
you. And the sooner I'm laid out and in the devil's clutches, the
better every one will be pleased. I congratulate you with all my
heart."


"I refused him."


The doctor felt relieved, but he was unable to stop himself and
went on:


"I wonder, I've long wondered, why I've not yet been put into a
madhouse--why I'm still wearing this coat instead of a strait-waistcoat?
I still have faith in justice, in goodness. I am a fool, an idealist,
and nowadays that's insanity, isn't it? And how do they repay me
for my honesty? They almost throw stones at me and ride rough-shod
over me. And even my nearest kith and kin do nothing but try to get
the better of me. It's high time the devil fetched an old fool like
me. . . ."


"There's no talking to you like a rational being!" said Yulia.


She got up from the table impulsively, and went to her room in great
wrath, remembering how often her father had been unjust to her. But
a little while afterwards she felt sorry for her father, too, and
when he was going to the club she went downstairs with him, and
shut the door after him. It was a rough and stormy night; the door
shook with the violence of the wind, and there were draughts in all
directions in the passage, so that the candle was almost blown out.
In her own domain upstairs Yulia Sergeyevna went the round of all
the rooms, making the sign of the cross over every door and window;
the wind howled, and it sounded as though some one were walking on
the roof. Never had it been so dreary, never had she felt so lonely.


She asked herself whether she had done right in rejecting a man,
simply because his appearance did not attract her. It was true he
was a man she did not love, and to marry him would mean renouncing
forever her dreams, her conceptions of happiness in married life,
but would she ever meet the man of whom she dreamed, and would he
love her? She was twenty-one already. There were no eligible young
men in the town. She pictured all the men she knew--government
clerks, schoolmasters, officers, and some of them were married
already, and their domestic life was conspicuous for its dreariness
and triviality; others were uninteresting, colourless, unintelligent,
immoral. Laptev was, anyway, a Moscow man, had taken his degree at
the university, spoke French. He lived in the capital, where there
were lots of clever, noble, remarkable people; where there was noise
and bustle, splendid theatres, musical evenings, first-rate
dressmakers, confectioners. . . . In the Bible it was written that
a wife must love her husband, and great importance was given to
love in novels, but wasn't there exaggeration in it? Was it out of
the question to enter upon married life without love? It was said,
of course, that love soon passed away, and that nothing was left
but habit, and that the object of married life was not to be found
in love, nor in happiness, but in duties, such as the bringing up
of one's children, the care of one's household, and so on. And
perhaps what was meant in the Bible was love for one's husband as
one's neighbour, respect for him, charity.


At night Yulia Sergeyevna read the evening prayers attentively,
then knelt down, and pressing her hands to her bosom, gazing at the
flame of the lamp before the ikon, said with feeling:


"Give me understanding, Holy Mother, our Defender! Give me
understanding, O Lord!"


She had in the course of her life come across elderly maiden ladies,
poor and of no consequence in the world, who bitterly repented and
openly confessed their regret that they had refused suitors in the
past. Would not the same thing happen to her? Had not she better
go into a convent or become a Sister of Mercy?


She undressed and got into bed, crossing herself and crossing the
air around her. Suddenly the bell rang sharply and plaintively in
the corridor.


"Oh, my God!" she said, feeling a nervous irritation all over her
at the sound. She lay still and kept thinking how poor this provincial
life was in events, monotonous and yet not peaceful. One was
constantly having to tremble, to feel apprehensive, angry or guilty,
and in the end one's nerves were so strained, that one was afraid
to peep out of the bedclothes.


A little while afterwards the bell rang just as sharply again. The
servant must have been asleep and had not heard. Yulia Sergeyevna
lighted a candle, and feeling vexed with the servant, began with a
shiver to dress, and when she went out into the corridor, the maid
was already closing the door downstairs.


"I thought it was the master, but it's some one from a patient,"
she said.


Yulia Sergeyevna went back to her room. She took a pack of cards
out of the chest of drawers, and decided that if after shuffling
the cards well and cutting, the bottom card turned out to be a red
one, it would mean _yes_--that is, she would accept Laptev's
offer; and that if it was a black, it would mean _no_. The card
turned out to be the ten of spades.


That relieved her mind--she fell asleep; but in the morning, she
was wavering again between _yes_ and _no_, and she was dwelling on
the thought that she could, if she chose, change her life. The
thought harassed her, she felt exhausted and unwell; but yet, soon
after eleven, she dressed and went to see Nina Fyodorovna. She
wanted to see Laptev: perhaps now he would seem more attractive to
her; perhaps she had been wrong about him hitherto. . . .


She found it hard to walk against the wind. She struggled along,
holding her hat on with both hands, and could see nothing for the
dust.



IV


Going into his sister's room, and seeing to his surprise Yulia
Sergeyevna, Laptev had again the humiliating sensation of a man who
feels himself an object of repulsion. He concluded that if after
what had happened yesterday she could bring herself so easily to
visit his sister and meet him, it must be because she was not
concerned about him, and regarded him as a complete nonentity. But
when he greeted her, and with a pale face and dust under her eyes
she looked at him mournfully and remorsefully, he saw that she,
too, was miserable.


She did not feel well. She only stayed ten minutes, and began saying
good-bye. And as she went out she said to Laptev:


"Will you see me home, Alexey Fyodorovitch?"


They walked along the street in silence, holding their hats, and
he, walking a little behind, tried to screen her from the wind. In
the lane it was more sheltered, and they walked side by side.


"Forgive me if I was not nice yesterday;" and her voice quavered
as though she were going to cry. "I was so wretched! I did not sleep
all night."


"I slept well all night," said Laptev, without looking at her; "but
that doesn't mean that I was happy. My life is broken. I'm deeply
unhappy, and after your refusal yesterday I go about like a man
poisoned. The most difficult thing was said yesterday. To-day I
feel no embarrassment and can talk to you frankly. I love you more
than my sister, more than my dead mother. . . . I can live without
my sister, and without my mother, and I have lived without them,
but life without you--is meaningless to me; I can't face it. . . ."


And now too, as usual, he guessed her intention.


He realised that she wanted to go back to what had happened the day
before, and with that object had asked him to accompany her, and
now was taking him home with her. But what could she add to her
refusal? What new idea had she in her head? From everything, from
her glances, from her smile, and even from her tone, from the way
she held her head and shoulders as she walked beside him, he saw
that, as before, she did not love him, that he was a stranger to
her. What more did she want to say?


Doctor Sergey Borisovitch was at home.


"You are very welcome. I'm always glad to see you, Fyodor Alexeyitch,"
he said, mixing up his Christian name and his father's. "Delighted,
delighted!"


He had never been so polite before, and Laptev saw that he knew of
his offer; he did not like that either. He was sitting now in the
drawing-room, and the room impressed him strangely, with its poor,
common decorations, its wretched pictures, and though there were
arm-chairs in it, and a huge lamp with a shade over it, it still
looked like an uninhabited place, a huge barn, and it was obvious
that no one could feel at home in such a room, except a man like
the doctor. The next room, almost twice as large, was called the
reception-room, and in it there were only rows of chairs, as though
for a dancing class. And while Laptev was sitting in the drawing-room
talking to the doctor about his sister, he began to be tortured by
a suspicion. Had not Yulia Sergeyevna been to his sister Nina's,
and then brought him here to tell him that she would accept him?
Oh, how awful it was! But the most awful thing of all was that his
soul was capable of such a suspicion. And he imagined how the father
and the daughter had spent the evening, and perhaps the night before,
in prolonged consultation, perhaps dispute, and at last had come
to the conclusion that Yulia had acted thoughtlessly in refusing a
rich man. The words that parents use in such cases kept ringing in
his ears:


"It is true you don't love him, but think what good you could do!"


The doctor was going out to see patients. Laptev would have gone
with him, but Yulia Sergeyevna said:


"I beg you to stay."


She was distressed and dispirited, and told herself now that to
refuse an honourable, good man who loved her, simply because he was
not attractive, especially when marrying him would make it possible
for her to change her mode of life, her cheerless, monotonous, idle
life in which youth was passing with no prospect of anything better
in the future--to refuse him under such circumstances was madness,
caprice and folly, and that God might even punish her for it.


The father went out. When the sound of his steps had died away, she
suddenly stood up before Laptev and said resolutely, turning horribly
white as she did so:


"I thought for a long time yesterday, Alexey Fyodorovitch. . . . I
accept your offer."


He bent down and kissed her hand. She kissed him awkwardly on the
head with cold lips.


He felt that in this love scene the chief thing--her love--was
lacking, and that there was a great deal that was not wanted; and
he longed to cry out, to run away, to go back to Moscow at once.
But she was close to him, and she seemed to him so lovely, and he
was suddenly overcome by passion. He reflected that it was too late
for deliberation now; he embraced her passionately, and muttered
some words, calling her _thou_; he kissed her on the neck, and then
on the cheek, on the head. . . .


She walked away to the window, dismayed by these demonstrations,
and both of them were already regretting what they had said and
both were asking themselves in confusion:


"Why has this happened?"


"If only you knew how miserable I am!" she said, wringing her hands.


"What is it?" he said, going up to her, wringing his hands too. "My
dear, for God's sake, tell me--what is it? Only tell the truth,
I entreat you--nothing but the truth!"


"Don't pay any attention to it," she said, and forced herself to
smile. "I promise you I'll be a faithful, devoted wife. . . . Come
this evening."


Sitting afterwards with his sister and reading aloud an historical
novel, he recalled it all and felt wounded that his splendid, pure,
rich feeling was met with such a shallow response. He was not loved,
but his offer had been accepted--in all probability because he
was rich: that is, what was thought most of in him was what he
valued least of all in himself. It was quite possible that Yulia,
who was so pure and believed in God, had not once thought of his
money; but she did not love him--did not love him, and evidently
she had interested motives, vague, perhaps, and not fully thought
out--still, it was so. The doctor's house with its common furniture
was repulsive to him, and he looked upon the doctor himself as a
wretched, greasy miser, a sort of operatic Gaspard from "Les Cloches
de Corneville." The very name "Yulia" had a vulgar sound. He imagined
how he and his Yulia would stand at their wedding, in reality
complete strangers to one another, without a trace of feeling on
her side, just as though their marriage had been made by a professional
matchmaker; and the only consolation left him now, as commonplace
as the marriage itself, was the reflection that he was not the
first, and would not be the last; that thousands of people were
married like that; and that with time, when Yulia came to know him
better, she would perhaps grow fond of him.


"Romeo and Juliet!" he said, as he shut the novel, and he laughed.
"I am Romeo, Nina. You may congratulate me. I made an offer to Yulia
Byelavin to-day."


Nina Fyodorovna thought he was joking, but when she believed it,
she began to cry; she was not pleased at the news.


"Well, I congratulate you," she said. "But why is it so sudden?"


"No, it's not sudden. It's been going on since March, only you don't
notice anything. . . . I fell in love with her last March when I
made her acquaintance here, in your rooms."


"I thought you would marry some one in our Moscow set," said Nina
Fyodorovna after a pause. "Girls in our set are simpler. But what
matters, Alyosha, is that you should be happy--that matters most.
My Grigory Nikolaitch did not love me, and there's no concealing
it; you can see what our life is. Of course any woman may love you
for your goodness and your brains, but, you see, Yulitchka is a
girl of good family from a high-class boarding-school; goodness and
brains are not enough for her. She is young, and, you, Alyosha, are
not so young, and are not good-looking."


To soften the last words, she stroked his head and said:


"You're not good-looking, but you're a dear."


She was so agitated that a faint flush came into her cheeks, and
she began discussing eagerly whether it would be the proper thing
for her to bless Alyosha with the ikon at the wedding. She was, she
reasoned, his elder sister, and took the place of his mother; and
she kept trying to convince her dejected brother that the wedding
must be celebrated in proper style, with pomp and gaiety, so that
no one could find fault with it.


Then he began going to the Byelavins' as an accepted suitor, three
or four times a day; and now he never had time to take Sasha's place
and read aloud the historical novel. Yulia used to receive him in
her two rooms, which were at a distance from the drawing-room and
her father's study, and he liked them very much. The walls in them
were dark; in the corner stood a case of ikons; and there was a
smell of good scent and of the oil in the holy lamp. Her rooms were
at the furthest end of the house; her bedstead and dressing-table
were shut off by a screen. The doors of the bookcase were covered
on the inside with a green curtain, and there were rugs on the
floor, so that her footsteps were noiseless--and from this he
concluded that she was of a reserved character, and that she liked
a quiet, peaceful, secluded life. In her own home she was treated
as though she were not quite grown up. She had no money of her own,
and sometimes when they were out for walks together, she was overcome
with confusion at not having a farthing. Her father allowed her
very little for dress and books, hardly ten pounds a year. And,
indeed, the doctor himself had not much money in spite of his good
practice. He played cards every night at the club, and always lost.
Moreover, he bought mortgaged houses through a building society,
and let them. The tenants were irregular in paying the rent, but
he was convinced that such speculations were profitable. He had
mortgaged his own house in which he and his daughter were living,
and with the money so raised had bought a piece of waste ground,
and had already begun to build on it a large two-storey house,
meaning to mortgage it, too, as soon as it was finished.


Laptev now lived in a sort of cloud, feeling as though he were not
himself, but his double, and did many things which he would never
have brought himself to do before. He went three or four times to
the club with the doctor, had supper with him, and offered him money
for house-building. He even visited Panaurov at his other establishment.
It somehow happened that Panaurov invited him to dinner, and without
thinking, Laptev accepted. He was received by a lady of five-and-thirty.
She was tall and thin, with hair touched with grey, and black
eyebrows, apparently not Russian. There were white patches of powder
on her face. She gave him a honeyed smile and pressed his hand
jerkily, so that the bracelets on her white hands tinkled. It seemed
to Laptev that she smiled like that because she wanted to conceal
from herself and from others that she was unhappy. He also saw two
little girls, aged five and three, who had a marked likeness to
Sasha. For dinner they had milk-soup, cold veal, and chocolate. It
was insipid and not good; but the table was splendid, with gold
forks, bottles of Soyer, and cayenne pepper, an extraordinary bizarre
cruet-stand, and a gold pepper-pot.


It was only as he was finishing the milk-soup that Laptev realised
how very inappropriate it was for him to be dining there. The lady
was embarrassed, and kept smiling, showing her teeth. Panaurov
expounded didactically what being in love was, and what it was due
to.


"We have in it an example of the action of electricity," he said
in French, addressing the lady. "Every man has in his skin microscopic
glands which contain currents of electricity. If you meet with a
person whose currents are parallel with your own, then you get
love."


When Laptev went home and his sister asked him where he had been
he felt awkward, and made no answer.


He felt himself in a false position right up to the time of the
wedding. His love grew more intense every day, and Yulia seemed to
him a poetic and exalted creature; but, all the same, there was no
mutual love, and the truth was that he was buying her and she was
selling herself. Sometimes, thinking things over, he fell into
despair and asked himself: should he run away? He did not sleep for
nights together, and kept thinking how he should meet in Moscow the
lady whom he had called in his letters "a certain person," and what
attitude his father and his brother, difficult people, would take
towards his marriage and towards Yulia. He was afraid that his
father would say something rude to Yulia at their first meeting.
And something strange had happened of late to his brother Fyodor.
In his long letters he had taken to writing of the importance of
health, of the effect of illness on the mental condition, of the
meaning of religion, but not a word about Moscow or business. These
letters irritated Laptev, and he thought his brother's character
was changing for the worse.


The wedding was in September. The ceremony took place at the Church
of St. Peter and St. Paul, after mass, and the same day the young
couple set off for Moscow. When Laptev and his wife, in a black
dress with a long train, already looking not a girl but a married
woman, said good-bye to Nina Fyodorovna, the invalid's face worked,
but there was no tear in her dry eyes. She said:


"If--which God forbid--I should die, take care of my little
girls."


"Oh, I promise!" answered Yulia Sergeyevna, and her lips and eyelids
began quivering too.


"I shall come to see you in October," said Laptev, much moved. "You
must get better, my darling."


They travelled in a special compartment. Both felt depressed and
uncomfortable. She sat in the corner without taking off her hat,
and made a show of dozing, and he lay on the seat opposite, and he
was disturbed by various thoughts--of his father, of "a certain
person," whether Yulia would like her Moscow flat. And looking at
his wife, who did not love him, he wondered dejectedly "why this
had happened."



V


The Laptevs had a wholesale business in Moscow, dealing in fancy
goods: fringe, tape, trimmings, crochet cotton, buttons, and so on.
The gross receipts reached two millions a year; what the net profit
was, no one knew but the old father. The sons and the clerks estimated
the profits at approximately three hundred thousand, and said that
it would have been a hundred thousand more if the old man had not
"been too free-handed"--that is, had not allowed credit
indiscriminately. In the last ten years alone the bad debts had
mounted up to the sum of a million; and when the subject was referred
to, the senior clerk would wink slyly and deliver himself of sentences
the meaning of which was not clear to every one:


"The psychological sequences of the age."


Their chief commercial operations were conducted in the town market
in a building which was called the warehouse. The entrance to the
warehouse was in the yard, where it was always dark, and smelt of
matting and where the dray-horses were always stamping their hoofs
on the asphalt. A very humble-looking door, studded with iron, led
from the yard into a room with walls discoloured by damp and scrawled
over with charcoal, lighted up by a narrow window covered by an
iron grating. Then on the left was another room larger and cleaner
with an iron stove and a couple of chairs, though it, too, had a
prison window: this was the office, and from it a narrow stone
staircase led up to the second storey, where the principal room
was. This was rather a large room, but owing to the perpetual
darkness, the low-pitched ceiling, the piles of boxes and bales,
and the numbers of men that kept flitting to and fro in it, it made
as unpleasant an impression on a newcomer as the others. In the
offices on the top storey the goods lay in bales, in bundles and
in cardboard boxes on the shelves; there was no order nor neatness
in the arrangement of it, and if crimson threads, tassels, ends of
fringe, had not peeped out here and there from holes in the paper
parcels, no one could have guessed what was being bought and sold
here. And looking at these crumpled paper parcels and boxes, no one
would have believed that a million was being made out of such trash,
and that fifty men were employed every day in this warehouse, not
counting the buyers.


When at midday, on the day after his arrival at Moscow, Laptev went
into the warehouse, the workmen packing the goods were hammering
so loudly that in the outer room and the office no one heard him
come in. A postman he knew was coming down the stairs with a bundle
of letters in his hand; he was wincing at the noise, and he did not
notice Laptev either. The first person to meet him upstairs was his
brother Fyodor Fyodorovitch, who was so like him that they passed
for twins. This resemblance always reminded Laptev of his own
personal appearance, and now, seeing before him a short, red-faced
man with rather thin hair, with narrow plebeian hips, looking so
uninteresting and so unintellectual, he asked himself: "Can I really
look like that?"


"How glad I am to see you!" said Fyodor, kissing his brother and
pressing his hand warmly. "I have been impatiently looking forward
to seeing you every day, my dear fellow. When you wrote that you
were getting married, I was tormented with curiosity, and I've
missed you, too, brother. Only fancy, it's six months since we saw
each other. Well? How goes it? Nina's very bad? Awfully bad?"


"Awfully bad."


"It's in God's hands," sighed Fyodor. "Well, what of your wife?
She's a beauty, no doubt? I love her already. Of course, she is my
little sister now. We'll make much of her between us."


Laptev saw the broad, bent back--so familiar to him--of his
father, Fyodor Stepanovitch. The old man was sitting on a stool
near the counter, talking to a customer.


"Father, God has sent us joy!" cried Fyodor. "Brother has come!"


Fyodor Stepanovitch was a tall man of exceptionally powerful build,
so that, in spite of his wrinkles and eighty years, he still looked
a hale and vigorous man. He spoke in a deep, rich, sonorous voice,
that resounded from his broad chest as from a barrel. He wore no
beard, but a short-clipped military moustache, and smoked cigars.
As he was always too hot, he used all the year round to wear a
canvas coat at home and at the warehouse. He had lately had an
operation for cataract. His sight was bad, and he did nothing in
the business but talk to the customers and have tea and jam with
them.


Laptev bent down and kissed his head and then his lips.


"It's a good long time since we saw you, honoured sir," said the
old man--"a good long time. Well, am I to congratulate you on
entering the state of holy matrimony? Very well, then; I congratulate
you."


And he put his lips out to be kissed. Laptev bent down and kissed
him.


"Well, have you brought your young lady?" the old man asked, and
without waiting for an answer, he said, addressing the customer:
"'Herewith I beg to inform you, father, that I'm going to marry such
and such a young lady.' Yes. But as for asking for his father's
counsel or blessing, that's not in the rules nowadays. Now they go
their own way. When I married I was over forty, but I went on my
knees to my father and asked his advice. Nowadays we've none of
that."


The old man was delighted to see his son, but thought it unseemly
to show his affection or make any display of his joy. His voice and
his manner of saying "your young lady" brought back to Laptev the
depression he had always felt in the warehouse. Here every trifling
detail reminded him of the past, when he used to be flogged and put
on Lenten fare; he knew that even now boys were thrashed and punched
in the face till their noses bled, and that when those boys grew
up they would beat others. And before he had been five minutes in
the warehouse, he always felt as though he were being scolded or
punched in the face.


Fyodor slapped the customer on the shoulder and said to his brother:


"Here, Alyosha, I must introduce our Tambov benefactor, Grigory
Timofeitch. He might serve as an example for the young men of the
day; he's passed his fiftieth birthday, and he has tiny children."


The clerks laughed, and the customer, a lean old man with a pale
face, laughed too.


"Nature above the normal capacity," observed the head-clerk, who
was standing at the counter close by. "It always comes out when
it's there."


The head-clerk--a tall man of fifty, in spectacles, with a dark
beard, and a pencil behind his ear--usually expressed his ideas
vaguely in roundabout hints, while his sly smile betrayed that he
attached particular significance to his words. He liked to obscure
his utterances with bookish words, which he understood in his own
way, and many such words he used in a wrong sense. For instance,
the word "except." When he had expressed some opinion positively
and did not want to be contradicted, he would stretch out his hand
and pronounce:


"Except!"


And what was most astonishing, the customers and the other clerks
understood him perfectly. His name was Ivan Vassilitch Potchatkin,
and he came from Kashira. Now, congratulating Laptev, he expressed
himself as follows:


"It's the reward of valour, for the female heart is a strong
opponent."


Another important person in the warehouse was a clerk called
Makeitchev--a stout, solid, fair man with whiskers and a perfectly
bald head. He went up to Laptev and congratulated him respectfully
in a low voice:


"I have the honour, sir. . . The Lord has heard your parent's prayer.
Thank God."


Then the other clerks began coming up to congratulate him on his
marriage. They were all fashionably dressed, and looked like perfectly
well-bred, educated men. Since between every two words they put in
a "sir," their congratulations--something like "Best wishes, sir,
for happiness, sir," uttered very rapidly in a low voice--sounded
rather like the hiss of a whip in the air--"Shshsh-s s s s s!"
Laptev was soon bored and longing to go home, but it was awkward
to go away. He was obliged to stay at least two hours at the warehouse
to keep up appearances. He walked away from the counter and began
asking Makeitchev whether things had gone well while he was away,
and whether anything new had turned up, and the clerk answered him
respectfully, avoiding his eyes. A boy with a cropped head, wearing
a grey blouse, handed Laptev a glass of tea without a saucer; not
long afterwards another boy, passing by, stumbled over a box, and
almost fell down, and Makeitchev's face looked suddenly spiteful
and ferocious like a wild beast's, and he shouted at him:


"Keep on your feet!"


The clerks were pleased that their young master was married and had
come back at last; they looked at him with curiosity and friendly
feeling, and each one thought it his duty to say something agreeable
when he passed him. But Laptev was convinced that it was not genuine,
and that they were only flattering him because they were afraid of
him. He never could forget how fifteen years before, a clerk, who
was mentally deranged, had run out into the street with nothing on
but his shirt and shaking his fists at the windows, shouted that
he had been ill-treated; and how, when the poor fellow had recovered,
the clerks had jeered at him for long afterwards, reminding him how
he had called his employers "planters" instead of "exploiters."
Altogether the employees at Laptevs' had a very poor time of it,
and this fact was a subject of conversation for the whole market.
The worst of it was that the old man, Fyodor Stepanovitch, maintained
something of an Asiatic despotism in his attitude to them. Thus,
no one knew what wages were paid to the old man's favourites,
Potchatkin and Makeitchev. They received no more than three thousand
a year, together with bonuses, but he made out that he paid then
seven. The bonuses were given to all the clerks every year, but
privately, so that the man who got little was bound from vanity to
say he had got more. Not one boy knew when he would be promoted to
be a clerk; not one of the men knew whether his employer was satisfied
with him or not. Nothing was directly forbidden, and so the clerks
never knew what was allowed, and what was not. They were not forbidden
to marry, but they did not marry for fear of displeasing their
employer and losing their place. They were allowed to have friends
and pay visits, but the gates were shut at nine o'clock, and every
morning the old man scanned them all suspiciously, and tried to
detect any smell of vodka about them:


"Now then, breathe," he would say.


Every clerk was obliged to go to early service, and to stand in
church in such a position that the old man could see them all. The
fasts were strictly observed. On great occasions, such as the
birthday of their employer or of any member of his family, the
clerks had to subscribe and present a cake from Fley's, or an album.
The clerks lived three or four in a room in the lower storey, and
in the lodges of the house in Pyatnitsky Street, and at dinner ate
from a common bowl, though there was a plate set before each of
them. If one of the family came into the room while they were at
dinner, they all stood up.


Laptev was conscious that only, perhaps, those among them who had
been corrupted by the old man's training could seriously regard him
as their benefactor; the others must have looked on him as an enemy
and a "planter." Now, after six months' absence, he saw no change
for the better; there was indeed something new which boded nothing
good. His brother Fyodor, who had always been quiet, thoughtful,
and extremely refined, was now running about the warehouse with a
pencil behind his ear making a show of being very busy and businesslike,
slapping customers on the shoulder and shouting "Friends!" to the
clerks. Apparently he had taken up a new role, and Alexey did not
recognise him in the part.


The old man's voice boomed unceasingly. Having nothing to do, he
was laying down the law to a customer, telling him how he should
order his life and his business, always holding himself up as an
example. That boastfulness, that aggressive tone of authority,
Laptev had heard ten, fifteen, twenty years ago. The old man adored
himself; from what he said it always appeared that he had made his
wife and all her relations happy, that he had been munificent to
his children, and a benefactor to his clerks and employÃ©s, and that
every one in the street and all his acquaintances remembered him
in their prayers. Whatever he did was always right, and if things
went wrong with people it was because they did not take his advice;
without his advice nothing could succeed. In church he stood in the
foremost place, and even made observations to the priests, if in
his opinion they were not conducting the service properly, and
believed that this was pleasing God because God loved him.


At two o'clock every one in the warehouse was hard at work, except
the old man, who still went on booming in his deep voice. To avoid
standing idle, Laptev took some trimmings from a workgirl and let
her go; then listened to a customer, a merchant from Vologda, and
told a clerk to attend to him.


"T. V. A.!" resounded on all sides (prices were denoted by letters
in the warehouse and goods by numbers). "R. I. T.!" As he went away,
Laptev said good-bye to no one but Fyodor.


"I shall come to Pyatnitsky Street with my wife to-morrow," he said;
"but I warn you, if father says a single rude thing to her, I shall
not stay there another minute."


"You're the same as ever," sighed Fyodor. "Marriage has not changed
you. You must be patient with the old man. So till eleven o'clock,
then. We shall expect you impatiently. Come directly after mass,
then."


"I don't go to mass."


"That does not matter. The great thing is not to be later than
eleven, so you may be in time to pray to God and to lunch with us.
Give my greetings to my little sister and kiss her hand for me. I
have a presentiment that I shall like her," Fyodor added with perfect
sincerity. "I envy you, brother!" he shouted after him as Alexey
went downstairs.


"And why does he shrink into himself in that shy way as though he
fancied he was naked?" thought Laptev, as he walked along Nikolsky
Street, trying to understand the change that had come over his
brother. "And his language is new, too: 'Brother, dear brother, God
has sent us joy; to pray to God'--just like Iudushka in Shtchedrin."

At eleven o'clock the next day, which was Sunday, he was driving
with his wife along Pyatnitsky Street in a light, one-horse carriage.
He was afraid of his father's doing something outrageous, and was
already ill at ease. After two nights in her husband's house Yulia
Sergeyevna considered her marriage a mistake and a calamity, and
if she had had to live with her husband in any other town but Moscow,
it seemed to her that she could not have endured the horror of it.
Moscow entertained her--she was delighted with the streets, the
churches; and if it had been possible to drive about Moscow in those
splendid sledges with expensive horses, to drive the whole day from
morning till night, and with the swift motion to feel the cold
autumn air blowing upon her, she would perhaps not have felt herself
so unhappy.


Near a white, lately stuccoed two-storey house the coachman pulled
up his horse, and began to turn to the right. They were expected,
and near the gate stood two policemen and the porter in a new
full-skirted coat, high boots, and goloshes. The whole space, from
the middle of the street to the gates and all over the yard from
the porch, was strewn with fresh sand. The porter took off his hat,
the policemen saluted. Near the entrance Fyodor met them with a
very serious face.


"Very glad to make your acquaintance, little sister," he said,
kissing Yulia's hand. "You're very welcome."


He led her upstairs on his arm, and then along a corridor through
a crowd of men and women. The anteroom was crowded too, and smelt
of incense.


"I will introduce you to our father directly," whispered Fyodor in
the midst of a solemn, deathly silence. "A venerable old man,
_pater-familias_."


In the big drawing-room, by a table prepared for service, Fyodor
Stepanovitch stood, evidently waiting for them, and with him the
priest in a calotte, and a deacon. The old man shook hands with
Yulia without saying a word. Every one was silent. Yulia was overcome
with confusion.


The priest and the deacon began putting on their vestments. A censer
was brought in, giving off sparks and fumes of incense and charcoal.
The candles were lighted. The clerks walked into the drawing-room
on tiptoe and stood in two rows along the wall. There was perfect
stillness, no one even coughed.


"The blessing of God," began the deacon. The service was read with
great solemnity; nothing was left out and two canticles were sung
--to sweetest Jesus and the most Holy Mother of God. The singers
sang very slowly, holding up the music before them. Laptev noticed
how confused his wife was. While they were singing the canticles,
and the singers in different keys brought out "Lord have mercy on
us," he kept expecting in nervous suspense that the old man would
make some remark such as, "You don't know how to cross yourself,"
and he felt vexed. Why this crowd, and why this ceremony with priests
and choristers? It was too bourgeois. But when she, like the old
man, put her head under the gospel and afterwards several times
dropped upon her knees, he realised that she liked it all, and was
reassured.


At the end of the service, during "Many, many years," the priest
gave the old man and Alexey the cross to kiss, but when Yulia went
up, he put his hand over the cross, and showed he wanted to speak.
Signs were made to the singers to stop.


"The prophet Samuel," began the priest, "went to Bethlehem at the
bidding of the Lord, and there the elders of the town with fear and
trembling asked him: 'Comest thou peaceably?' And the prophet
answered: 'Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord: sanctify
yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.' Even so, Yulia,
servant of God, shall we ask of thee, Dost thou come bringing peace
into this house?"


Yulia flushed with emotion. As he finished, the priest gave her the
cross to kiss, and said in quite a different tone of voice:


"Now Fyodor Fyodorovitch must be married; it's high time."


The choir began singing once more, people began moving, and the
room was noisy again. The old man, much touched, with his eyes full
of tears, kissed Yulia three times, made the sign of the cross over
her face, and said:


"This is your home. I'm an old man and need nothing."


The clerks congratulated her and said something, but the choir was
singing so loud that nothing else could be heard. Then they had
lunch and drank champagne. She sat beside the old father, and he
talked to her, saying that families ought not to be parted but live
together in one house; that separation and disunion led to permanent
rupture.


"I've made money and the children only do the spending of it," he
said. "Now, you live with me and save money. It's time for an old
man like me to rest."


Yulia had all the time a vision of Fyodor flitting about so like
her husband, but shyer and more restless; he fussed about her and
often kissed her hand.


"We are plain people, little sister," he said, and patches of red
came into his face as he spoke. "We live simply in Russian style,
like Christians, little sister."


As they went home, Laptev felt greatly relieved that everything had
gone off so well, and that nothing outrageous had happened as he
had expected. He said to his wife:


"You're surprised that such a stalwart, broad-shouldered father
should have such stunted, narrow-chested sons as Fyodor and me.
Yes; but it's easy to explain! My father married my mother when he
was forty-five, and she was only seventeen. She turned pale and
trembled in his presence. Nina was born first--born of a comparatively
healthy mother, and so she was finer and sturdier than we were.
Fyodor and I were begotten and born after mother had been worn out
by terror. I can remember my father correcting me--or, to speak
plainly, beating me--before I was five years old. He used to
thrash me with a birch, pull my ears, hit me on the head, and every
morning when I woke up my first thought was whether he would beat
me that day. Play and childish mischief was forbidden us. We had
to go to morning service and to early mass. When we met priests or
monks we had to kiss their hands; at home we had to sing hymns.
Here you are religious and love all that, but I'm afraid of religion,
and when I pass a church I remember my childhood, and am overcome
with horror. I was taken to the warehouse as soon as I was eight
years old. I worked like a working boy, and it was bad for my health,
for I used to be beaten there every day. Afterwards when I went to
the high school, I used to go to school till dinner-time, and after
dinner I had to sit in that warehouse till evening; and things went
on like that till I was twenty-two, till I got to know Yartsev, and
he persuaded me to leave my father's house. That Yartsev did a great
deal for me. I tell you what," said Laptev, and he laughed with
pleasure: "let us go and pay Yartsev a visit at once. He's a very
fine fellow! How touched he will be!"



VII


On a Saturday in November Anton Rubinstein was conducting in a
symphony concert. It was very hot and crowded. Laptev stood behind
the columns, while his wife and Kostya Kotchevoy were sitting in
the third or fourth row some distance in front. At the very beginning
of an interval a "certain person," Polina Nikolaevna Razsudin, quite
unexpectedly passed by him. He had often since his marriage thought
with trepidation of a possible meeting with her. When now she looked
at him openly and directly, he realised that he had all this time
shirked having things out with her, or writing her two or three
friendly lines, as though he had been hiding from her; he felt
ashamed and flushed crimson. She pressed his hand tightly and
impulsively and asked:


"Have you seen Yartsev?"


And without waiting for an answer she went striding on impetuously
as though some one were pushing her on from behind.


She was very thin and plain, with a long nose; her face always
looked tired, and exhausted, and it seemed as though it were an
effort to her to keep her eyes open, and not to fall down. She had
fine, dark eyes, and an intelligent, kind, sincere expression, but
her movements were awkward and abrupt. It was hard to talk to her,
because she could not talk or listen quietly. Loving her was not
easy. Sometimes when she was alone with Laptev she would go on
laughing for a long time, hiding her face in her hands, and would
declare that love was not the chief thing in life for her, and would
be as whimsical as a girl of seventeen; and before kissing her he
would have to put out all the candles. She was thirty. She was
married to a schoolmaster, but had not lived with her husband for
years. She earned her living by giving music lessons and playing
in quartettes.


During the ninth symphony she passed again as though by accident,
but the crowd of men standing like a thick wall behind the columns
prevented her going further, and she remained beside him. Laptev
saw that she was wearing the same little velvet blouse she had worn
at concerts last year and the year before. Her gloves were new, and
her fan, too, was new, but it was a common one. She was fond of
fine clothes, but she did not know how to dress, and grudged spending
money on it. She dressed so badly and untidily that when she was
going to her lessons striding hurriedly down the street, she might
easily have been taken for a young monk.


The public applauded and shouted encore.


"You'll spend the evening with me," said Polina Nikolaevna, going
up to Laptev and looking at him severely. "When this is over we'll
go and have tea. Do you hear? I insist on it. You owe me a great
deal, and haven't the moral right to refuse me such a trifle."


"Very well; let us go," Laptev assented.


Endless calls followed the conclusion of the concert. The audience
got up from their seats and went out very slowly, and Laptev could
not go away without telling his wife. He had to stand at the door
and wait.


"I'm dying for some tea," Polina Nikolaevna said plaintively. "My
very soul is parched."


"You can get something to drink here," said Laptev. "Let's go to
the buffet."


"Oh, I've no money to fling away on waiters. I'm not a shopkeeper."


He offered her his arm; she refused, in a long, wearisome sentence
which he had heard many times, to the effect that she did not class
herself with the feebler fair sex, and did not depend on the services
of gentlemen.


As she talked to him she kept looking about at the audience and
greeting acquaintances; they were her fellow-students at the higher
courses and at the conservatorium, and her pupils. She gripped their
hands abruptly, as though she were tugging at them. But then she
began twitching her shoulders, and trembling as though she were in
a fever, and at last said softly, looking at Laptev with horror:


"Who is it you've married? Where were your eyes, you mad fellow?
What did you see in that stupid, insignificant girl? Why, I loved
you for your mind, for your soul, but that china doll wants nothing
but your money!"


"Let us drop that, Polina," he said in a voice of supplication.
"All that you can say to me about my marriage I've said to myself
many times already. Don't cause me unnecessary pain."


Yulia Sergeyevna made her appearance, wearing a black dress with a
big diamond brooch, which her father-in-law had sent her after the
service. She was followed by her suite--Kotchevoy, two doctors
of their acquaintance, an officer, and a stout young man in student's
uniform, called Kish.


"You go on with Kostya," Laptev said to his wife. "I'm coming later."


Yulia nodded and went on. Polina Nikolaevna gazed after her, quivering
all over and twitching nervously, and in her eyes there was a look
of repulsion, hatred, and pain.


Laptev was afraid to go home with her, foreseeing an unpleasant
discussion, cutting words, and tears, and he suggested that they
should go and have tea at a restaurant. But she said:


"No, no. I want to go home. Don't dare to talk to me of restaurants."


She did not like being in a restaurant, because the atmosphere of
restaurants seemed to her poisoned by tobacco smoke and the breath
of men. Against all men she did not know she cherished a strange
prejudice, regarding them all as immoral rakes, capable of attacking
her at any moment. Besides, the music played at restaurants jarred
on her nerves and gave her a headache.


Coming out of the Hall of Nobility, they took a sledge in Ostozhenka
and drove to Savelovsky Lane, where she lodged. All the way Laptev
thought about her. It was true that he owed her a great deal. He
had made her acquaintance at the flat of his friend Yartsev, to
whom she was giving lessons in harmony. Her love for him was deep
and perfectly disinterested, and her relations with him did not
alter her habits; she went on giving her lessons and wearing herself
out with work as before. Through her he came to understand and love
music, which he had scarcely cared for till then.


"Half my kingdom for a cup of tea!" she pronounced in a hollow
voice, covering her mouth with her muff that she might not catch
cold. "I've given five lessons, confound them! My pupils are as
stupid as posts; I nearly died of exasperation. I don't know how
long this slavery can go on. I'm worn out. As soon as I can scrape
together three hundred roubles, I shall throw it all up and go to
the Crimea, to lie on the beach and drink in ozone. How I love the
sea--oh, how I love the sea!"


"You'll never go," said Laptev. "To begin with, you'll never save
the money; and, besides, you'd grudge spending it. Forgive me, I
repeat again: surely it's quite as humiliating to collect the money
by farthings from idle people who have music lessons to while away
their time, as to borrow it from your friends."


"I haven't any friends," she said irritably. "And please don't talk
nonsense. The working class to which I belong has one privilege:
the consciousness of being incorruptible--the right to refuse to
be indebted to wretched little shopkeepers, and to treat them with
scorn. No, indeed, you don't buy me! I'm not a Yulitchka!"


Laptev did not attempt to pay the driver, knowing that it would
call forth a perfect torrent of words, such as he had often heard
before. She paid herself.


She had a little furnished room in the flat of a solitary lady who
provided her meals. Her big Becker piano was for the time at Yartsev's
in Great Nikitsky Street, and she went there every day to play on
it. In her room there were armchairs in loose covers, a bed with a
white summer quilt, and flowers belonging to the landlady; there
were oleographs on the walls, and there was nothing that would have
suggested that there was a woman, and a woman of university education,
living in it. There was no toilet table; there were no books; there
was not even a writing-table. It was evident that she went to bed
as soon as she got home, and went out as soon as she got up in the
morning.


The cook brought in the samovar. Polina Nikolaevna made tea, and,
still shivering--the room was cold--began abusing the singers
who had sung in the ninth symphony. She was so tired she could
hardly keep her eyes open. She drank one glass of tea, then a second,
and then a third.


"And so you are married," she said. "But don't be uneasy; I'm not
going to pine away. I shall be able to tear you out of my heart.
Only it's annoying and bitter to me that you are just as contemptible
as every one else; that what you want in a woman is not brains or
intellect, but simply a body, good looks, and youth. . . . Youth!"
she pronounced through her nose, as though mimicking some one, and
she laughed. "Youth! You must have purity, _reinheit! reinheit!_"
she laughed, throwing herself back in her chair. "_Reinheit!_"


When she left off laughing her eyes were wet with tears.


"You're happy, at any rate?" she asked.


"No."


"Does she love you?"


Laptev, agitated, and feeling miserable, stood up and began walking
about the room.


"No," he repeated. "If you want to know, Polina, I'm very unhappy.
There's no help for it; I've done the stupid thing, and there's no
correcting it now. I must look at it philosophically. She married
me without love, stupidly, perhaps with mercenary motives, but
without understanding, and now she evidently sees her mistake and
is miserable. I see it. At night we sleep together, but by day she
is afraid to be left alone with me for five minutes, and tries to
find distraction, society. With me she feels ashamed and frightened."


"And yet she takes money from you?"


"That's stupid, Polina!" cried Laptev. "She takes money from me
because it makes absolutely no difference to her whether she has
it or not. She is an honest, pure girl. She married me simply because
she wanted to get away from her father, that's all."


"And are you sure she would have married you if you had not been
rich?" asked Polina.


"I'm not sure of anything," said Laptev dejectedly. "Not of anything.
I don't understand anything. For God's sake, Polina, don't let us
talk about it."


"Do you love her?"


"Desperately."


A silence followed. She drank a fourth glass, while he paced up and
down, thinking that by now his wife was probably having supper at
the doctors' club.


"But is it possible to love without knowing why?" asked Polina,
shrugging her shoulders. "No; it's the promptings of animal passion!
You are poisoned, intoxicated by that beautiful body, that _reinheit!_
Go away from me; you are unclean! Go to her!"


She brandished her hand at him, then took up his hat and hurled it
at him. He put on his fur coat without speaking and went out, but
she ran after him into the passage, clutched his arm above the
elbow, and broke into sobs.


"Hush, Polina! Don't!" he said, and could not unclasp her fingers.
"Calm yourself, I entreat you."


She shut her eyes and turned pale, and her long nose became an
unpleasant waxy colour like a corpse's, and Laptev still could not
unclasp her fingers. She had fainted. He lifted her up carefully,
laid her on her bed, and sat by her for ten minutes till she came
to herself. Her hands were cold, her pulse was weak and uneven.


"Go home," she said, opening her eyes. "Go away, or I shall begin
howling again. I must take myself in hand."


When he came out, instead of going to the doctors' club where his
friends were expecting him, he went home. All the way home he was
asking himself reproachfully why he had not settled down to married
life with that woman who loved him so much, and was in reality his
wife and friend. She was the one human being who was devoted to
him; and, besides, would it not have been a grateful and worthy
task to give happiness, peace, and a home to that proud, clever,
overworked creature? Was it for him, he asked himself, to lay claim
to youth and beauty, to that happiness which could not be, and
which, as though in punishment or mockery, had kept him for the
last three months in a state of gloom and oppression. The honeymoon
was long over, and he still, absurd to say, did not know what sort
of person his wife was. To her school friends and her father she
wrote long letters of five sheets, and was never at a loss for
something to say to them, but to him she never spoke except about
the weather or to tell him that dinner was ready, or that it was
supper-time. When at night she said her lengthy prayers and then
kissed her crosses and ikons, he thought, watching her with hatred,
"Here she's praying. What's she praying about? What about?" In his
thoughts he showered insults on himself and her, telling himself
that when he got into bed and took her into his arms, he was taking
what he had paid for; but it was horrible. If only it had been a
healthy, reckless, sinful woman; but here he had youth, piety,
meekness, the pure eyes of innocence. . . . While they were engaged
her piety had touched him; now the conventional definiteness of her
views and convictions seemed to him a barrier, behind which the
real truth could not be seen. Already everything in his married
life was agonising. When his wife, sitting beside him in the theatre,
sighed or laughed spontaneously, it was bitter to him that she
enjoyed herself alone and would not share her delight with him. And
it was remarkable that she was friendly with all his friends, and
they all knew what she was like already, while he knew nothing about
her, and only moped and was dumbly jealous.


When he got home Laptev put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and
sat down in his study to read a novel. His wife was not at home.
But within half an hour there was a ring at the hall door, and he
heard the muffled footsteps of Pyotr running to open it. It was
Yulia. She walked into the study in her fur coat, her cheeks rosy
with the frost,


"There's a great fire in Pryesnya," she said breathlessly. "There's
a tremendous glow. I'm going to see it with Konstantin Ivanovitch."


"Well, do, dear!"


The sight of her health, her freshness, and the childish horror in
her eyes, reassured Laptev. He read for another half-hour and went
to bed.


Next day Polina Nikolaevna sent to the warehouse two books she had
borrowed from him, all his letters and his photographs; with them
was a note consisting of one word--_"basta."_



VIII


Towards the end of October Nina Fyodorovna had unmistakable symptoms
of a relapse. There was a change in her face, and she grew rapidly
thinner. In spite of acute pain she still imagined that she was
getting better, and got up and dressed every morning as though she
were well, and then lay on her bed, fully dressed, for the rest of
the day. And towards the end she became very talkative. She would
lie on her back and talk in a low voice, speaking with an effort
and breathing painfully. She died suddenly under the following
circumstances.


It was a clear moonlight evening. In the street people were tobogganing
in the fresh snow, and their clamour floated in at the window. Nina
Fyodorovna was lying on her back in bed, and Sasha, who had no one
to take turns with her now, was sitting beside her half asleep.


"I don't remember his father's name," Nina Fyodorovna was saying
softly, "but his name was Ivan Kotchevoy--a poor clerk. He was a
sad drunkard, the Kingdom of Heaven be his! He used to come to us,
and every month we used to give him a pound of sugar and two ounces
of tea. And money, too, sometimes, of course. Yes. . . . And then,
this is what happened. Our Kotchevoy began drinking heavily and
died, consumed by vodka. He left a little son, a boy of seven. Poor
little orphan! . . . We took him and hid him in the clerk's quarters,
and he lived there for a whole year, without father's knowing. And
when father did see him, he only waved his hand and said nothing.
When Kostya, the little orphan, was nine years old--by that time
I was engaged to be married--I took him round to all the day
schools. I went from one to the other, and no one would take him.
And he cried. . . . 'What are you crying for, little silly?' I said.
I took him to Razgulyay to the second school, where--God bless
them for it!--they took him, and the boy began going every day
on foot from Pyatnitsky Street to Razgulyay Street and back again
. . . . Alyosha paid for him. . . . By God's grace the boy got on,
was good at his lessons, and turned out well. . . . He's a lawyer
now in Moscow, a friend of Alyosha's, and so good in science. Yes,
we had compassion on a fellow-creature and took him into our house,
and now I daresay, he remembers us in his prayers. . . Yes. . . ."


Nina Fyodorovna spoke more and more slowly with long pauses, then
after a brief silence she suddenly raised herself and sat up.


"There's something the matter with me . . . something seems wrong,"
she said. "Lord have mercy on me! Oh, I can't breathe!"


Sasha knew that her mother would soon die; seeing now how suddenly
her face looked drawn, she guessed that it was the end, and she was
frightened.


"Mother, you mustn't!" she began sobbing. "You mustn't."


"Run to the kitchen; let them go for father. I am very ill indeed."


Sasha ran through all the rooms calling, but there were none of the
servants in the house, and the only person she found was Lida asleep
on a chest in the dining-room with her clothes on and without a
pillow. Sasha ran into the yard just as she was without her goloshes,
and then into the street. On a bench at the gate her nurse was
sitting watching the tobogganing. From beyond the river, where the
tobogganing slope was, came the strains of a military band.


"Nurse, mother's dying!" sobbed Sasha. "You must go for father! . . ."


The nurse went upstairs, and, glancing at the sick woman, thrust a
lighted wax candle into her hand. Sasha rushed about in terror and
besought some one to go for her father, then she put on a coat and
a kerchief, and ran into the street. From the servants she knew
already that her father had another wife and two children with whom
he lived in Bazarny Street. She ran out of the gate and turned to
the left, crying, and frightened of unknown people. She soon began
to sink into the snow and grew numb with cold.


She met an empty sledge, but she did not take it: perhaps, she
thought, the man would drive her out of town, rob her, and throw
her into the cemetery (the servants had talked of such a case at
tea). She went on and on, sobbing and panting with exhaustion. When
she got into Bazarny Street, she inquired where M. Panaurov lived.
An unknown woman spent a long time directing her, and seeing that
she did not understand, took her by the hand and led her to a house
of one storey that stood back from the street. The door stood open.
Sasha ran through the entry, along the corridor, and found herself
at last in a warm, lighted room where her father was sitting by the
samovar with a lady and two children. But by now she was unable to
utter a word, and could only sob. Panaurov understood.


"Mother's worse?" he asked. "Tell me, child: is mother worse?"


He was alarmed and sent for a sledge.


When they got home, Nina Fyodorovna was sitting propped up with
pillows, with a candle in her hand. Her face looked dark and her
eyes were closed. Crowding in the doorway stood the nurse, the cook,
the housemaid, a peasant called Prokofy and a few persons of the
humbler class, who were complete strangers. The nurse was giving
them orders in a whisper, and they did not understand. Inside the
room at the window stood Lida, with a pale and sleepy face, gazing
severely at her mother.


Panaurov took the candle out of Nina Fyodorovna's hand, and, frowning
contemptuously, flung it on the chest of drawers.


"This is awful!" he said, and his shoulders quivered. "Nina, you
must lie down," he said affectionately. "Lie down, dear."


She looked at him, but did not know him. They laid her down on her
back.


When the priest and the doctor, Sergey Borisovitch, arrived, the
servants crossed themselves devoutly and prayed for her.


"What a sad business!" said the doctor thoughtfully, coming out
into the drawing-room. "Why, she was still young--not yet forty."


They heard the loud sobbing of the little girls. Panaurov, with a
pale face and moist eyes, went up to the doctor and said in a faint,
weak voice:


"Do me a favour, my dear fellow. Send a telegram to Moscow. I'm not
equal to it."


The doctor fetched the ink and wrote the following telegram to his
daughter:


"Madame Panaurov died at eight o'clock this evening. Tell your
husband: a mortgaged house for sale in Dvoryansky Street, nine
thousand cash. Auction on twelfth. Advise him not miss opportunity."



IX


Laptev lived in one of the turnings out of Little Dmitrovka. Besides
the big house facing the street, he rented also a two-storey lodge
in the yard at the back of his friend Kotchevoy, a lawyer's assistant
whom all the Laptevs called Kostya, because he had grown up under
their eyes. Facing this lodge stood another, also of two storeys,
inhabited by a French family consisting of a husband and wife and
five daughters.


There was a frost of twenty degrees. The windows were frozen over.
Waking up in the morning, Kostya, with an anxious face, took twenty
drops of a medicine; then, taking two dumb-bells out of the bookcase,
he did gymnastic exercises. He was tall and thin, with big reddish
moustaches; but what was most noticeable in his appearance was the
length of his legs.


Pyotr, a middle-aged peasant in a reefer jacket and cotton breeches
tucked into his high boots, brought in the samovar and made the
tea.


"It's very nice weather now, Konstantin Ivanovitch," he said.


"It is, but I tell you what, brother, it's a pity we can't get on,
you and I, without such exclamations."


Pyotr sighed from politeness.


"What are the little girls doing?" asked Kotchevoy.


"The priest has not come. Alexey Fyodorovitch is giving them their
lesson himself."


Kostya found a spot in the window that was not covered with frost,
and began looking through a field-glass at the windows of the house
where the French family lived.


"There's no seeing," he said.


Meanwhile Alexey Fyodorovitch was giving Sasha and Lida a scripture
lesson below. For the last six weeks they had been living in Moscow,
and were installed with their governess in the lower storey of the
lodge. And three times a week a teacher from a school in the town,
and a priest, came to give them lessons. Sasha was going through
the New Testament and Lida was going through the Old. The time
before Lida had been set the story up to Abraham to learn by heart.


"And so Adam and Eve had two sons," said Laptev. "Very good. But
what were they called? Try to remember them!"


Lida, still with the same severe face, gazed dumbly at the table.
She moved her lips, but without speaking; and the elder girl, Sasha,
looked into her face, frowning.


"You know it very well, only you mustn't be nervous," said Laptev.
"Come, what were Adam's sons called?"


"Abel and Canel," Lida whispered.


"Cain and Abel," Laptev corrected her.


A big tear rolled down Lida's cheek and dropped on the book. Sasha
looked down and turned red, and she, too, was on the point of tears.
Laptev felt a lump in his throat, and was so sorry for them he could
not speak. He got up from the table and lighted a cigarette. At
that moment Kotchevoy came down the stairs with a paper in his hand.
The little girls stood up, and without looking at him, made curtsies.


"For God's sake, Kostya, give them their lessons," said Laptev,
turning to him. "I'm afraid I shall cry, too, and I have to go to
the warehouse before dinner."


"All right."


Alexey Fyodorovitch went away. Kostya, with a very serious face,
sat down to the table and drew the Scripture history towards him.


"Well," he said; "where have you got to?"


"She knows about the Flood," said Sasha.


"The Flood? All right. Let's peg in at the Flood. Fire away about
the Flood." Kostya skimmed through a brief description of the Flood
in the book, and said: "I must remark that there really never was
a flood such as is described here. And there was no such person as
Noah. Some thousands of years before the birth of Christ, there was
an extraordinary inundation of the earth, and that's not only
mentioned in the Jewish Bible, but in the books of other ancient
peoples: the Greeks, the Chaldeans, the Hindoos. But whatever the
inundation may have been, it couldn't have covered the whole earth.
It may have flooded the plains, but the mountains must have remained.
You can read this book, of course, but don't put too much faith in
it."


Tears trickled down Lida's face again. She turned away and suddenly
burst into such loud sobs, that Kostya started and jumped up from
his seat in great confusion.


"I want to go home," she said, "to papa and to nurse."


Sasha cried too. Kostya went upstairs to his own room, and spoke
on the telephone to Yulia Sergeyevna.


"My dear soul," he said, "the little girls are crying again; there's
no doing anything with them."


Yulia Sergeyevna ran across from the big house in her indoor dress,
with only a knitted shawl over her shoulders, and chilled through
by the frost, began comforting the children.


"Do believe me, do believe me," she said in an imploring voice,
hugging first one and then the other. "Your papa's coming to-day;
he has sent a telegram. You're grieving for mother, and I grieve
too. My heart's torn, but what can we do? We must bow to God's
will!"


When they left off crying, she wrapped them up and took them out
for a drive. They stopped near the Iverskoy chapel, put up candles
at the shrine, and, kneeling down, prayed. On the way back they
went in Filippov's, and had cakes sprinkled with poppy-seeds.


The Laptevs had dinner between two and three. Pyotr handed the
dishes. This Pyotr waited on the family, and by day ran to the post,
to the warehouse, to the law courts for Kostya; he spent his evenings
making cigarettes, ran to open the door at night, and before five
o'clock in the morning was up lighting the stoves, and no one knew
where he slept. He was very fond of opening seltzer-water bottles
and did it easily, without a bang and without spilling a drop.


"With God's blessing," said Kostya, drinking off a glass of vodka
before the soup.


At first Yulia Sergeyevna did not like Kostya; his bass voice, his
phrases such as "Landed him one on the beak," "filth," "produce the
samovar," etc., his habit of clinking glasses and making sentimental
speeches, seemed to her trivial. But as she got to know him better,
she began to feel very much at home with him. He was open with her;
he liked talking to her in a low voice in the evening, and even
gave her novels of his own composition to read, though these had
been kept a secret even from such friends as Laptev and Yartsev.
She read these novels and praised them, so that she might not
disappoint him, and he was delighted because he hoped sooner or
later to become a distinguished author.


In his novels he described nothing but country-house life, though
he had only seen the country on rare occasions when visiting friends
at a summer villa, and had only been in a real country-house once
in his life, when he had been to Volokolamsk on law business. He
avoided any love interest as though he were ashamed of it; he put
in frequent descriptions of nature, and in them was fond of using
such expressions as, "the capricious lines of the mountains, the
miraculous forms of the clouds, the harmony of mysterious rhythms
. . . ." His novels had never been published, and this he attributed
to the censorship.


He liked the duties of a lawyer, but yet he considered that his
most important pursuit was not the law but these novels. He believed
that he had a subtle, Ã¦sthetic temperament, and he always had
leanings towards art. He neither sang nor played on any musical
instrument, and was absolutely without an ear for music, but he
attended all the symphony and philharmonic concerts, got up concerts
for charitable objects, and made the acquaintance of singers. . . .


They used to talk at dinner.


"It's a strange thing," said Laptev, "my Fyodor took my breath away
again! He said we must find out the date of the centenary of our
firm, so as to try and get raised to noble rank; and he said it
quite seriously. What can be the matter with him? I confess I begin
to feel worried about him."


They talked of Fyodor, and of its being the fashion nowadays to
adopt some pose or other. Fyodor, for instance, tried to appear
like a plain merchant, though he had ceased to be one; and when the
teacher came from the school, of which old Laptev was the patron,
to ask Fyodor for his salary, the latter changed his voice and
deportment, and behaved with the teacher as though he were some one
in authority.


There was nothing to be done; after dinner they went into the study.
They talked about the decadents, about "The Maid of Orleans," and
Kostya delivered a regular monologue; he fancied that he was very
successful in imitating Ermolova. Then they sat down and played
whist. The little girls had not gone back to the lodge but were
sitting together in one arm-chair, with pale and mournful faces,
and were listening to every noise in the street, wondering whether
it was their father coming. In the evening when it was dark and the
candles were lighted, they felt deeply dejected. The talk over the
whist, the footsteps of Pyotr, the crackling in the fireplace,
jarred on their nerves, and they did not like to look at the fire.
In the evenings they did not want to cry, but they felt strange,
and there was a load on their hearts. They could not understand how
people could talk and laugh when their mother was dead.


"What did you see through the field-glasses today?" Yulia Sergeyevna
asked Kostya.


"Nothing to-day, but yesterday I saw the old Frenchman having his
bath."


At seven o'clock Yulia and Kostya went to the Little Theatre. Laptev
was left with the little girls.


"It's time your father was here," he said, looking at his watch.
"The train must be late."


The children sat in their arm-chair dumb and huddling together like
animals when they are cold, while he walked about the room looking
impatiently at his watch. It was quiet in the house. But just before
nine o'clock some one rang at the bell. Pyotr went to open the door.


Hearing a familiar voice, the children shrieked, burst into sobs,
and ran into the hall. Panaurov was wearing a sumptuous coat of
antelope skin, and his head and moustaches were white with hoar
frost. "In a minute, in a minute," he muttered, while Sasha and
Lida, sobbing and laughing, kissed his cold hands, his hat, his
antelope coat. With the languor of a handsome man spoilt by too
much love, he fondled the children without haste, then went into
the study and said, rubbing his hands:


"I've not come to stay long, my friends. I'm going to Petersburg
to-morrow. They've promised to transfer me to another town."


He was staying at the Dresden Hotel.



X


A friend who was often at the Laptevs' was Ivan Gavrilitch Yartsev.
He was a strong, healthy man with black hair and a clever, pleasant
face. He was considered to be handsome, but of late he had begun
to grow stout, and that rather spoilt his face and figure; another
thing that spoilt him was that he wore his hair cut so close that
the skin showed through.


At the University his tall figure and physical strength had won him
the nickname of "the pounder" among the students. He had taken his
degree with the Laptev brothers in the faculty of philology--then
he went in for science and now had the degree of _magister_ in
chemistry. But he had never given a lecture or even been a demonstrator.
He taught physics and natural history in the modern school, and in
two girls' high schools. He was enthusiastic over his pupils,
especially the girls, and used to maintain that a remarkable
generation was growing up. At home he spent his time studying
sociology and Russian history, as well as chemistry, and he sometimes
published brief notes in the newspapers and magazines, signing them
"Y." When he talked of some botanical or zoological subject, he
spoke like an historian; when he was discussing some historical
question, he approached it as a man of science.


Kish, nicknamed "the eternal student," was also like one of the
family at the Laptevs'. He had been for three years studying medicine.
Then he took up mathematics, and spent two years over each year's
course. His father, a provincial druggist, used to send him forty
roubles a month, to which his mother, without his father's knowledge,
added another ten. And this sum was not only sufficient for his
board and lodging, but even for such luxuries as an overcoat lined
with Polish beaver, gloves, scent, and photographs (he often had
photographs taken of himself and used to distribute them among his
friends). He was neat and demure, slightly bald, with golden
side-whiskers, and he had the air of a man nearly always ready to
oblige. He was always busy looking after other people's affairs.
At one time he would be rushing about with a subscription list; at
another time he would be freezing in the early morning at a ticket
office to buy tickets for ladies of his acquaintance, or at somebody's
request would be ordering a wreath or a bouquet. People simply said
of him: "Kish will go, Kish will do it, Kish will buy it." He was
usually unsuccessful in carrying out his commissions. Reproaches
were showered upon him, people frequently forgot to pay him for the
things he bought, but he simply sighed in hard cases and never
protested. He was never particularly delighted nor disappointed;
his stories were always long and boring; and his jokes invariably
provoked laughter just because they were not funny. Thus, one day,
for instance, intending to make a joke, he said to Pyotr: "Pyotr,
you're not a sturgeon;" and this aroused a general laugh, and he,
too, laughed for a long time, much pleased at having made such a
successful jest. Whenever one of the professors was buried, he
walked in front with the mutes.


Yartsev and Kish usually came in the evening to tea. If the Laptevs
were not going to the theatre or a concert, the evening tea lingered
on till supper. One evening in February the following conversation
took place:


"A work of art is only significant and valuable when there are some
serious social problems contained in its central idea," said Kostya,
looking wrathfully at Yartsev. "If there is in the work a protest
against serfdom, or the author takes up arms against the vulgarity
of aristocratic society, the work is significant and valuable. The
novels that are taken up with 'Ach!' and 'Och!' and 'she loved him,
while he ceased to love her,' I tell you, are worthless, and damn
them all, I say!"


"I agree with you, Konstantin Ivanovitch," said Yulia Sergeyevna.
"One describes a love scene; another, a betrayal; and the third,
meeting again after separation. Are there no other subjects? Why,
there are many people sick, unhappy, harassed by poverty, to whom
reading all that must be distasteful."


It was disagreeable to Laptev to hear his wife, not yet twenty-two,
speaking so seriously and coldly about love. He understood why this
was so.


"If poetry does not solve questions that seem so important," said
Yartsev, "you should turn to works on technical subjects, criminal
law, or finance, read scientific pamphlets. What need is there to
discuss in 'Romeo and Juliet,' liberty of speech, or the disinfecting
of prisons, instead of love, when you can find all that in special
articles and textbooks?"


"That's pushing it to the extreme," Kostya interrupted. "We are not
talking of giants like Shakespeare or Goethe; we are talking of the
hundreds of talented mediocre writers, who would be infinitely more
valuable if they would let love alone, and would employ themselves
in spreading knowledge and humane ideas among the masses."


Kish, lisping and speaking a little through his nose, began telling
the story of a novel he had lately been reading. He spoke
circumstantially and without haste. Three minutes passed, then five,
then ten, and no one could make out what he was talking about, and
his face grew more and more indifferent, and his eyes more and more
blank.


"Kish, do be quick over it," Yulia Sergeyevna could not resist
saying; "it's really agonizing!"


"Shut up, Kish!" Kostya shouted to him.


They all laughed, and Kish with them.


Fyodor came in. Flushing red in patches, he greeted them all in a
nervous flurry, and led his brother away into the study. Of late
he had taken to avoiding the company of more than one person at
once.


"Let the young people laugh, while we speak from the heart in here,"
he said, settling himself in a deep arm-chair at a distance from
the lamp. "It's a long time, my dear brother, since we've seen each
other. How long is it since you were at the warehouse? I think it
must be a week."


"Yes, there's nothing for me to do there. And I must confess that
the old man wearies me."


"Of course, they could get on at the warehouse without you and me,
but one must have some occupation. 'In the sweat of thy brow thou
shalt eat bread,' as it is written. God loves work."


Pyotr brought in a glass of tea on a tray. Fyodor drank it without
sugar, and asked for more. He drank a great deal of tea, and could
get through as many as ten glasses in the evening.


"I tell you what, brother," he said, getting up and going to his
brother. "Laying aside philosophic subtleties, you must get elected
on to the town council, and little by little we will get you on to
the local Board, and then to be an alderman. And as time goes on
--you are a clever man and well-educated--you will be noticed
in Petersburg and asked to go there--active men on the provincial
assemblies and town councils are all the fashion there now--and
before you are fifty you'll be a privy councillor, and have a ribbon
across your shoulders."


Laptev made no answer; he knew that all this--being a privy
councillor and having a ribbon over his shoulder--was what Fyodor
desired for himself, and he did not know what to say.


The brothers sat still and said nothing. Fyodor opened his watch
and for a long, long time gazed into it with strained attention,
as though he wanted to detect the motion of the hand, and the
expression of his face struck Laptev as strange.


They were summoned to supper. Laptev went into the dining-room,
while Fyodor remained in the study. The argument was over and Yartsev
was speaking in the tones of a professor giving a lecture:


"Owing to differences of climate, of energy, of tastes, of age,
equality among men is physically impossible. But civilised man can
make this inequality innocuous, as he has already done with bogs
and bears. A learned man succeeded in making a cat, a mouse, a
falcon, a sparrow, all eat out of one plate; and education, one
must hope, will do the same thing with men. Life continually
progresses, civilisation makes enormous advances before our eyes,
and obviously a time will come when we shall think, for instance,
the present condition of the factory population as absurd as we now
do the state of serfdom, in which girls were exchanged for dogs."


"That won't be for a long while, a very long while," said Kostya,
with a laugh, "not till Rothschild thinks his cellars full of gold
absurd, and till then the workers may bend their backs and die of
hunger. No; that's not it. We mustn't wait for it; we must struggle
for it. Do you suppose because the cat eats out of the same saucer
as the mouse--do you suppose that she is influenced by a sense
of conscious intelligence? Not a bit of it! She's made to do it by
force."


"Fyodor and I are rich; our father's a capitalist, a millionaire.
You will have to struggle with us," said Laptev, rubbing his forehead
with his hand. "Struggle with me is an idea I cannot grasp. I am
rich, but what has money given me so far? What has this power given
me? In what way am I happier than you? My childhood was slavery,
and money did not save me from the birch. When Nina was ill and
died, my money did not help her. If people don't care for me, I
can't make them like me if I spend a hundred million."


"But you can do a great deal of good," said Kish.


"Good, indeed! You spoke to me yesterday of a mathematical man who
is looking for a job. Believe me, I can do as little for him as you
can. I can give money, but that's not what he wants--I asked a
well-known musician to help a poor violinist, and this is what he
answered: 'You apply to me just because you are not a musician
yourself.' In the same way I say to you that you apply for help to
me so confidently because you've never been in the position of a
rich man."


"Why you bring in the comparison with a well-known musician I don't
understand!" said Yulia Sergeyevna, and she flushed crimson. "What
has the well-known musician to do with it!"


Her face was quivering with hatred, and she dropped her eyes to
conceal the feeling. And not only her husband, but all the men
sitting at the table, knew what the look in her face meant.


"What has the well-known musician got to do with it?" she said
slowly. "Why, nothing's easier than helping some one poor."


Silence followed. Pyotr handed the woodcock, but they all refused
it, and ate nothing but salad. Laptev did not remember what he had
said, but it was clear to him that it was not his words that were
hateful, but the fact of his meddling in the conversation at all.


After supper he went into his study; intently, with a beating heart,
expecting further humiliation, he listened to what was going on in
the hall. An argument had sprung up there again. Then Yartsev sat
down to the piano and played a sentimental song. He was a man of
varied accomplishments; he could play and sing, and even perform
conjuring tricks.


"You may please yourselves, my friends, but I'm not going to stay
at home," said Yulia. "We must go somewhere."


They decided to drive out of town, and sent Kish to the merchant's
club to order a three-horse sledge. They did not ask Laptev to go
with them because he did not usually join these expeditions, and
because his brother was sitting with him; but he took it to mean
that his society bored them, and that he was not wanted in their
light-hearted youthful company. And his vexation, his bitter feeling,
was so intense that he almost shed tears. He was positively glad
that he was treated so ungraciously, that he was scorned, that he
was a stupid, dull husband, a money-bag; and it seemed to him, that
he would have been even more glad if his wife were to deceive him
that night with his best friend, and were afterwards to acknowledge
it, looking at him with hatred. . . . He was jealous on her account
of their student friends, of actors, of singers, of Yartsev, even
of casual acquaintances; and now he had a passionate longing for
her really to be unfaithful to him. He longed to find her in another
man's arms, and to be rid of this nightmare forever. Fyodor was
drinking tea, gulping it noisily. But he, too, got up to go.


"Our old father must have got cataract," he said, as he put on his
fur coat. "His sight has become very poor."


Laptev put on his coat, too, and went out. After seeing his brother
part of the way home, he took a sledge and drove to Yar's.


"And this is family happiness!" he said, jeering at himself. "This
is love!"


His teeth were chattering, and he did not know if it were jealousy
or something else. He walked about near the tables; listened to a
comic singer in the hall. He had not a single phrase ready if he
should meet his own party; and he felt sure beforehand that if he
met his wife, he would only smile pitifully and not cleverly, and
that every one would understand what feeling had induced him to
come here. He was bewildered by the electric light, the loud music,
the smell of powder, and the fact that the ladies he met looked at
him. He stood at the doors trying to see and to hear what was going
on in the private rooms, and it seemed to him that he was somehow
playing a mean, contemptible part on a level with the comic singers
and those ladies. Then he went to Strelna, but he found none of his
circle there, either; and only when on the way home he was again
driving up to Yar's, a three-horse sledge noisily overtook him. The
driver was drunk and shouting, and he could hear Yartsev laughing:
"Ha, ha, ha!"


Laptev returned home between three and four. Yulia Sergeyevna was
in bed. Noticing that she was not asleep, he went up to her and
said sharply:


"I understand your repulsion, your hatred, but you might spare me
before other people; you might conceal your feelings."


She got up and sat on the bed with her legs dangling. Her eyes
looked big and black in the lamplight.


"I beg your pardon," she said.


He could not utter a single word from excitement and the trembling
of his whole body; he stood facing her and was dumb. She trembled,
too, and sat with the air of a criminal waiting for explanations.


"How I suffer!" he said at last, and he clutched his head. "I'm in
hell, and I'm out of my mind."


"And do you suppose it's easy for me?" she asked, with a quiver in
her voice. "God alone knows what I go through."


"You've been my wife for six months, but you haven't a spark of
love for me in your heart. There's no hope, not one ray of light!
Why did you marry me?" Laptev went on with despair. "Why? What demon
thrust you into my arms? What did you hope for? What did you want?"


She looked at him with terror, as though she were afraid he would
kill her.


"Did I attract you? Did you like me?" he went on, gasping for breath.
"No. Then what? What? Tell me what?" he cried. "Oh, the cursed
money! The cursed money!"


"I swear to God, no!" she cried, and she crossed herself. She seemed
to shrink under the insult, and for the first time he heard her
crying. "I swear to God, no!" she repeated. "I didn't think about
your money; I didn't want it. I simply thought I should do wrong
if I refused you. I was afraid of spoiling your life and mine. And
now I am suffering for my mistake. I'm suffering unbearably!"


She sobbed bitterly, and he saw that she was hurt; and not knowing
what to say, dropped down on the carpet before her.


"That's enough; that's enough," he muttered. "I insulted you because
I love you madly." He suddenly kissed her foot and passionately
hugged it. "If only a spark of love," he muttered. "Come, lie to
me; tell me a lie! Don't say it's a mistake! . . ."


But she went on crying, and he felt that she was only enduring his
caresses as an inevitable consequence of her mistake. And the foot
he had kissed she drew under her like a bird. He felt sorry for
her.


She got into bed and covered her head over; he undressed and got
into bed, too. In the morning they both felt confused and did not
know what to talk about, and he even fancied she walked unsteadily
on the foot he had kissed.


Before dinner Panaurov came to say good-bye. Yulia had an irresistible
desire to go to her own home; it would be nice, she thought, to go
away and have a rest from married life, from the embarrassment and
the continual consciousness that she had done wrong. It was decided
at dinner that she should set off with Panaurov, and stay with her
father for two or three weeks until she was tired of it.



XI


She travelled with Panaurov in a reserved compartment; he had on
his head an astrachan cap of peculiar shape.


"Yes, Petersburg did not satisfy me," he said, drawling, with a
sigh. "They promise much, but nothing definite. Yes, my dear girl.
I have been a Justice of the Peace, a member of the local Board,
chairman of the Board of Magistrates, and finally councillor of the
provincial administration. I think I have served my country and
have earned the right to receive attention; but--would you believe
it?--I can never succeed in wringing from the authorities a post
in another town. . . ."


Panaurov closed his eyes and shook his head.


"They don't recognise me," he went on, as though dropping asleep.
"Of course I'm not an administrator of genius, but, on the other
hand, I'm a decent, honest man, and nowadays even that's something
rare. I regret to say I have not been always quite straightforward
with women, but in my relations with the Russian government I've
always been a gentleman. But enough of that," he said, opening his
eyes; "let us talk of you. What put it into your head to visit your
papa so suddenly?"


"Well. . . . I had a little misunderstanding with my husband," said
Yulia, looking at his cap.


"Yes. What a queer fellow he is! All the Laptevs are queer. Your
husband's all right--he's nothing out of the way, but his brother
Fyodor is a perfect fool."


Panaurov sighed and asked seriously:


"And have you a lover yet?"


Yulia looked at him in amazement and laughed.


"Goodness knows what you're talking about."


It was past ten o'clock when they got out at a big station and had
supper. When the train went on again Panaurov took off his greatcoat
and his cap, and sat down beside Yulia.


"You are very charming, I must tell you," he began. "Excuse me for
the eating-house comparison, but you remind me of fresh salted
cucumber; it still smells of the hotbed, so to speak, and yet has
a smack of the salt and a scent of fennel about it. As time goes
on you will make a magnificent woman, a wonderful, exquisite woman.
If this trip of ours had happened five years ago," he sighed, "I
should have felt it my duty to join the ranks of your adorers, but
now, alas, I'm a veteran on the retired list."


He smiled mournfully, but at the same time graciously, and put his
arm round her waist.


"You must be mad!" she said; she flushed crimson and was so frightened
that her hands and feet turned cold.


"Leave off, Grigory Nikolaevitch!"


"What are you afraid of, dear?" he asked softly. "What is there
dreadful about it? It's simply that you're not used to it."


If a woman protested he always interpreted it as a sign that he had
made an impression on her and attracted her. Holding Yulia round
the waist, he kissed her firmly on the cheek, then on the lips, in
the full conviction that he was giving her intense gratification.
Yulia recovered from her alarm and confusion, and began laughing.
He kissed her once more and said, as he put on his ridiculous cap:


"That is all that the old veteran can give you. A Turkish Pasha, a
kind-hearted old fellow, was presented by some one--or inherited,
I fancy it was--a whole harem. When his beautiful young wives
drew up in a row before him, he walked round them, kissed each one
of them, and said: 'That is all that I am equal to giving you.' And
that's just what I say, too."


All this struck her as stupid and extraordinary, and amused her.
She felt mischievous. Standing up on the seat and humming, she got
a box of sweets from the shelf, and throwing him a piece of chocolate,
shouted:


"Catch!"


He caught it. With a loud laugh she threw him another sweet, then
a third, and he kept catching them and putting them into his mouth,
looking at her with imploring eyes; and it seemed to her that in
his face, his features, his expression, there was a great deal that
was feminine and childlike. And when, out of breath, she sat down
on the seat and looked at him, laughing, he tapped her cheek with
two fingers, and said as though he were vexed:


"Naughty girl!"


"Take it," she said, giving him the box. "I don't care for sweet
things."


He ate up the sweets--every one of them, and locked the empty box
in his trunk; he liked boxes with pictures on them.


"That's mischief enough, though," he said. "It's time for the veteran
to go bye-bye."


He took out of his hold-all a Bokhara dressing-gown and a pillow,
lay down, and covered himself with the dressing-gown.


"Good-night, darling!" he said softly, and sighed as though his
whole body ached.


And soon a snore was heard. Without the slightest feeling of
constraint, she, too, lay down and went to sleep.


When next morning she drove through her native town from the station
homewards, the streets seemed to her empty and deserted. The snow
looked grey, and the houses small, as though some one had squashed
them. She was met by a funeral procession: the dead body was carried
in an open coffin with banners.


"Meeting a funeral, they say, is lucky," she thought.


There were white bills pasted in the windows of the house where
Nina Fyodorovna used to live.


With a sinking at her heart she drove into her own courtyard and
rang at the door. It was opened by a servant she did not know--a
plump, sleepy-looking girl wearing a warm wadded jacket. As she
went upstairs Yulia remembered how Laptev had declared his love
there, but now the staircase was unscrubbed, covered with foot-marks.
Upstairs in the cold passage patients were waiting in their out-door
coats. And for some reason her heart beat violently, and she was
so excited she could scarcely walk.


The doctor, who had grown even stouter, was sitting with a brick-red
face and dishevelled hair, drinking tea. Seeing his daughter, he
was greatly delighted, and even lacrymose. She thought that she was
the only joy in this old man's life, and much moved, she embraced
him warmly, and told him she would stay a long time--till Easter.
After taking off her things in her own room, she went back to the
dining-room to have tea with him. He was pacing up and down with
his hands in his pockets, humming, "Ru-ru-ru"; this meant that he
was dissatisfied with something.


"You have a gay time of it in Moscow," he said. "I am very glad for
your sake. . . . I'm an old man and I need nothing. I shall soon
give up the ghost and set you all free. And the wonder is that my
hide is so tough, that I'm alive still! It's amazing!"


He said that he was a tough old ass that every one rode on. They
had thrust on him the care of Nina Fyodorovna, the worry of her
children, and of her burial; and that coxcomb Panaurov would not
trouble himself about it, and had even borrowed a hundred roubles
from him and had never paid it back.


"Take me to Moscow and put me in a madhouse," said the doctor. "I'm
mad; I'm a simple child, as I still put faith in truth and justice."


Then he found fault with her husband for his short-sightedness in
not buying houses that were being sold so cheaply. And now it seemed
to Yulia that she was not the one joy in this old man's life. While
he was seeing his patients, and afterwards going his rounds, she
walked through all the rooms, not knowing what to do or what to
think about. She had already grown strange to her own town and her
own home. She felt no inclination to go into the streets or see her
friends; and at the thought of her old friends and her life as a
girl, she felt no sadness nor regret for the past.


In the evening she dressed a little more smartly and went to the
evening service. But there were only poor people in the church, and
her splendid fur coat and hat made no impression. And it seemed to
her that there was some change in the church as well as in herself.
In old days she had loved it when they read the prayers for the day
at evening service, and the choir sang anthems such as "I will open
my lips." She liked moving slowly in the crowd to the priest who
stood in the middle of the church, and then to feel the holy oil
on her forehead; now she only waited for the service to be over.
And now, going out of the church, she was only afraid that beggars
would ask for alms; it was such a bore to have to stop and feel for
her pockets; besides, she had no coppers in her pocket now--nothing
but roubles.


She went to bed early, and was a long time in going to sleep. She
kept dreaming of portraits of some sort, and of the funeral procession
she had met that morning. The open coffin with the dead body was
carried into the yard, and brought to a standstill at the door;
then the coffin was swung backwards and forwards on a sheet, and
dashed violently against the door. Yulia woke and jumped up in
alarm. There really was a bang at the door, and the wire of the
bell rustled against the wall, though no ring was to be heard.


The doctor coughed. Then she heard the servant go downstairs, and
then come back.


"Madam!" she said, and knocked at the door. "Madam!"


"What is it?" said Yulia.


"A telegram for you!"


Yulia went out to her with a candle. Behind the servant stood the
doctor, in his night-clothes and greatcoat, and he, too, had a
candle in his hand. "Our bell is broken," he said, yawning sleepily.
"It ought to have been mended long ago."


Yulia broke open the telegram and read:


"We drink to your health.--YARTSEV, KOTCHEVOY."


"Ah, what idiots!" she said, and burst out laughing; and her heart
felt light and gay.


Going back into her room, she quietly washed and dressed, then she
spent a long time in packing her things, until it was daylight, and
at midday she set off for Moscow.



XII


In Holy Week the Laptevs went to an exhibition of pictures in the
school of painting. The whole family went together in the Moscow
fashion, the little girls, the governess, Kostya, and all.


Laptev knew the names of all the well-known painters, and never
missed an exhibition. He used sometimes to paint little landscape
paintings when he was in the country in the summer, and he fancied
he had a good deal of taste, and that if he had studied he might
have made a good painter. When he was abroad he sometimes used to
go to curio shops, examining the antiques with the air of a connoisseur
and giving his opinion on them. When he bought any article he gave
just what the shopkeeper liked to ask for it and his purchase
remained afterwards in a box in the coach-house till it disappeared
altogether. Or going into a print shop, he would slowly and attentively
examine the engravings and the bronzes, making various remarks on
them, and would buy a common frame or a box of wretched prints. At
home he had pictures always of large dimensions but of inferior
quality; the best among them were badly hung. It had happened to
him more than once to pay large sums for things which had afterwards
turned out to be forgeries of the grossest kind. And it was remarkable
that, though as a rule timid in the affairs of life, he was exceedingly
bold and self-confident at a picture exhibition. Why?


Yulia Sergeyevna looked at the pictures as her husband did, through
her open fist or an opera-glass, and was surprised that the people
in the pictures were like live people, and the trees like real
trees. But she did not understand art, and it seemed to her that
many pictures in the exhibition were alike, and she imagined that
the whole object in painting was that the figures and objects should
stand out as though they were real, when you looked at the picture
through your open fist.


"That forest is Shiskin's," her husband explained to her. "He always
paints the same thing. . . . But notice snow's never such a lilac
colour as that. . . . And that boy's left arm is shorter than his
right."


When they were all tired and Laptev had gone to look for Kostya,
that they might go home, Yulia stopped indifferently before a small
landscape. In the foreground was a stream, over it a little wooden
bridge; on the further side a path that disappeared in the dark
grass; a field on the right; a copse; near it a camp fire--no
doubt of watchers by night; and in the distance there was a glow
of the evening sunset.


Yulia imagined walking herself along the little bridge, and then
along the little path further and further, while all round was
stillness, the drowsy landrails calling and the fire flickering in
the distance. And for some reason she suddenly began to feel that
she had seen those very clouds that stretched across the red part
of the sky, and that copse, and that field before, many times before.
She felt lonely, and longed to walk on and on along the path; and
there, in the glow of sunset was the calm reflection of something
unearthly, eternal.


"How finely that's painted!" she said, surprised that the picture
had suddenly become intelligible to her.


"Look, Alyosha! Do you see how peaceful it is?"


She began trying to explain why she liked the landscape so much,
but neither Kostya nor her husband understood her. She kept looking
at the picture with a mournful smile, and the fact that the others
saw nothing special in it troubled her. Then she began walking
through the rooms and looking at the pictures again. She tried to
understand them and no longer thought that a great many of them
were alike. When, on returning home, for the first time she looked
attentively at the big picture that hung over the piano in the
drawing-room, she felt a dislike for it, and said:


"What an idea to have pictures like that!"


And after that the gilt cornices, the Venetian looking-glasses with
flowers on them, the pictures of the same sort as the one that hung
over the piano, and also her husband's and Kostya's reflections
upon art, aroused in her a feeling of dreariness and vexation, even
of hatred.


Life went on its ordinary course from day to day with no promise
of anything special. The theatrical season was over, the warm days
had come. There was a long spell of glorious weather. One morning
the Laptevs attended the district court to hear Kostya, who had
been appointed by the court to defend some one. They were late in
starting, and reached the court after the examination of the witnesses
had begun. A soldier in the reserve was accused of theft and
housebreaking. There were a great number of witnesses, washerwomen;
they all testified that the accused was often in the house of their
employer--a woman who kept a laundry. At the Feast of the Exaltation
of the Cross he came late in the evening and began asking for money;
he wanted a pick-me-up, as he had been drinking, but no one gave
him anything. Then he went away, but an hour afterwards he came
back, and brought with him some beer and a soft gingerbread cake
for the little girl. They drank and sang songs almost till daybreak,
and when in the morning they looked about, the lock of the door
leading up into the attic was broken, and of the linen three men's
shirts, a petticoat, and two sheets were missing. Kostya asked each
witness sarcastically whether she had not drunk the beer the accused
had brought. Evidently he was insinuating that the washerwomen had
stolen the linen themselves. He delivered his speech without the
slightest nervousness, looking angrily at the jury.


He explained what robbery with housebreaking meant, and the difference
between that and simple theft. He spoke very circumstantially and
convincingly, displaying an unusual talent for speaking at length
and in a serious tone about what had been know to every one long
before. And it was difficult to make out exactly what he was aiming
at. From his long speech the foreman of the jury could only have
deduced "that it was housebreaking but not robbery, as the washerwomen
had sold the linen for drink themselves; or, if there had been
robbery, there had not been housebreaking." But obviously, he said
just what was wanted, as his speech moved the jury and the audience,
and was very much liked. When they gave a verdict of acquittal,
Yulia nodded to Kostya, and afterwards pressed his hand warmly.


In May the Laptevs moved to a country villa at Sokolniki. By that
time Yulia was expecting a baby.



XIII


More than a year had passed. Yulia and Yartsev were lying on the
grass at Sokolniki not far from the embankment of the Yaroslav
railway; a little distance away Kotchevoy was lying with hands under
his head, looking at the sky. All three had been for a walk, and
were waiting for the six o'clock train to pass to go home to tea.


"Mothers see something extraordinary in their children, that is
ordained by nature," said Yulia. "A mother will stand for hours
together by the baby's cot looking at its little ears and eyes and
nose, and fascinated by them. If any one else kisses her baby the
poor thing imagines that it gives him immense pleasure. And a mother
talks of nothing but her baby. I know that weakness in mothers, and
I keep watch over myself, but my Olga really is exceptional. How
she looks at me when I'm nursing her! How she laughs! She's only
eight months old, but, upon my word, I've never seen such intelligent
eyes in a child of three."


"Tell me, by the way," asked Yartsev: "which do you love most--
your husband or your baby?"


Yulia shrugged her shoulders.


"I don't know," she said. "I never was so very fond of my husband,
and Olga is in reality my first love. You know that I did not marry
Alexey for love. In old days I was foolish and miserable, and thought
that I had ruined my life and his, and now I see that love is not
necessary--that it is all nonsense."


"But if it is not love, what feeling is it that binds you to your
husband? Why do you go on living with him?"


"I don't know. . . . I suppose it must be habit. I respect him, I
miss him when he's away for long, but that's--not love. He is a
clever, honest man, and that's enough to make me happy. He is very
kind and good-hearted. . . ."


"Alyosha's intelligent, Alyosha's good," said Kostya, raising his
head lazily; "but, my dear girl, to find out that he is intelligent,
good, and interesting, you have to eat a hundredweight of salt with
him. . . . And what's the use of his goodness and intelligence? He
can fork out money as much as you want, but when character is needed
to resist insolence or aggressiveness, he is faint-hearted and
overcome with nervousness. People like your amiable Alyosha are
splendid people, but they are no use at all for fighting. In fact,
they are no use for anything."


At last the train came in sight. Coils of perfectly pink smoke from
the funnels floated over the copse, and two windows in the last
compartment flashed so brilliantly in the sun, that it hurt their
eyes to look at it.


"Tea-time!" said Yulia Sergeyevna, getting up.


She had grown somewhat stouter of late, and her movements were
already a little matronly, a little indolent.


"It's bad to be without love though," said Yartsev, walking behind
her. "We talk and read of nothing else but love, but we do very
little loving ourselves, and that's really bad."


"All that's nonsense, Ivan Gavrilitch," said Yulia. "That's not
what gives happiness."


They had tea in the little garden, where mignonette, stocks, and
tobacco plants were in flower, and spikes of early gladiolus were
just opening. Yartsev and Kotchevoy could see from Yulia's face
that she was passing through a happy period of inward peace and
serenity, that she wanted nothing but what she had, and they, too,
had a feeling of peace and comfort in their hearts. Whatever was
said sounded apt and clever; the pines were lovely--the fragrance
of them was exquisite as it had never been before; and the cream
was very nice; and Sasha was a good, intelligent child.


After tea Yartsev sang songs, accompanying himself on the piano,
while Yulia and Kotchevoy sat listening in silence, though Yulia
got up from time to time, and went softly indoors, to take a look
at the baby and at Lida, who had been in bed for the last two days
feverish and eating nothing.


"My friend, my tender friend," sang Yartsev. "No, my friends, I'll
be hanged if I understand why you are all so against love!" he said,
flinging back his head. "If I weren't busy for fifteen hours of the
twenty-four, I should certainly fall in love."


Supper was served on the verandah; it was warm and still, but Yulia
wrapped herself in a shawl and complained of the damp. When it got
dark, she seemed not quite herself; she kept shivering and begging
her visitors to stay a little longer. She regaled them with wine,
and after supper ordered brandy to keep them from going. She didn't
want to be left alone with the children and the servants.


"We summer visitors are getting up a performance for the children,"
she said. "We have got everything--a stage and actors; we are
only at a loss for a play. Two dozen plays of different sorts have
been sent us, but there isn't one that is suitable. Now, you are
fond of the theatre, and are so good at history," she said, addressing
Yartsev. "Write an historical play for us."


"Well, I might."


The men drank up all the brandy, and prepared to go.


It was past ten, and for summer-villa people that was late.


"How dark it is! One can't see a bit," said Yulia, as she went with
them to the gate. "I don't know how you'll find your way. But, isn't
it cold?"


She wrapped herself up more closely and walked back to the porch.


"I suppose my Alexey's playing cards somewhere," she called to them.
"Good-night!"


After the lighted rooms nothing could be seen. Yartsev and Kostya
groped their way like blind men to the railway embankment and crossed
it.


"One can't see a thing," said Kostya in his bass voice, standing
still and gazing at the sky. "And the stars, the stars, they are
like new three-penny-bits. Gavrilitch!"


"Ah?" Yartsev responded somewhere in the darkness.


"I say, one can't see a thing. Where are you?"


Yartsev went up to him whistling, and took his arm.


"Hi, there, you summer visitors!" Kostya shouted at the top of his
voice. "We've caught a socialist."


When he was exhilarated he was always very rowdy, shouting, wrangling
with policemen and cabdrivers, singing, and laughing violently.


"Nature be damned," he shouted.


"Come, come," said Yartsev, trying to pacify him. "You mustn't.
Please don't."


Soon the friends grew accustomed to the darkness, and were able to
distinguish the outlines of the tall pines and telegraph posts.
From time to time the sound of whistles reached them from the station
and the telegraph wires hummed plaintively. From the copse itself
there came no sound, and there was a feeling of pride, strength,
and mystery in its silence, and on the right it seemed that the
tops of the pines were almost touching the sky. The friends found
their path and walked along it. There it was quite dark, and it was
only from the long strip of sky dotted with stars, and from the
firmly trodden earth under their feet, that they could tell they
were walking along a path. They walked along side by side in silence,
and it seemed to both of them that people were coming to meet them.
Their tipsy exhilaration passed off. The fancy came into Yartsev's
mind that perhaps that copse was haunted by the spirits of the
Muscovite Tsars, boyars, and patriarchs, and he was on the point
of telling Kostya about it, but he checked himself.


When they reached the town gate there was a faint light of dawn in
the sky. Still in silence, Yartsev and Kotchevoy walked along the
wooden pavement, by the cheap summer cottages, eating-houses,
timber-stacks. Under the arch of interlacing branches, the damp air
was fragrant of lime-trees, and then a broad, long street opened
before them, and on it not a soul, not a light. . . . When they
reached the Red Pond, it was daylight.


"Moscow--it's a town that will have to suffer a great deal more,"
said Yartsev, looking at the Alexyevsky Monastery.


"What put that into your head?"


"I don't know. I love Moscow."


Both Yartsev and Kostya had been born in Moscow, and adored the
town, and felt for some reason antagonistic to every other town.
Both were convinced that Moscow was a remarkable town, and Russia
a remarkable country. In the Crimea, in the Caucasus, and abroad,
they felt dull, uncomfortable, and ill at ease, and they thought
their grey Moscow weather very pleasant and healthy. And when the
rain lashed at the window-panes and it got dark early, and when the
walls of the churches and houses looked a drab, dismal colour, days
when one doesn't know what to put on when one is going out--such
days excited them agreeably.


At last near the station they took a cab.


"It really would be nice to write an historical play," said Yartsev,
"but not about the Lyapunovs or the Godunovs, but of the times of
Yaroslav or of Monomach. . . . I hate all historical plays except
the monologue of Pimen. When you have to do with some historical
authority or even read a textbook of Russian history, you feel that
every one in Russia is exceptionally talented, gifted, and interesting;
but when I see an historical play at the theatre, Russian life
begins to seem stupid, morbid, and not original."


Near Dmitrovka the friends separated, and Yartsev went on to his
lodging in Nikitsky Street. He sat half dozing, swaying from side
to side, and pondering on the play. He suddenly imagined a terrible
din, a clanging noise, and shouts in some unknown language, that
might have been Kalmuck, and a village wrapped in flames, and forests
near covered with hoarfrost and soft pink in the glow of the fire,
visible for miles around, and so clearly that every little fir-tree
could be distinguished, and savage men darting about the village
on horseback and on foot, and as red as the glow in the sky.


"The Polovtsy," thought Yartsev.


One of them, a terrible old man with a bloodstained face all scorched
from the fire, binds to his saddle a young girl with a white Russian
face, and the girl looks sorrowful, understanding. Yartsev flung
back his head and woke up.


"My friend, my tender friend . . ." he hummed.


As he paid the cabman and went up his stairs, he could not shake
off his dreaminess; he saw the flames catching the village, and the
forest beginning to crackle and smoke. A huge, wild bear frantic
with terror rushed through the village. . . . And the girl tied to
the saddle was still looking.


When at last he went into his room it was broad daylight. Two candles
were burning by some open music on the piano. On the sofa lay Polina
Razsudin wearing a black dress and a sash, with a newspaper in her
hand, fast asleep. She must have been playing late, waiting for
Yartsev to come home, and, tired of waiting, fell asleep.


"Hullo, she's worn out," he thought.


Carefully taking the newspaper out of her hands, he covered her
with a rug. He put out the candles and went into his bedroom. As
he got into bed, he still thought of his historical play, and the
tune of "My friend, my tender friend" was still ringing in his
head. . . .


Two days later Laptev looked in upon him for a moment to tell him
that Lida was ill with diphtheria, and that Yulia Sergeyevna and
her baby had caught it from her, and five days later came the news
that Lida and Yulia were recovering, but the baby was dead, and
that the Laptevs had left their villa at Sokolniki and had hastened
back to Moscow.



XIV


It had become distasteful to Laptev to be long at home. His wife
was constantly away in the lodge declaring that she had to look
after the little girls, but he knew that she did not go to the lodge
to give them lessons but to cry in Kostya's room. The ninth day
came, then the twentieth, and then the fortieth, and still he had
to go to the cemetery to listen to the requiem, and then to wear
himself out for a whole day and night thinking of nothing but that
unhappy baby, and trying to comfort his wife with all sorts of
commonplace expressions. He went rarely to the warehouse now, and
spent most of his time in charitable work, seizing upon every pretext
requiring his attention, and he was glad when he had for some trivial
reason to be out for the whole day. He had been intending of late
to go abroad, to study night-refuges, and that idea attracted him
now.


It was an autumn day. Yulia had just gone to the lodge to cry, while
Laptev lay on a sofa in the study thinking where he could go. Just
at that moment Pyotr announced Polina Razsudin. Laptev was delighted;
he leapt up and went to meet the unexpected visitor, who had been
his closest friend, though he had almost begun to forget her. She
had not changed in the least since that evening when he had seen
her for the last time, and was just the same as ever.


"Polina," he said, holding out both hands to her. "What ages! If
you only knew how glad I am to see you! Do come in!"


Polina greeted him, jerked him by the hand, and without taking off
her coat and hat, went into the study and sat down.


"I've come to you for one minute," she said. "I haven't time to
talk of any nonsense. Sit down and listen. Whether you are glad to
see me or not is absolutely nothing to me, for I don't care a straw
for the gracious attentions of you lords of creation. I've only
come to you because I've been to five other places already to-day,
and everywhere I was met with a refusal, and it's a matter that
can't be put off. Listen," she went on, looking into his face. "Five
students of my acquaintance, stupid, unintelligent people, but
certainly poor, have neglected to pay their fees, and are being
excluded from the university. Your wealth makes it your duty to go
straight to the university and pay for them."


"With pleasure, Polina."


"Here are their names," she said, giving him a list. "Go this minute;
you'll have plenty of time to enjoy your domestic happiness
afterwards."


At that moment a rustle was heard through the door that led into
the drawing-room; probably the dog was scratching itself. Polina
turned crimson and jumped up.


"Your Dulcinea's eavesdropping," she said. "That's horrid!"


Laptev was offended at this insult to Yulia.


"She's not here; she's in the lodge," he said. "And don't speak of
her like that. Our child is dead, and she is in great distress."


"You can console her," Polina scoffed, sitting down again; "she'll
have another dozen. You don't need much sense to bring children
into the world."


Laptev remembered that he had heard this, or something very like
it, many times in old days, and it brought back a whiff of the
romance of the past, of solitary freedom, of his bachelor life,
when he was young and thought he could do anything he chose, when
he had neither love for his wife nor memory of his baby.


"Let us go together," he said, stretching.


When they reached the university Polina waited at the gate, while
Laptev went into the office; he came back soon afterwards and handed
Polina five receipts.


"Where are you going now?" he asked.


"To Yartsev's."


"I'll come with you."


"But you'll prevent him from writing."


"No, I assure you I won't," he said, and looked at her imploringly.


She had on a black hat trimmed with crape, as though she were in
mourning, and a short, shabby coat, the pockets of which stuck out.
Her nose looked longer than it used to be, and her face looked
bloodless in spite of the cold. Laptev liked walking with her, doing
what she told him, and listening to her grumbling. He walked along
thinking about her, what inward strength there must be in this
woman, since, though she was so ugly, so angular, so restless,
though she did not know how to dress, and always had untidy hair,
and was always somehow out of harmony, she was yet so fascinating.


They went into Yartsev's flat by the back way through the kitchen,
where they were met by the cook, a clean little old woman with grey
curls; she was overcome with embarrassment, and with a honeyed smile
which made her little face look like a pie, said:


"Please walk in."


Yartsev was not at home. Polina sat down to the piano, and beginning
upon a tedious, difficult exercise, told Laptev not to hinder her.
And without distracting her attention by conversation, he sat on
one side and began turning over the pages of a "The Messenger of
Europe." After practising for two hours--it was the task she set
herself every day--she ate something in the kitchen and went out
to her lessons. Laptev read the continuation of a story, then sat
for a long time without reading and without being bored, glad to
think that he was too late for dinner at home.


"Ha, ha, ha!" came Yartsev's laugh, and he walked in with ruddy
cheeks, looking strong and healthy, wearing a new coat with bright
buttons. "Ha, ha, ha!"


The friends dined together. Then Laptev lay on the sofa while Yartsev
sat near and lighted a cigar. It got dark.


"I must be getting old," said Laptev. "Ever since my sister Nina
died, I've taken to constantly thinking of death."


They began talking of death, of the immortality of the soul, of how
nice it would be to rise again and fly off somewhere to Mars, to
be always idle and happy, and, above all, to think in a new special
way, not as on earth.


"One doesn't want to die," said Yartsev softly. "No sort of philosophy
can reconcile me to death, and I look on it simply as annihilation.
One wants to live."


"You love life, Gavrilitch?"


"Yes, I love it."


"Do you know, I can never understand myself about that. I'm always
in a gloomy mood or else indifferent. I'm timid, without self-confidence;
I have a cowardly conscience; I never can adapt myself to life, or
become its master. Some people talk nonsense or cheat, and even so
enjoy life, while I consciously do good, and feel nothing but
uneasiness or complete indifference. I explain all that, Gavrilitch,
by my being a slave, the grandson of a serf. Before we plebeians
fight our way into the true path, many of our sort will perish on
the way."


"That's all quite right, my dear fellow," said Yartsev, and he
sighed. "That only proves once again how rich and varied Russian
life is. Ah, how rich it is! Do you know, I feel more convinced
every day that we are on the eve of the greatest triumph, and I
should like to live to take part in it. Whether you like to believe
it or not, to my thinking a remarkable generation is growing up.
It gives me great enjoyment to teach the children, especially the
girls. They are wonderful children!"


Yartsev went to the piano and struck a chord.


"I'm a chemist, I think in chemical terms, and I shall die a chemist,"
he went on. "But I am greedy, and I am afraid of dying unsatisfied;
and chemistry is not enough for me, and I seize upon Russian history,
history of art, the science of teaching music. . . . Your wife asked
me in the summer to write an historical play, and now I'm longing
to write and write. I feel as though I could sit for three days and
three nights without moving, writing all the time. I am worn out
with ideas--my brain's crowded with them, and I feel as though
there were a pulse throbbing in my head. I don't in the least want
to become anything special, to create something great. I simply
want to live, to dream, to hope, to be in the midst of everything
. . . . Life is short, my dear fellow, and one must make the most of
everything."


After this friendly talk, which was not over till midnight, Laptev
took to coming to see Yartsev almost every day. He felt drawn to
him. As a rule he came towards evening, lay down on the sofa, and
waited patiently for Yartsev to come in, without feeling in the
least bored. When Yartsev came back from his work, he had dinner,
and sat down to work; but Laptev would ask him a question, a
conversation would spring up, and there was no more thought of work
and at midnight the friends parted very well pleased with one
another.


But this did not last long. Arriving one day at Yartsev's, Laptev
found no one there but Polina, who was sitting at the piano practising
her exercises. She looked at him with a cold, almost hostile
expression, and asked without shaking hands:


"Tell me, please: how much longer is this going on?"


"This? What?" asked Laptev, not understanding.


"You come here every day and hinder Yartsev from working. Yartsev
is not a tradesman; he is a scientific man, and every moment of his
life is precious. You ought to understand and to have some little
delicacy!"


"If you think that I hinder him," said Laptev, mildly, disconcerted,
"I will give up my visits."


"Quite right, too. You had better go, or he may be home in a minute
and find you here."


The tone in which this was said, and the indifference in Polina's
eyes, completely disconcerted him. She had absolutely no sort of
feeling for him now, except the desire that he should go as soon
as possible--and what a contrast it was to her old love for him!
He went out without shaking hands with her, and he fancied she would
call out to him, bring him back, but he heard the scales again, and
as he slowly went down the stairs he realised that he had become a
stranger to her now.


Three days later Yartsev came to spend the evening with him.


"I have news," he said, laughing. "Polina Nikolaevna has moved into
my rooms altogether." He was a little confused, and went on in a
low voice: "Well, we are not in love with each other, of course,
but I suppose that . . . that doesn't matter. I am glad I can give
her a refuge and peace and quiet, and make it possible for her not
to work if she's ill. She fancies that her coming to live with me
will make things more orderly, and that under her influence I shall
become a great scientist. That's what she fancies. And let her fancy
it. In the South they have a saying: 'Fancy makes the fool a rich
man.' Ha, ha, ha!"


Laptev said nothing. Yartsev walked up and down the study, looking
at the pictures he had seen so many times before, and said with a
sigh:


"Yes, my dear fellow, I am three years older than you are, and it's
too late for me to think of real love, and in reality a woman like
Polina Nikolaevna is a godsend to me, and, of course, I shall get
on capitally with her till we're both old people; but, goodness
knows why, one still regrets something, one still longs for something,
and I still feel as though I am lying in the Vale of Daghestan and
dreaming of a ball. In short, man's never satisfied with what he
has."


He went into the drawing-room and began singing as though nothing
had happened, and Laptev sat in his study with his eyes shut, and
tried to understand why Polina had gone to live with Yartsev. And
then he felt sad that there were no lasting, permanent attachments.
And he felt vexed that Polina Nikolaevna had gone to live with
Yartsev, and vexed with himself that his feeling for his wife was
not what it had been.



XV


Laptev sat reading and swaying to and fro in a rocking-chair; Yulia
was in the study, and she, too, was reading. It seemed there was
nothing to talk about; they had both been silent all day. From time
to time he looked at her from over his book and thought: "Whether
one marries from passionate love, or without love at all, doesn't
it come to the same thing?" And the time when he used to be jealous,
troubled, distressed, seemed to him far away. He had succeeded in
going abroad, and now he was resting after the journey and looking
forward to another visit in the spring to England, which he had
very much liked.


And Yulia Sergeyevna had grown used to her sorrow, and had left off
going to the lodge to cry. That winter she had given up driving out
shopping, had given up the theatres and concerts, and had stayed
at home. She never cared for big rooms, and always sat in her
husband's study or in her own room, where she had shrines of ikons
that had come to her on her marriage, and where there hung on the
wall the landscape that had pleased her so much at the exhibition.
She spent hardly any money on herself, and was almost as frugal now
as she had been in her father's house.


The winter passed cheerlessly. Card-playing was the rule everywhere
in Moscow, and if any other recreation was attempted, such as
singing, reading, drawing, the result was even more tedious. And
since there were few talented people in Moscow, and the same singers
and reciters performed at every entertainment, even the enjoyment
of art gradually palled and became for many people a tiresome and
monotonous social duty.


Moreover, the Laptevs never had a day without something vexatious
happening. Old Laptev's eyesight was failing; he no longer went to
the warehouse, and the oculist told them that he would soon be
blind. Fyodor had for some reason given up going to the warehouse
and spent his time sitting at home writing something. Panaurov had
got a post in another town, and had been promoted an actual civil
councillor, and was now staying at the Dresden. He came to the
Laptevs' almost every day to ask for money. Kish had finished his
studies at last, and while waiting for Laptev to find him a job,
used to spend whole days at a time with them, telling them long,
tedious stories. All this was irritating and exhausting, and made
daily life unpleasant.


Pyotr came into the study, and announced an unknown lady. On the
card he brought in was the name "Josephina Iosefovna Milan."


Yulia Sergeyevna got up languidly and went out limping slightly,
as her foot had gone to sleep. In the doorway appeared a pale, thin
lady with dark eyebrows, dressed altogether in black. She clasped
her hands on her bosom and said supplicatingly:


"M. Laptev, save my children!"


The jingle of her bracelets sounded familiar to him, and he knew
the face with patches of powder on it; he recognised her as the
lady with whom he had once so inappropriately dined before his
marriage. It was Panaurov's second wife.


"Save my children," she repeated, and her face suddenly quivered
and looked old and pitiful. "You alone can save us, and I have spent
my last penny coming to Moscow to see you! My children are starving!"


She made a motion as though she were going to fall on her knees.
Laptev was alarmed, and clutched her by the arm.


"Sit down, sit down . . ." he muttered, making her sit down. "I beg
you to be seated."


"We have no money to buy bread," she said. "Grigory Nikolaevitch
is going away to a new post, but he will not take the children and
me with him, and the money which you so generously send us he spends
only on himself. What are we to do? What? My poor, unhappy children!"


"Calm yourself, I beg. I will give orders that that money shall be
made payable to you."


She began sobbing, and then grew calmer, and he noticed that the
tears had made little pathways through the powder on her cheeks,
and that she was growing a moustache.


"You are infinitely generous, M. Laptev. But be our guardian angel,
our good fairy, persuade Grigory Nikolaevitch not to abandon me,
but to take me with him. You know I love him--I love him insanely;
he's the comfort of my life."


Laptev gave her a hundred roubles, and promised to talk to Panaurov,
and saw her out to the hall in trepidation the whole time, for fear
she should break into sobs or fall on her knees.


After her, Kish made his appearance. Then Kostya came in with his
photographic apparatus. Of late he had been attracted by photography
and took photographs of every one in the house several times a day.
This new pursuit caused him many disappointments, and he had actually
grown thinner.


Before evening tea Fyodor arrived. Sitting in a corner in the study,
he opened a book and stared for a long time at a page, obviously
not reading. Then he spent a long time drinking tea; his face turned
red. In his presence Laptev felt a load on his heart; even his
silence was irksome to him.


"Russia may be congratulated on the appearance of a new author,"
said Fyodor. "Joking apart, though, brother, I have turned out a
little article--the firstfruits of my pen, so to say--and I've
brought it to show you. Read it, dear boy, and tell me your opinion
--but sincerely."


He took a manuscript out of his pocket and gave it to his brother.
The article was called "The Russian Soul"; it was written tediously,
in the colourless style in which people with no talent, but full
of secret vanity, usually write. The leading idea of it was that
the intellectual man has the right to disbelieve in the supernatural,
but it is his duty to conceal his lack of faith, that he may not
be a stumbling-block and shake the faith of others. Without faith
there is no idealism, and idealism is destined to save Europe and
guide humanity into the true path.


"But you don't say what Europe has to be saved from," said Laptev.


"That's intelligible of itself."


"Nothing is intelligible," said Laptev, and he walked about the
room in agitation. "It's not intelligible to me why you wrote it.
But that's your business."


"I want to publish it in pamphlet form."


"That's your affair."


They were silent for a minute. Fyodor sighed and said:


"It's an immense regret to me, dear brother, that we think differently.
Oh, Alyosha, Alyosha, my darling brother! You and I are true Russians,
true believers, men of broad nature; all of these German and Jewish
crochets are not for us. You and I are not wretched upstarts, you
know, but representatives of a distinguished merchant family."


"What do you mean by a distinguished family?" said Laptev, restraining
his irritation. "A distinguished family! The landowners beat our
grandfather and every low little government clerk punched him in
the face. Our grandfather thrashed our father, and our father
thrashed us. What has your distinguished family done for us? What
sort of nerves, what sort of blood, have we inherited? For nearly
three years you've been arguing like an ignorant deacon, and talking
all sorts of nonsense, and now you've written--this slavish drivel
here! While I, while I! Look at me. . . . No elasticity, no boldness,
no strength of will; I tremble over every step I take as though I
should be flogged for it. I am timid before nonentities, idiots,
brutes, who are immeasurably my inferiors mentally and morally; I
am afraid of porters, doorkeepers, policemen, gendarmes. I am afraid
of every one, because I was born of a mother who was terrified, and
because from a child I was beaten and frightened! . . . You and I
will do well to have no children. Oh, God, grant that this distinguished
merchant family may die with us!"


Yulia Sergeyevna came into the study and sat down at the table.


"Are you arguing about something here?" she asked. "Am I interrupting?"


"No, little sister," answered Fyodor. "Our discussion was of
principles. Here, you are abusing the family," he added, turning
to his brother. "That family has created a business worth a million,
though. That stands for something, anyway!"


"A great distinction--a business worth a million! A man with no
particular brains, without abilities, by chance becomes a trader,
and then when he has grown rich he goes on trading from day to day,
with no sort of system, with no aim, without having any particular
greed for money. He trades mechanically, and money comes to him of
itself, without his going to meet it. He sits all his life at his
work, likes it only because he can domineer over his clerks and get
the better of his customers. He's a churchwarden because he can
domineer over the choristers and keep them under his thumb; he's
the patron of a school because he likes to feel the teacher is his
subordinate and enjoys lording it over him. The merchant does not
love trading, he loves dominating, and your warehouse is not so
much a commercial establishment as a torture chamber! And for a
business like yours, you want clerks who have been deprived of
individual character and personal life--and you make them such
by forcing them in childhood to lick the dust for a crust of bread,
and you've trained them from childhood to believe that you are their
benefactors. No fear of your taking a university man into your
warehouse!"


"University men are not suitable for our business."


"That's not true," cried Laptev. "It's a lie!"


"Excuse me, it seems to me you spit into the well from which you
drink yourself," said Fyodor, and he got up. "Our business is hateful
to you, yet you make use of the income from it."


"Aha! We've spoken our minds," said Laptev, and he laughed, looking
angrily at his brother. "Yes, if I didn't belong to your distinguished
family--if I had an ounce of will and courage, I should long ago
have flung away that income, and have gone to work for my living.
But in your warehouse you've destroyed all character in me from a
child! I'm your product."


Fyodor looked at the clock and began hurriedly saying good-bye. He
kissed Yulia's hand and went out, but instead of going into the
hall, walked into the drawing-room, then into the bedroom.


"I've forgotten how the rooms go," he said in extreme confusion.
"It's a strange house. Isn't it a strange house!"


He seemed utterly overcome as he put on his coat, and there was a
look of pain on his face. Laptev felt no more anger; he was frightened,
and at the same time felt sorry for Fyodor, and the warm, true love
for his brother, which seemed to have died down in his heart during
those three years, awoke, and he felt an intense desire to express
that love.


"Come to dinner with us to-morrow, Fyodor," he said, and stroked
him on the shoulder. "Will you come?"


"Yes, yes; but give me some water."


Laptev ran himself to the dining-room to take the first thing he
could get from the sideboard. This was a tall beer-jug. He poured
water into it and brought it to his brother. Fyodor began drinking,
but bit a piece out of the jug; they heard a crunch, and then sobs.
The water ran over his fur coat and his jacket, and Laptev, who had
never seen men cry, stood in confusion and dismay, not knowing what
to do. He looked on helplessly while Yulia and the servant took off
Fyodor's coat and helped him back again into the room, and went
with him, feeling guilty.


Yulia made Fyodor lie down on the sofa and knelt beside him.


"It's nothing," she said, trying to comfort him. "It's your
nerves. . . ."


"I'm so miserable, my dear!" he said. "I am so unhappy, unhappy
. . . but all the time I've been hiding it, I've been hiding it!"


He put his arm round her neck and whispered in her ear:


"Every night I see my sister Nina. She comes and sits in the chair
near my bed. . . ."


When, an hour later, he put on his fur coat in the hall, he was
smiling again and ashamed to face the servant. Laptev went with him
to Pyatnitsky Street.


"Come and have dinner with us to-morrow," he said on the way, holding
him by the arm, "and at Easter we'll go abroad together. You
absolutely must have a change, or you'll be getting quite morbid."


When he got home Laptev found his wife in a state of great nervous
agitation. The scene with Fyodor had upset her, and she could not
recover her composure. She wasn't crying but kept tossing on the
bed, clutching with cold fingers at the quilt, at the pillows, at
her husband's hands. Her eyes looked big and frightened.


"Don't go away from me, don't go away," she said to her husband.
"Tell me, Alyosha, why have I left off saying my prayers? What has
become of my faith? Oh, why did you talk of religion before me?
You've shaken my faith, you and your friends. I never pray now."


He put compresses on her forehead, chafed her hands, gave her tea
to drink, while she huddled up to him in terror. . . .


Towards morning she was worn out and fell asleep, while Laptev sat
beside her and held her hand. So that he could get no sleep. The
whole day afterwards he felt shattered and dull, and wandered
listlessly about the rooms without a thought in his head.



XVI


The doctor said that Fyodor's mind was affected. Laptev did not
know what to do in his father's house, while the dark warehouse in
which neither his father nor Fyodor ever appeared now seemed to him
like a sepulchre. When his wife told him that he absolutely must
go every day to the warehouse and also to his father's, he either
said nothing, or began talking irritably of his childhood, saying
that it was beyond his power to forgive his father for his past,
that the warehouse and the house in Pyatnitsky Street were hateful
to him, and so on.


One Sunday morning Yulia went herself to Pyatnitsky Street. She
found old Fyodor Stepanovitch in the same big drawing-room in which
the service had been held on her first arrival. Wearing slippers,
and without a cravat, he was sitting motionless in his arm-chair,
blinking with his sightless eyes.


"It's I--your daughter-in-law," she said, going up to him. "I've
come to see how you are."


He began breathing heavily with excitement.


Touched by his affliction and his loneliness, she kissed his hand;
and he passed his hand over her face and head, and having satisfied
himself that it was she, made the sign of the cross over her.


"Thank you, thank you," he said. "You know I've lost my eyes and
can see nothing. . . . I can dimly see the window and the fire, but
people and things I cannot see at all. Yes, I'm going blind, and
Fyodor has fallen ill, and without the master's eye things are in
a bad way now. If there is any irregularity there's no one to look
into it; and folks soon get spoiled. And why is it Fyodor has fallen
ill? Did he catch cold? Here I have never ailed in my life and never
taken medicine. I never saw anything of doctors."


And, as he always did, the old man began boasting. Meanwhile the
servants hurriedly laid the table and brought in lunch and bottles
of wine.


Ten bottles were put on the table; one of them was in the shape of
the Eiffel Tower. There was a whole dish of hot pies smelling of
jam, rice, and fish.


"I beg my dear guest to have lunch," said the old man.


She took him by the arm, led him to the table, and poured him out
a glass of vodka.


"I will come to you again to-morrow," she said, "and I'll bring
your grandchildren, Sasha and Lida. They will be sorry for you, and
fondle you."


"There's no need. Don't bring them. They are illegitimate."


"Why are they illegitimate? Why, their father and mother were
married."


"Without my permission. I do not bless them, and I don't want to
know them. Let them be."


"You speak strangely, Fyodor Stepanovitch," said Yulia, with a sigh.


"It is written in the Gospel: children must fear and honour their
parents."


"Nothing of the sort. The Gospel tells us that we must forgive even
our enemies."


"One can't forgive in our business. If you were to forgive every
one, you would come to ruin in three years."


"But to forgive, to say a kind, friendly word to any one, even a
sinner, is something far above business, far above wealth."


Yulia longed to soften the old man, to awaken a feeling of compassion
in him, to move him to repentance; but he only listened condescendingly
to all she said, as a grown-up person listens to a child.


"Fyodor Stepanovitch," said Yulia resolutely, "you are an old man,
and God soon will call you to Himself. He won't ask you how you
managed your business, and whether you were successful in it, but
whether you were gracious to people; or whether you were harsh to
those who were weaker than you, such as your servants, your clerks."


"I was always the benefactor of those that served me; they ought
to remember me in their prayers forever," said the old man, with
conviction, but touched by Yulia's tone of sincerity, and anxious
to give her pleasure, he said: "Very well; bring my grandchildren
to-morrow. I will tell them to buy me some little presents for
them."


The old man was slovenly in his dress, and there was cigar ash on
his breast and on his knees; apparently no one cleaned his boots,
or brushed his clothes. The rice in the pies was half cooked, the
tablecloth smelt of soap, the servants tramped noisily about the
room. And the old man and the whole house had a neglected look, and
Yulia, who felt this, was ashamed of herself and of her husband.


"I will be sure to come and see you to-morrow," she said.


She walked through the rooms, and gave orders for the old man's
bedroom to be set to rights, and the lamp to be lighted under the
ikons in it. Fyodor, sitting in his own room, was looking at an
open book without reading it. Yulia talked to him and told the
servants to tidy his room, too; then she went downstairs to the
clerks. In the middle of the room where the clerks used to dine,
there was an unpainted wooden post to support the ceiling and to
prevent its coming down. The ceilings in the basement were low, the
walls covered with cheap paper, and there was a smell of charcoal
fumes and cooking. As it was a holiday, all the clerks were at home,
sitting on their bedsteads waiting for dinner. When Yulia went in
they jumped up, and answered her questions timidly, looking up at
her from under their brows like convicts.


"Good heavens! What a horrid room you have!" she said, throwing up
her hands. "Aren't you crowded here?"


"Crowded, but not aggrieved," said Makeitchev. "We are greatly
indebted to you, and will offer up our prayers for you to our
Heavenly Father."


"The congruity of life with the conceit of the personality," said
Potchatkin.


And noticing that Yulia did not understand Potchatkin, Makeitchev
hastened to explain:


"We are humble people and must live according to our position."


She inspected the boys' quarters, and then the kitchen, made
acquaintance with the housekeeper, and was thoroughly dissatisfied.


When she got home she said to her husband:


"We ought to move into your father's house and settle there for
good as soon as possible. And you will go every day to the warehouse."


Then they both sat side by side in the study without speaking. His
heart was heavy, and he did not want to move into Pyatnitsky Street
or to go into the warehouse; but he guessed what his wife was
thinking, and could not oppose her. He stroked her cheek and said:


"I feel as though our life is already over, and that a grey half-life
is beginning for us. When I knew that my brother Fyodor was hopelessly
ill, I shed tears; we spent our childhood and youth together, when
I loved him with my whole soul. And now this catastrophe has come,
and it seems, too, as though, losing him, I am finally cut away
from my past. And when you said just now that we must move into the
house in Pyatnitsky Street, to that prison, it began to seem to me
that there was no future for me either."


He got up and walked to the window.


"However that may be, one has to give up all thoughts of happiness,"
he said, looking out into the street. "There is none. I never have
had any, and I suppose it doesn't exist at all. I was happy once
in my life, though, when I sat at night under your parasol. Do you
remember how you left your parasol at Nina's?" he asked, turning
to his wife. "I was in love with you then, and I remember I spent
all night sitting under your parasol, and was perfectly blissful."


Near the book-case in the study stood a mahogany chest with bronze
fittings where Laptev kept various useless things, including the
parasol. He took it out and handed it to his wife.


"Here it is."


Yulia looked for a minute at the parasol, recognised it, and smiled
mournfully.


"I remember," she said. "When you proposed to me you held it in
your hand." And seeing that he was preparing to go out, she said:
"Please come back early if you can. I am dull without you."


And then she went into her own room, and gazed for a long time at
the parasol.



XVII


In spite of the complexity of the business and the immense turnover,
there were no bookkeepers in the warehouse, and it was impossible
to make anything out of the books kept by the cashier in the office.
Every day the warehouse was visited by agents, German and English,
with whom the clerks talked politics and religion. A man of noble
birth, ruined by drink, an ailing, pitiable creature, used to come
to translate the foreign correspondence in the office; the clerks
used to call him a midge, and put salt in his tea. And altogether
the whole concern struck Laptev as a very queer business.


He went to the warehouse every day and tried to establish a new
order of things; he forbade them to thrash the boys and to jeer at
the buyers, and was violently angry when the clerks gleefully
despatched to the provinces worthless shop-soiled goods as though
they were new and fashionable. Now he was the chief person in the
warehouse, but still, as before, he did not know how large his
fortune was, whether his business was doing well, how much the
senior clerks were paid, and so on. Potchatkin and Makeitchev looked
upon him as young and inexperienced, concealed a great deal from
him, and whispered mysteriously every evening with his blind old
father.


It somehow happened at the beginning of June that Laptev went into
the Bubnovsky restaurant with Potchatkin to talk business with him
over lunch. Potchatkin had been with the Laptevs a long while, and
had entered their service at eight years old. He seemed to belong
to them--they trusted him fully; and when on leaving the warehouse
he gathered up all the takings from the till and thrust them into
his pocket, it never aroused the slightest suspicion. He was the
head man in the business and in the house, and also in the church,
where he performed the duties of churchwarden in place of his old
master. He was nicknamed Malyuta Skuratov on account of his cruel
treatment of the boys and clerks under him.


When they went into the restaurant he nodded to a waiter and said:


"Bring us, my lad, half a bodkin and twenty-four unsavouries."


After a brief pause the waiter brought on a tray half a bottle of
vodka and some plates of various kinds of savouries.


"Look here, my good fellow," said Potchatkin. "Give us a plateful
of the source of all slander and evil-speaking, with mashed potatoes."


The waiter did not understand; he was puzzled, and would have said
something, but Potchatkin looked at him sternly and said:


"Except."


The waiter thought intently, then went to consult with his colleagues,
and in the end guessing what was meant, brought a plateful of tongue.
When they had drunk a couple of glasses and had had lunch, Laptev
asked:


"Tell me, Ivan Vassilitch, is it true that our business has been
dropping off for the last year?"


"Not a bit of it."


"Tell me frankly and honestly what income we have been making and
are making, and what our profits are. We can't go on in the dark.
We had a balancing of the accounts at the warehouse lately, but,
excuse me, I don't believe in it; you think fit to conceal something
from me and only tell the truth to my father. You have been used
to being diplomatic from your childhood, and now you can't get on
without it. And what's the use of it? So I beg you to be open. What
is our position?"


"It all depends upon the fluctuation of credit," Potchatkin answered
after a moment's pause.


"What do you understand by the fluctuation of credit?"


Potchatkin began explaining, but Laptev could make nothing of it,
and sent for Makeitchev. The latter promptly made his appearance,
had some lunch after saying grace, and in his sedate, mellow baritone
began saying first of all that the clerks were in duty bound to
pray night and day for their benefactors.


"By all means, only allow me not to consider myself your benefactor,"
said Laptev.


"Every man ought to remember what he is, and to be conscious of his
station. By the grace of God you are a father and benefactor to us,
and we are your slaves."


"I am sick of all that!" said Laptev, getting angry. "Please be a
benefactor to me now. Please explain the position of our business.
Give up looking upon me as a boy, or to-morrow I shall close the
business. My father is blind, my brother is in the asylum, my nieces
are only children. I hate the business; I should be glad to go away,
but there's no one to take my place, as you know. For goodness'
sake, drop your diplomacy!"


They went to the warehouse to go into the accounts; then they went
on with them at home in the evening, the old father himself assisting.
Initiating his son into his commercial secrets, the old man spoke
as though he were engaged, not in trade, but in sorcery. It appeared
that the profits of the business were increasing approximately ten
per cent. per annum, and that the Laptevs' fortune, reckoning only
money and paper securities, amounted to six million roubles.


When at one o'clock at night, after balancing the accounts, Laptev
went out into the open air, he was still under the spell of those
figures. It was a still, sultry, moonlight night. The white walls
of the houses beyond the river, the heavy barred gates, the stillness
and the black shadows, combined to give the impression of a fortress,
and nothing was wanting to complete the picture but a sentinel with
a gun. Laptev went into the garden and sat down on a seat near the
fence, which divided them from the neighbour's yard, where there
was a garden, too. The bird-cherry was in bloom. Laptev remembered
that the tree had been just as gnarled and just as big when he was
a child, and had not changed at all since then. Every corner of the
garden and of the yard recalled the far-away past. And in his
childhood, too, just as now, the whole yard bathed in moonlight
could be seen through the sparse trees, the shadows had been
mysterious and forbidding, a black dog had lain in the middle of
the yard, and the clerks' windows had stood wide open. And all these
were cheerless memories.


The other side of the fence, in the neighbour's yard, there was a
sound of light steps.


"My sweet, my precious . . ." said a man's voice so near the fence
that Laptev could hear the man's breathing.


Now they were kissing. Laptev was convinced that the millions and
the business which was so distasteful to him were ruining his life,
and would make him a complete slave. He imagined how, little by
little, he would grow accustomed to his position; would, little by
little, enter into the part of the head of a great firm; would begin
to grow dull and old, die in the end, as the average man usually
does die, in a decrepit, soured old age, making every one about him
miserable and depressed. But what hindered him from giving up those
millions and that business, and leaving that yard and garden which
had been hateful to him from his childhood?


The whispering and kisses the other side of the fence disturbed
him. He moved into the middle of the yard, and, unbuttoning his
shirt over his chest, looked at the moon, and it seemed to him that
he would order the gate to be unlocked, and would go out and never
come back again. His heart ached sweetly with the foretaste of
freedom; he laughed joyously, and pictured how exquisite, poetical,
and even holy, life might be. . . .


But he still stood and did not go away, and kept asking himself:
"What keeps me here?" And he felt angry with himself and with the
black dog, which still lay stretched on the stone yard, instead of
running off to the open country, to the woods, where it would have
been free and happy. It was clear that that dog and he were prevented
from leaving the yard by the same thing; the habit of bondage, of
servitude. . . .


At midday next morning he went to see his wife, and that he might
not be dull, asked Yartsev to go with him. Yulia Sergeyevna was
staying in a summer villa at Butovo, and he had not been to see her
for five days. When they reached the station the friends got into
a carriage, and all the way there Yartsev was singing and in raptures
over the exquisite weather. The villa was in a great park not far
from the station. At the beginning of an avenue, about twenty paces
from the gates, Yulia Sergeyevna was sitting under a broad, spreading
poplar, waiting for her guests. She had on a light, elegant dress
of a pale cream colour trimmed with lace, and in her hand she had
the old familiar parasol. Yartsev greeted her and went on to the
villa from which came the sound of Sasha's and Lida's voices, while
Laptev sat down beside her to talk of business matters.


"Why is it you haven't been for so long?" she said, keeping his
hand in hers. "I have been sitting here for days watching for you
to come. I miss you so when you are away!"


She stood up and passed her hand over his hair, and scanned his
face, his shoulders, his hat, with interest.


"You know I love you," she said, and flushed crimson. "You are
precious to me. Here you've come. I see you, and I'm so happy I
can't tell you. Well, let us talk. Tell me something."


She had told him she loved him, and he could only feel as though
he had been married to her for ten years, and that he was hungry
for his lunch. She had put her arm round his neck, tickling his
cheek with the silk of her dress; he cautiously removed her hand,
stood up, and without uttering a single word, walked to the villa.
The little girls ran to meet him.


"How they have grown!" he thought. "And what changes in these three
years. . . . But one may have to live another thirteen years, another
thirty years. . . . What is there in store for us in the future?
If we live, we shall see."


He embraced Sasha and Lida, who hung upon his neck, and said:


"Grandpapa sends his love. . . . Uncle Fyodor is dying. Uncle Kostya
has sent a letter from America and sends you his love in it. He's
bored at the exhibition and will soon be back. And Uncle Alyosha
is hungry."


Then he sat on the verandah and saw his wife walking slowly along
the avenue towards the house. She was deep in thought; there was a
mournful, charming expression in her face, and her eyes were bright
with tears. She was not now the slender, fragile, pale-faced girl
she used to be; she was a mature, beautiful, vigorous woman. And
Laptev saw the enthusiasm with which Yartsev looked at her when he
met her, and the way her new, lovely expression was reflected in
his face, which looked mournful and ecstatic too. One would have
thought that he was seeing her for the first time in his life. And
while they were at lunch on the verandah, Yartsev smiled with a
sort of joyous shyness, and kept gazing at Yulia and at her beautiful
neck. Laptev could not help watching them while he thought that he
had perhaps another thirteen, another thirty years of life before
him. . . . And what would he have to live through in that time?
What is in store for us in the future?


And he thought:


"Let us live, and we shall see."
