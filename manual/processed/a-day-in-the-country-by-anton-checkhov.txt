A DAY IN THE COUNTRY
    

      BETWEEN eight and nine o’clock in the morning.
    

A dark
      leaden-coloured mass is creeping over the sky towards the sun. Red zigzags
      of lightning gleam here and there across it. There is a sound of far-away
      rumbling. A warm wind frolics over the grass, bends the trees, and stirs
      up the dust. In a minute there will be a spurt of May rain and a real
      storm will begin.
    

      Fyokla, a little beggar-girl of six, is running through the village,
      looking for Terenty the cobbler. The white-haired, barefoot child is pale.
      Her eyes are wide-open, her lips are trembling.
    

      “Uncle, where is Terenty?” she asks every one she meets. No
      one answers. They are all preoccupied with the approaching storm and take
      refuge in their huts. At last she meets Silanty Silitch, the sacristan,
      Terenty’s bosom friend. He is coming along, staggering from the
      wind.
    

      “Uncle, where is Terenty?”
    

      “At the kitchen-gardens,” answers Silanty.
    

      The beggar-girl runs behind the huts to the kitchen-gardens and there
      finds Terenty; the tall old man with a thin, pock-marked face, very long
      legs, and bare feet, dressed in a woman’s tattered jacket, is
      standing near the vegetable plots, looking with drowsy, drunken eyes at
      the dark storm-cloud. On his long crane-like legs he sways in the wind
      like a starling-cote.
    

      “Uncle Terenty!” the white-headed beggar-girl addresses him.
      “Uncle, darling!”
    

      Terenty bends down to Fyokla, and his grim, drunken face is overspread
      with a smile, such as come into people’s faces when they look at
      something little, foolish, and absurd, but warmly loved.
    

      “Ah! servant of God, Fyokia,” he says, lisping tenderly,
      “where have you come from?”
    

      “Uncle Terenty,” says Fyokia, with a sob, tugging at the lapel
      of the cobbler’s coat. “Brother Danilka has had an accident!
      Come along!”
    

      “What sort of accident? Ough, what thunder! Holy, holy, holy. . . .
      What sort of accident?”
    

      “In the count’s copse Danilka stuck his hand into a hole in a
      tree, and he can’t get it out. Come along, uncle, do be kind and
      pull his hand out!”
    

      “How was it he put his hand in? What for?”
    

      “He wanted to get a cuckoo’s egg out of the hole for me.”
    

      “The day has hardly begun and already you are in trouble. . . .”
      Terenty shook his head and spat deliberately. “Well, what am I to do
      with you now? I must come . . . I must, may the wolf gobble you up, you
      naughty children! Come, little orphan!”
    

      Terenty comes out of the kitchen-garden and, lifting high his long legs,
      begins striding down the village street. He walks quickly without stopping
      or looking from side to side, as though he were shoved from behind or
      afraid of pursuit. Fyokla can hardly keep up with him.
    

      They come out of the village and turn along the dusty road towards the
      count’s copse that lies dark blue in the distance. It is about a
      mile and a half away. The clouds have by now covered the sun, and soon
      afterwards there is not a speck of blue left in the sky. It grows dark.
    

      “Holy, holy, holy . . .” whispers Fyokla, hurrying after
      Terenty. The first rain-drops, big and heavy, lie, dark dots on the dusty
      road. A big drop falls on Fyokla’s cheek and glides like a tear down
      her chin.
    

      “The rain has begun,” mutters the cobbler, kicking up the dust
      with his bare, bony feet. “That’s fine, Fyokla, old girl. The
      grass and the trees are fed by the rain, as we are by bread. And as for
      the thunder, don’t you be frightened, little orphan. Why should it
      kill a little thing like you?”
    

      As soon as the rain begins, the wind drops. The only sound is the patter
      of rain dropping like fine shot on the young rye and the parched road.
    

      “We shall get soaked, Fyolka,” mutters Terenty. “There
      won’t be a dry spot left on us. . . . Ho-ho, my girl! It’s run
      down my neck! But don’t be frightened, silly. . . . The grass will
      be dry again, the earth will be dry again, and we shall be dry again.
      There is the same sun for us all.”
    

      A flash of lightning, some fourteen feet long, gleams above their heads.
      There is a loud peal of thunder, and it seems to Fyokla that something
      big, heavy, and round is rolling over the sky and tearing it open, exactly
      over her head.
    

      “Holy, holy, holy . . .” says Terenty, crossing himself.
      “Don’t be afraid, little orphan! It is not from spite that it
      thunders.”
    

      Terenty’s and Fyokla’s feet are covered with lumps of heavy,
      wet clay. It is slippery and difficult to walk, but Terenty strides on
      more and more rapidly. The weak little beggar-girl is breathless and ready
      to drop.
    

      But at last they go into the count’s copse. The washed trees,
      stirred by a gust of wind, drop a perfect waterfall upon them. Terenty
      stumbles over stumps and begins to slacken his pace.
    

      “Whereabouts is Danilka?” he asks. “Lead me to him.”
    

      Fyokla leads him into a thicket, and, after going a quarter of a mile,
      points to Danilka. Her brother, a little fellow of eight, with hair as red
      as ochre and a pale sickly face, stands leaning against a tree, and, with
      his head on one side, looking sideways at the sky. In one hand he holds
      his shabby old cap, the other is hidden in an old lime tree. The boy is
      gazing at the stormy sky, and apparently not thinking of his trouble.
      Hearing footsteps and seeing the cobbler he gives a sickly smile and says:
    

      “A terrible lot of thunder, Terenty. . . . I’ve never heard so
      much thunder in all my life.”
    

      “And where is your hand?”
    

      “In the hole. . . . Pull it out, please, Terenty!”
    

      The wood had broken at the edge of the hole and jammed Danilka’s
      hand: he could push it farther in, but could not pull it out. Terenty
      snaps off the broken piece, and the boy’s hand, red and crushed, is
      released.
    

      “It’s terrible how it’s thundering,” the boy says
      again, rubbing his hand. “What makes it thunder, Terenty?”
    

      “One cloud runs against the other,” answers the cobbler. The
      party come out of the copse, and walk along the edge of it towards the
      darkened road. The thunder gradually abates, and its rumbling is heard far
      away beyond the village.
    

      “The ducks flew by here the other day, Terenty,” says Danilka,
      still rubbing his hand. “They must be nesting in the Gniliya
      Zaimishtcha marshes. . . . Fyolka, would you like me to show you a
      nightingale’s nest?”
    

      “Don’t touch it, you might disturb them,” says Terenty,
      wringing the water out of his cap. “The nightingale is a
      singing-bird, without sin. He has had a voice given him in his throat, to
      praise God and gladden the heart of man. It’s a sin to disturb him.”
    

      “What about the sparrow?”
    

      “The sparrow doesn’t matter, he’s a bad, spiteful bird.
      He is like a pickpocket in his ways. He doesn’t like man to be
      happy. When Christ was crucified it was the sparrow brought nails to the
      Jews, and called ‘alive! alive!’”
    

      A bright patch of blue appears in the sky.
    

      “Look!” says Terenty. “An ant-heap burst open by the
      rain! They’ve been flooded, the rogues!”
    

      They bend over the ant-heap. The downpour has damaged it; the insects are
      scurrying to and fro in the mud, agitated, and busily trying to carry away
      their drowned companions.
    

      “You needn’t be in such a taking, you won’t die of it!”
      says Terenty, grinning. “As soon as the sun warms you, you’ll
      come to your senses again. . . . It’s a lesson to you, you stupids.
      You won’t settle on low ground another time.”
    

      They go on.
    

      “And here are some bees,” cries Danilka, pointing to the
      branch of a young oak tree.
    

      The drenched and chilled bees are huddled together on the branch. There
      are so many of them that neither bark nor leaf can be seen. Many of them
      are settled on one another.
    

      “That’s a swarm of bees,” Terenty informs them. “They
      were flying looking for a home, and when the rain came down upon them they
      settled. If a swarm is flying, you need only sprinkle water on them to
      make them settle. Now if, say, you wanted to take the swarm, you would
      bend the branch with them into a sack and shake it, and they all fall in.”
    

      Little Fyokla suddenly frowns and rubs her neck vigorously. Her brother
      looks at her neck, and sees a big swelling on it.
    

      “Hey-hey!” laughs the cobbler. “Do you know where you
      got that from, Fyokia, old girl? There are Spanish flies on some tree in
      the wood. The rain has trickled off them, and a drop has fallen on your
      neck —that’s what has made the swelling.”
    

      The sun appears from behind the clouds and floods the wood, the fields,
      and the three friends with its warm light. The dark menacing cloud has
      gone far away and taken the storm with it. The air is warm and fragrant.
      There is a scent of bird-cherry, meadowsweet, and lilies-of-the-valley.
    

      “That herb is given when your nose bleeds,” says Terenty,
      pointing to a woolly-looking flower. “It does good.”
    

      They hear a whistle and a rumble, but not such a rumble as the
      storm-clouds carried away. A goods train races by before the eyes of
      Terenty, Danilka, and Fyokla. The engine, panting and puffing out black
      smoke, drags more than twenty vans after it. Its power is tremendous. The
      children are interested to know how an engine, not alive and without the
      help of horses, can move and drag such weights, and Terenty undertakes to
      explain it to them:
    

      “It’s all the steam’s doing, children. . . . The steam
      does the work. . . . You see, it shoves under that thing near the wheels,
      and it . . . you see . . . it works. . . .”
    

      They cross the railway line, and, going down from the embankment, walk
      towards the river. They walk not with any object, but just at random, and
      talk all the way. . . . Danilka asks questions, Terenty answers them. . .
      .
    

      Terenty answers all his questions, and there is no secret in Nature which
      baffles him. He knows everything. Thus, for example, he knows the names of
      all the wild flowers, animals, and stones. He knows what herbs cure
      diseases, he has no difficulty in telling the age of a horse or a cow.
      Looking at the sunset, at the moon, or the birds, he can tell what sort of
      weather it will be next day. And indeed, it is not only Terenty who is so
      wise. Silanty Silitch, the innkeeper, the market-gardener, the shepherd,
      and all the villagers, generally speaking, know as much as he does. These
      people have learned not from books, but in the fields, in the wood, on the
      river bank. Their teachers have been the birds themselves, when they sang
      to them, the sun when it left a glow of crimson behind it at setting, the
      very trees, and wild herbs.
    

      Danilka looks at Terenty and greedily drinks in every word. In spring,
      before one is weary of the warmth and the monotonous green of the fields,
      when everything is fresh and full of fragrance, who would not want to hear
      about the golden may-beetles, about the cranes, about the gurgling
      streams, and the corn mounting into ear?
    

      The two of them, the cobbler and the orphan, walk about the fields, talk
      unceasingly, and are not weary. They could wander about the world
      endlessly. They walk, and in their talk of the beauty of the earth do not
      notice the frail little beggar-girl tripping after them. She is breathless
      and moves with a lagging step. There are tears in her eyes; she would be
      glad to stop these inexhaustible wanderers, but to whom and where can she
      go? She has no home or people of her own; whether she likes it or not, she
      must walk and listen to their talk.
    

      Towards midday, all three sit down on the river bank. Danilka takes out of
      his bag a piece of bread, soaked and reduced to a mash, and they begin to
      eat. Terenty says a prayer when he has eaten the bread, then stretches
      himself on the sandy bank and falls asleep. While he is asleep, the boy
      gazes at the water, pondering. He has many different things to think of.
      He has just seen the storm, the bees, the ants, the train. Now, before his
      eyes, fishes are whisking about. Some are two inches long and more, others
      are no bigger than one’s nail. A viper, with its head held high, is
      swimming from one bank to the other.
    

      Only towards the evening our wanderers return to the village. The children
      go for the night to a deserted barn, where the corn of the commune used to
      be kept, while Terenty, leaving them, goes to the tavern. The children lie
      huddled together on the straw, dozing.
    

      The boy does not sleep. He gazes into the darkness, and it seems to him
      that he is seeing all that he has seen in the day: the storm-clouds, the
      bright sunshine, the birds, the fish, lanky Terenty. The number of his
      impressions, together with exhaustion and hunger, are too much for him; he
      is as hot as though he were on fire, and tosses from, side to side. He
      longs to tell someone all that is haunting him now in the darkness and
      agitating his soul, but there is no one to tell. Fyokla is too little and
      could not understand.
    

      “I’ll tell Terenty to-morrow,” thinks the boy.
    

      The children fall asleep thinking of the homeless cobbler, and, in the
      night, Terenty comes to them, makes the sign of the cross over them, and
      puts bread under their heads. And no one sees his love. It is seen only by
      the moon which floats in the sky and peeps caressingly through the holes
      in the wall of the deserted barn.
