THE SISTERS

 There was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke. Night after night
I had passed the house (it was vacation time) and studied the lighted square of
window: and night after night I had found it lighted in the same way, faintly
and evenly. If he was dead, I thought, I would see the reflection of candles on
the darkened blind for I knew that two candles must be set at the head of a
corpse. He had often said to me: “I am not long for this world,”
and I had thought his words idle. Now I knew they were true. Every night as I
gazed up at the window I said softly to myself the word paralysis. It had
always sounded strangely in my ears, like the word gnomon in the Euclid and the
word simony in the Catechism. But now it sounded to me like the name of some
maleficent and sinful being. It filled me with fear, and yet I longed to be
nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work.

 Old Cotter was sitting at the fire, smoking, when I came downstairs to supper.
While my aunt was ladling out my stirabout he said, as if returning to some
former remark of his:

 “No, I wouldn’t say he was exactly ... but there was something
queer ... there was something uncanny about him. I’ll tell you my
opinion....”

 He began to puff at his pipe, no doubt arranging his opinion in his mind.
Tiresome old fool! When we knew him first he used to be rather interesting,
talking of faints and worms; but I soon grew tired of him and his endless
stories about the distillery.

 “I have my own theory about it,” he said. “I think it was one
of those ... peculiar cases.... But it’s hard to say....”

 He began to puff again at his pipe without giving us his theory. My uncle saw
me staring and said to me:

 “Well, so your old friend is gone, you’ll be sorry to hear.”

 “Who?” said I.

 “Father Flynn.”

 “Is he dead?”

 “Mr Cotter here has just told us. He was passing by the house.”

 I knew that I was under observation so I continued eating as if the news had
not interested me. My uncle explained to old Cotter.

 “The youngster and he were great friends. The old chap taught him a great
deal, mind you; and they say he had a great wish for him.”

 “God have mercy on his soul,” said my aunt piously.

 Old Cotter looked at me for a while. I felt that his little beady black eyes
were examining me but I would not satisfy him by looking up from my plate. He
returned to his pipe and finally spat rudely into the grate.

 “I wouldn’t like children of mine,” he said, “to have
too much to say to a man like that.”

 “How do you mean, Mr Cotter?” asked my aunt.

 “What I mean is,” said old Cotter, “it’s bad for
children. My idea is: let a young lad run about and play with young lads of his
own age and not be.... Am I right, Jack?”

 “That’s my principle, too,” said my uncle. “Let him
learn to box his corner. That’s what I’m always saying to that
Rosicrucian there: take exercise. Why, when I was a nipper every morning of my
life I had a cold bath, winter and summer. And that’s what stands to me
now. Education is all very fine and large.... Mr Cotter might take a pick of
that leg mutton,” he added to my aunt.

 “No, no, not for me,” said old Cotter.

 My aunt brought the dish from the safe and put it on the table.

 “But why do you think it’s not good for children, Mr Cotter?”
she asked.

 “It’s bad for children,” said old Cotter, “because
their minds are so impressionable. When children see things like that, you
know, it has an effect....”

 I crammed my mouth with stirabout for fear I might give utterance to my anger.
Tiresome old red-nosed imbecile!

 It was late when I fell asleep. Though I was angry with old Cotter for alluding
to me as a child, I puzzled my head to extract meaning from his unfinished
sentences. In the dark of my room I imagined that I saw again the heavy grey
face of the paralytic. I drew the blankets over my head and tried to think of
Christmas. But the grey face still followed me. It murmured; and I understood
that it desired to confess something. I felt my soul receding into some
pleasant and vicious region; and there again I found it waiting for me. It
began to confess to me in a murmuring voice and I wondered why it smiled
continually and why the lips were so moist with spittle. But then I remembered
that it had died of paralysis and I felt that I too was smiling feebly as if to
absolve the simoniac of his sin.

 The next morning after breakfast I went down to look at the little house in
Great Britain Street. It was an unassuming shop, registered under the vague
name of Drapery . The drapery consisted mainly of children’s
bootees and umbrellas; and on ordinary days a notice used to hang in the
window, saying: Umbrellas Re-covered . No notice was visible now for the
shutters were up. A crape bouquet was tied to the door-knocker with ribbon. Two
poor women and a telegram boy were reading the card pinned on the crape. I also
approached and read:

 July 1st, 1895 

The Rev. James Flynn (formerly of S. Catherine’s 

Church, Meath Street), aged sixty-five years. 

 R. I. P. 

 The reading of the card persuaded me that he was dead and I was disturbed to
find myself at check. Had he not been dead I would have gone into the little
dark room behind the shop to find him sitting in his arm-chair by the fire,
nearly smothered in his great-coat. Perhaps my aunt would have given me a
packet of High Toast for him and this present would have roused him from his
stupefied doze. It was always I who emptied the packet into his black snuff-box
for his hands trembled too much to allow him to do this without spilling half
the snuff about the floor. Even as he raised his large trembling hand to his
nose little clouds of smoke dribbled through his fingers over the front of his
coat. It may have been these constant showers of snuff which gave his ancient
priestly garments their green faded look for the red handkerchief, blackened,
as it always was, with the snuff-stains of a week, with which he tried to brush
away the fallen grains, was quite inefficacious.

 I wished to go in and look at him but I had not the courage to knock. I walked
away slowly along the sunny side of the street, reading all the theatrical
advertisements in the shop-windows as I went. I found it strange that neither I
nor the day seemed in a mourning mood and I felt even annoyed at discovering in
myself a sensation of freedom as if I had been freed from something by his
death. I wondered at this for, as my uncle had said the night before, he had
taught me a great deal. He had studied in the Irish college in Rome and he had
taught me to pronounce Latin properly. He had told me stories about the
catacombs and about Napoleon Bonaparte, and he had explained to me the meaning
of the different ceremonies of the Mass and of the different vestments worn by
the priest. Sometimes he had amused himself by putting difficult questions to
me, asking me what one should do in certain circumstances or whether such and
such sins were mortal or venial or only imperfections. His questions showed me
how complex and mysterious were certain institutions of the Church which I had
always regarded as the simplest acts. The duties of the priest towards the
Eucharist and towards the secrecy of the confessional seemed so grave to me
that I wondered how anybody had ever found in himself the courage to undertake
them; and I was not surprised when he told me that the fathers of the Church
had written books as thick as the Post Office Directory and as closely
printed as the law notices in the newspaper, elucidating all these intricate
questions. Often when I thought of this I could make no answer or only a very
foolish and halting one upon which he used to smile and nod his head twice or
thrice. Sometimes he used to put me through the responses of the Mass which he
had made me learn by heart; and, as I pattered, he used to smile pensively and
nod his head, now and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril
alternately. When he smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured teeth and
let his tongue lie upon his lower lip—a habit which had made me feel
uneasy in the beginning of our acquaintance before I knew him well.

 As I walked along in the sun I remembered old Cotter’s words and tried to
remember what had happened afterwards in the dream. I remembered that I had
noticed long velvet curtains and a swinging lamp of antique fashion. I felt
that I had been very far away, in some land where the customs were
strange—in Persia, I thought.... But I could not remember the end of the
dream.

 In the evening my aunt took me with her to visit the house of mourning. It was
after sunset; but the window-panes of the houses that looked to the west
reflected the tawny gold of a great bank of clouds. Nannie received us in the
hall; and, as it would have been unseemly to have shouted at her, my aunt shook
hands with her for all. The old woman pointed upwards interrogatively and, on
my aunt’s nodding, proceeded to toil up the narrow staircase before us,
her bowed head being scarcely above the level of the banister-rail. At the
first landing she stopped and beckoned us forward encouragingly towards the
open door of the dead-room. My aunt went in and the old woman, seeing that I
hesitated to enter, began to beckon to me again repeatedly with her hand.

 I went in on tiptoe. The room through the lace end of the blind was suffused
with dusky golden light amid which the candles looked like pale thin flames. He
had been coffined. Nannie gave the lead and we three knelt down at the foot of
the bed. I pretended to pray but I could not gather my thoughts because the old
woman’s mutterings distracted me. I noticed how clumsily her skirt was
hooked at the back and how the heels of her cloth boots were trodden down all
to one side. The fancy came to me that the old priest was smiling as he lay
there in his coffin.

 But no. When we rose and went up to the head of the bed I saw that he was not
smiling. There he lay, solemn and copious, vested as for the altar, his large
hands loosely retaining a chalice. His face was very truculent, grey and
massive, with black cavernous nostrils and circled by a scanty white fur. There
was a heavy odour in the room—the flowers.

 We blessed ourselves and came away. In the little room downstairs we found
Eliza seated in his arm-chair in state. I groped my way towards my usual chair
in the corner while Nannie went to the sideboard and brought out a decanter of
sherry and some wine-glasses. She set these on the table and invited us to take
a little glass of wine. Then, at her sister’s bidding, she filled out the
sherry into the glasses and passed them to us. She pressed me to take some
cream crackers also but I declined because I thought I would make too much
noise eating them. She seemed to be somewhat disappointed at my refusal and
went over quietly to the sofa where she sat down behind her sister. No one
spoke: we all gazed at the empty fireplace.

 My aunt waited until Eliza sighed and then said:

 “Ah, well, he’s gone to a better world.”

 Eliza sighed again and bowed her head in assent. My aunt fingered the stem of
her wine-glass before sipping a little.

 “Did he ... peacefully?” she asked.

 “Oh, quite peacefully, ma’am,” said Eliza. “You
couldn’t tell when the breath went out of him. He had a beautiful death,
God be praised.”

 “And everything...?”

 “Father O’Rourke was in with him a Tuesday and anointed him and
prepared him and all.”

 “He knew then?”

 “He was quite resigned.”

 “He looks quite resigned,” said my aunt.

 “That’s what the woman we had in to wash him said. She said he just
looked as if he was asleep, he looked that peaceful and resigned. No one would
think he’d make such a beautiful corpse.”

 “Yes, indeed,” said my aunt.

 She sipped a little more from her glass and said:

 “Well, Miss Flynn, at any rate it must be a great comfort for you to know
that you did all you could for him. You were both very kind to him, I must
say.”

 Eliza smoothed her dress over her knees.

 “Ah, poor James!” she said. “God knows we done all we could,
as poor as we are—we wouldn’t see him want anything while he was in
it.”

 Nannie had leaned her head against the sofa-pillow and seemed about to fall
asleep.

 “There’s poor Nannie,” said Eliza, looking at her,
“she’s wore out. All the work we had, she and me, getting in the
woman to wash him and then laying him out and then the coffin and then
arranging about the Mass in the chapel. Only for Father O’Rourke I
don’t know what we’d have done at all. It was him brought us all
them flowers and them two candlesticks out of the chapel and wrote out the
notice for the Freeman’s General and took charge of all the papers
for the cemetery and poor James’s insurance.”

 “Wasn’t that good of him?” said my aunt.

 Eliza closed her eyes and shook her head slowly.

 “Ah, there’s no friends like the old friends,” she said,
“when all is said and done, no friends that a body can trust.”

 “Indeed, that’s true,” said my aunt. “And I’m
sure now that he’s gone to his eternal reward he won’t forget you
and all your kindness to him.”

 “Ah, poor James!” said Eliza. “He was no great trouble to us.
You wouldn’t hear him in the house any more than now. Still, I know
he’s gone and all to that....”

 “It’s when it’s all over that you’ll miss him,”
said my aunt.

 “I know that,” said Eliza. “I won’t be bringing him in
his cup of beef-tea any more, nor you, ma’am, sending him his snuff. Ah,
poor James!”

 She stopped, as if she were communing with the past and then said shrewdly:

 “Mind you, I noticed there was something queer coming over him latterly.
Whenever I’d bring in his soup to him there I’d find him with his
breviary fallen to the floor, lying back in the chair and his mouth
open.”

 She laid a finger against her nose and frowned: then she continued:

 “But still and all he kept on saying that before the summer was over
he’d go out for a drive one fine day just to see the old house again
where we were all born down in Irishtown and take me and Nannie with him. If we
could only get one of them new-fangled carriages that makes no noise that
Father O’Rourke told him about, them with the rheumatic wheels, for the
day cheap—he said, at Johnny Rush’s over the way there and drive
out the three of us together of a Sunday evening. He had his mind set on
that.... Poor James!”

 “The Lord have mercy on his soul!” said my aunt.

 Eliza took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes with it. Then she put it
back again in her pocket and gazed into the empty grate for some time without
speaking.

 “He was too scrupulous always,” she said. “The duties of the
priesthood was too much for him. And then his life was, you might say,
crossed.”

 “Yes,” said my aunt. “He was a disappointed man. You could
see that.”

 A silence took possession of the little room and, under cover of it, I
approached the table and tasted my sherry and then returned quietly to my chair
in the corner. Eliza seemed to have fallen into a deep revery. We waited
respectfully for her to break the silence: and after a long pause she said
slowly:

 “It was that chalice he broke.... That was the beginning of it. Of
course, they say it was all right, that it contained nothing, I mean. But
still.... They say it was the boy’s fault. But poor James was so nervous,
God be merciful to him!”

 “And was that it?” said my aunt. “I heard
something....”

 Eliza nodded.

 “That affected his mind,” she said. “After that he began to
mope by himself, talking to no one and wandering about by himself. So one night
he was wanted for to go on a call and they couldn’t find him anywhere.
They looked high up and low down; and still they couldn’t see a sight of
him anywhere. So then the clerk suggested to try the chapel. So then they got
the keys and opened the chapel and the clerk and Father O’Rourke and
another priest that was there brought in a light for to look for him.... And
what do you think but there he was, sitting up by himself in the dark in his
confession-box, wide-awake and laughing-like softly to himself?”

 She stopped suddenly as if to listen. I too listened; but there was no sound in
the house: and I knew that the old priest was lying still in his coffin as we
had seen him, solemn and truculent in death, an idle chalice on his breast.

 Eliza resumed:

 “Wide-awake and laughing-like to himself.... So then, of course, when
they saw that, that made them think that there was something gone wrong with
him....”
