THE DARLING
    

      BY ANTON P. CHEKOV
    

Olenka, the
      daughter of the retired collegiate assessor Plemyanikov, was sitting on
      the back-door steps of her house doing nothing. It was hot, the flies were
      nagging and teasing, and it was pleasant to think that it would soon be
      evening. Dark rain clouds were gathering from the east, wafting a breath
      of moisture every now and then.
    

      Kukin, who roomed in the wing of the same house, was standing in the yard
      looking up at the sky. He was the manager of the Tivoli, an open-air
      theatre.
    

      “Again,” he said despairingly. “Rain again. Rain, rain,
      rain! Every day rain! As though to spite me. I might as well stick my head
      into a noose and be done with it. It’s ruining me. Heavy losses
      every day!” He wrung his hands, and continued, addressing Olenka:
      “What a life, Olga Semyonovna! It’s enough to make a man weep.
      He works, he does his best, his very best, he tortures himself, he passes
      sleepless nights, he thinks and thinks and thinks how to do everything
      just right. And what’s the result? He gives the public the best
      operetta, the very best pantomime, excellent artists. But do they want it?
      Have they the least appreciation of it? The public is rude. The public is
      a great boor. The public wants a circus, a lot of nonsense, a lot of
      stuff. And there’s the weather. Look! Rain almost every evening. It
      began to rain on the tenth of May, and it’s kept it up through the
      whole of June. It’s simply awful. I can’t get any audiences,
      and don’t I have to pay rent? Don’t I have to pay the actors?”
    

      The next day towards evening the clouds gathered again, and Kukin said
      with an hysterical laugh:
    

      “Oh, I don’t care. Let it do its worst. Let it drown the whole
      theatre, and me, too. All right, no luck for me in this world or the next.
      Let the actors bring suit against me and drag me to court. What’s
      the court? Why not Siberia at hard labour, or even the scaffold? Ha, ha,
      ha!”
    

      It was the same on the third day.
    

      Olenka listened to Kukin seriously, in silence. Sometimes tears would rise
      to her eyes. At last Kukin’s misfortune touched her. She fell in
      love with him. He was short, gaunt, with a yellow face, and curly hair
      combed back from his forehead, and a thin tenor voice. His features
      puckered all up when he spoke. Despair was ever inscribed on his face. And
      yet he awakened in Olenka a sincere, deep feeling.
    

      She was always loving somebody. She couldn’t get on without loving
      somebody. She had loved her sick father, who sat the whole time in his
      armchair in a darkened room, breathing heavily. She had loved her aunt,
      who came from Brianska once or twice a year to visit them. And before
      that, when a pupil at the progymnasium, she had loved her French teacher.
      She was a quiet, kind-hearted, compassionate girl, with a soft gentle way
      about her. And she made a very healthy, wholesome impression. Looking at
      her full, rosy cheeks, at her soft white neck with the black mole, and at
      the good naÃ¯ve smile that always played on her face when something
      pleasant was said, the men would think, “Not so bad,” and
      would smile too; and the lady visitors, in the middle of the conversation,
      would suddenly grasp her hand and exclaim, “You darling!” in a
      burst of delight.
    

      The house, hers by inheritance, in which she had lived from birth, was
      located at the outskirts of the city on the Gypsy Road, not far from the
      Tivoli. From early evening till late at night she could hear the music in
      the theatre and the bursting of the rockets; and it seemed to her that
      Kukin was roaring and battling with his fate and taking his chief enemy,
      the indifferent public, by assault. Her heart melted softly, she felt no
      desire to sleep, and when Kukin returned home towards morning, she tapped
      on her window-pane, and through the curtains he saw her face and one
      shoulder and the kind smile she gave him.
    

      He proposed to her, and they were married. And when he had a good look of
      her neck and her full vigorous shoulders, he clapped his hands and said:
    

      “You darling!”
    

      He was happy. But it rained on their wedding-day, and the expression of
      despair never left his face.
    

      They got along well together. She sat in the cashier’s box, kept the
      theatre in order, wrote down the expenses, and paid out the salaries. Her
      rosy cheeks, her kind naÃ¯ve smile, like a halo around her face, could be
      seen at the cashier’s window, behind the scenes, and in the cafÃ©.
      She began to tell her friends that the theatre was the greatest, the most
      important, the most essential thing in the world, that it was the only
      place to obtain true enjoyment in and become humanised and educated.
    

      “But do you suppose the public appreciates it?” she asked.
      “What the public wants is the circus. Yesterday Vanichka and I gave
      Faust Burlesqued, and almost all the boxes were empty. If we had
      given some silly nonsense, I assure you, the theatre would have been
      overcrowded. To-morrow we’ll put Orpheus in Hades on. Do
      come.”
    

      Whatever Kukin said about the theatre and the actors, she repeated. She
      spoke, as he did, with contempt of the public, of its indifference to art,
      of its boorishness. She meddled in the rehearsals, corrected the actors,
      watched the conduct of the musicians; and when an unfavourable criticism
      appeared in the local paper, she wept and went to the editor to argue with
      him.
    

      The actors were fond of her and called her “Vanichka and I”
      and “the darling.” She was sorry for them and lent them small
      sums. When they bilked her, she never complained to her husband; at the
      utmost she shed a few tears.
    

      In winter, too, they got along nicely together. They leased a theatre in
      the town for the whole winter and sublet it for short periods to a Little
      Russian theatrical company, to a conjuror and to the local amateur
      players.
    

      Olenka grew fuller and was always beaming with contentment; while Kukin
      grew thinner and yellower and complained of his terrible losses, though he
      did fairly well the whole winter. At night he coughed, and she gave him
      raspberry syrup and lime water, rubbed him with eau de Cologne, and
      wrapped him up in soft coverings.
    

      “You are my precious sweet,” she said with perfect sincerity,
      stroking his hair. “You are such a dear.”
    

      At Lent he went to Moscow to get his company together, and, while without
      him, Olenka was unable to sleep. She sat at the window the whole time,
      gazing at the stars. She likened herself to the hens that are also uneasy
      and unable to sleep when their rooster is out of the coop. Kukin was
      detained in Moscow. He wrote he would be back during Easter Week, and in
      his letters discussed arrangements already for the Tivoli. But late one
      night, before Easter Monday, there was an ill-omened knocking at the
      wicket-gate. It was like a knocking on a barrel—boom, boom, boom!
      The sleepy cook ran barefooted, plashing through the puddles, to open the
      gate.
    

      “Open the gate, please,” said some one in a hollow bass voice.
      “I have a telegram for you.”
    

      Olenka had received telegrams from her husband before; but this time,
      somehow, she was numbed with terror. She opened the telegram with
      trembling hands and read:
    

      “Ivan Petrovich died suddenly to-day. Awaiting propt orders for
      wuneral Tuesday.”
    

      That was the way the telegram was written—“wuneral”—and
      another unintelligible word—“propt.” The telegram was
      signed by the manager of the opera company.
    

      “My dearest!” Olenka burst out sobbing. “Vanichka, my
      dearest, my sweetheart. Why did I ever meet you? Why did I ever get to
      know you and love you? To whom have you abandoned your poor Olenka, your
      poor, unhappy Olenka?”
    

      Kukin was buried on Tuesday in the Vagankov Cemetery in Moscow. Olenka
      returned home on Wednesday; and as soon as she entered her house she threw
      herself on her bed and broke into such loud sobbing that she could be
      heard in the street and in the neighbouring yards.
    

      “The darling!” said the neighbours, crossing themselves.
      “How Olga Semyonovna, the poor darling, is grieving!”
    

      Three months afterwards Olenka was returning home from mass, downhearted
      and in deep mourning. Beside her walked a man also returning from church,
      Vasily Pustovalov, the manager of the merchant Babakayev’s
      lumber-yard. He was wearing a straw hat, a white vest with a gold chain,
      and looked more like a landowner than a business man.
    

      “Everything has its ordained course, Olga Semyonovna,” he said
      sedately, with sympathy in his voice. “And if any one near and dear
      to us dies, then it means it was God’s will and we should remember
      that and bear it with submission.”
    

      He took her to the wicket-gate, said good-bye and went away. After that
      she heard his sedate voice the whole day; and on closing her eyes she
      instantly had a vision of his dark beard. She took a great liking to him.
      And evidently he had been impressed by her, too; for, not long after, an
      elderly woman, a distant acquaintance, came in to have a cup of coffee
      with her. As soon as the woman was seated at table she began to speak
      about Pustovalov—how good he was, what a steady man, and any woman
      could be glad to get him as a husband. Three days later Pustovalov himself
      paid Olenka a visit. He stayed only about ten minutes, and spoke little,
      but Olenka fell in love with him, fell in love so desperately that she did
      not sleep the whole night and burned as with fever. In the morning she
      sent for the elderly woman. Soon after, Olenka and Pustovalov were
      engaged, and the wedding followed.
    

      Pustovalov and Olenka lived happily together. He usually stayed in the
      lumber-yard until dinner, then went out on business. In his absence Olenka
      took his place in the office until evening, attending to the book-keeping
      and despatching the orders.
    

      “Lumber rises twenty per cent every year nowadays,” she told
      her customers and acquaintances. “Imagine, we used to buy wood from
      our forests here. Now Vasichka has to go every year to the government of
      Mogilev to get wood. And what a tax!” she exclaimed, covering her
      cheeks with her hands in terror. “What a tax!”
    

      She felt as if she had been dealing in lumber for ever so long, that the
      most important and essential thing in life was lumber. There was something
      touching and endearing in the way she pronounced the words, “beam,”
      “joist,” “plank,” “stave,” “lath,”
      “gun-carriage,” “clamp.” At night she dreamed of
      whole mountains of boards and planks, long, endless rows of wagons
      conveying the wood somewhere, far, far from the city. She dreamed that a
      whole regiment of beams, 36 ft. x 5 in., were advancing in an upright
      position to do battle against the lumber-yard; that the beams and joists
      and clamps were knocking against each other, emitting the sharp crackling
      reports of dry wood, that they were all falling and then rising again,
      piling on top of each other. Olenka cried out in her sleep, and Pustovalov
      said to her gently:
    

      “Olenka my dear, what is the matter? Cross yourself.”
    

      Her husband’s opinions were all hers. If he thought the room was too
      hot, she thought so too. If he thought business was dull, she thought
      business was dull. Pustovalov was not fond of amusements and stayed home
      on holidays; she did the same.
    

      “You are always either at home or in the office,” said her
      friends. “Why don’t you go to the theatre or to the circus,
      darling?”
    

      “Vasichka and I never go to the theatre,” she answered
      sedately. “We have work to do, we have no time for nonsense. What
      does one get out of going to theatre?”
    

      On Saturdays she and Pustovalov went to vespers, and on holidays to early
      mass. On returning home they walked side by side with rapt faces, an
      agreeable smell emanating from both of them and her silk dress rustling
      pleasantly. At home they drank tea with milk-bread and various jams, and
      then ate pie. Every day at noontime there was an appetising odour in the
      yard and outside the gate of cabbage soup, roast mutton, or duck; and, on
      fast days, of fish. You couldn’t pass the gate without being seized
      by an acute desire to eat. The samovar was always boiling on the office
      table, and customers were treated to tea and biscuits. Once a week the
      married couple went to the baths and returned with red faces, walking side
      by side.
    

      “We are getting along very well, thank God,” said Olenka to
      her friends. “God grant that all should live as well as Vasichka and
      I.”
    

      When Pustovalov went to the government of Mogilev to buy wood, she was
      dreadfully homesick for him, did not sleep nights, and cried. Sometimes
      the veterinary surgeon of the regiment, Smirnov, a young man who lodged in
      the wing of her house, came to see her evenings. He related incidents, or
      they played cards together. This distracted her. The most interesting of
      his stories were those of his own life. He was married and had a son; but
      he had separated from his wife because she had deceived him, and now he
      hated her and sent her forty rubles a month for his son’s support.
      Olenka sighed, shook her head, and was sorry for him.
    

      “Well, the Lord keep you,” she said, as she saw him off to the
      door by candlelight. “Thank you for coming to kill time with me. May
      God give you health. Mother in Heaven!” She spoke very sedately,
      very judiciously, imitating her husband. The veterinary surgeon had
      disappeared behind the door when she called out after him: “Do you
      know, Vladimir Platonych, you ought to make up with your wife. Forgive
      her, if only for the sake of your son. The child understands everything,
      you may be sure.”
    

      When Pustovalov returned, she told him in a low voice about the veterinary
      surgeon and his unhappy family life; and they sighed and shook their
      heads, and talked about the boy who must be homesick for his father. Then,
      by a strange association of ideas, they both stopped before the sacred
      images, made genuflections, and prayed to God to send them children.
    

      And so the Pustovalovs lived for full six years, quietly and peaceably, in
      perfect love and harmony. But once in the winter Vasily Andreyich, after
      drinking some hot tea, went out into the lumber-yard without a hat on his
      head, caught a cold and took sick. He was treated by the best physicians,
      but the malady progressed, and he died after an illness of four months.
      Olenka was again left a widow.
    

      “To whom have you left me, my darling?” she wailed after the
      funeral. “How shall I live now without you, wretched creature that I
      am. Pity me, good people, pity me, fatherless and motherless, all alone in
      the world!”
    

      She went about dressed in black and weepers, and she gave up wearing hats
      and gloves for good. She hardly left the house except to go to church and
      to visit her husband’s grave. She almost led the life of a nun.
    

      It was not until six months had passed that she took off the weepers and
      opened her shutters. She began to go out occasionally in the morning to
      market with her cook. But how she lived at home and what went on there,
      could only be surmised. It could be surmised from the fact that she was
      seen in her little garden drinking tea with the veterinarian while he read
      the paper out loud to her, and also from the fact that once on meeting an
      acquaintance at the post-office, she said to her:
    

      “There is no proper veterinary inspection in our town. That is why
      there is so much disease. You constantly hear of people getting sick from
      the milk and becoming infected by the horses and cows. The health of
      domestic animals ought really to be looked after as much as that of human
      beings.”
    

      She repeated the veterinarian’s words and held the same opinions as
      he about everything. It was plain that she could not exist a single year
      without an attachment, and she found her new happiness in the wing of her
      house. In any one else this would have been condemned; but no one could
      think ill of Olenka. Everything in her life was so transparent. She and
      the veterinary surgeon never spoke about the change in their relations.
      They tried, in fact, to conceal it, but unsuccessfully; for Olenka could
      have no secrets. When the surgeon’s colleagues from the regiment
      came to see him, she poured tea, and served the supper, and talked to them
      about the cattle plague, the foot and mouth disease, and the municipal
      slaughter houses. The surgeon was dreadfully embarrassed, and after the
      visitors had left, he caught her hand and hissed angrily:
    

      “Didn’t I ask you not to talk about what you don’t
      understand? When we doctors discuss things, please don’t mix in. It’s
      getting to be a nuisance.”
    

      She looked at him in astonishment and alarm, and asked:
    

      “But, Volodichka, what am I to talk about?”
    

      And she threw her arms round his neck, with tears in her eyes, and begged
      him not to be angry. And they were both happy.
    

      But their happiness was of short duration. The veterinary surgeon went
      away with his regiment to be gone for good, when it was transferred to
      some distant place almost as far as Siberia, and Olenka was left alone.
    

      Now she was completely alone. Her father had long been dead, and his
      armchair lay in the attic covered with dust and minus one leg. She got
      thin and homely, and the people who met her on the street no longer looked
      at her as they had used to, nor smiled at her. Evidently her best years
      were over, past and gone, and a new, dubious life was to begin which it
      were better not to think about.
    

      In the evening Olenka sat on the steps and heard the music playing and the
      rockets bursting in the Tivoli; but it no longer aroused any response in
      her. She looked listlessly into the yard, thought of nothing, wanted
      nothing, and when night came on, she went to bed and dreamed of nothing
      but the empty yard. She ate and drank as though by compulsion.
    

      And what was worst of all, she no longer held any opinions. She saw and
      understood everything that went on around her, but she could not form an
      opinion about it. She knew of nothing to talk about. And how dreadful not
      to have opinions! For instance, you see a bottle, or you see that it is
      raining, or you see a muzhik riding by in a wagon. But what the bottle or
      the rain or the muzhik are for, or what the sense of them all is, you
      cannot tell—you cannot tell, not for a thousand rubles. In the days
      of Kukin and Pustovalov and then of the veterinary surgeon, Olenka had had
      an explanation for everything, and would have given her opinion freely no
      matter about what. But now there was the same emptiness in her heart and
      brain as in her yard. It was as galling and bitter as a taste of wormwood.
    

      Gradually the town grew up all around. The Gypsy Road had become a street,
      and where the Tivoli and the lumber-yard had been, there were now houses
      and a row of side streets. How quickly time flies! Olenka’s house
      turned gloomy, the roof rusty, the shed slanting. Dock and thistles
      overgrew the yard. Olenka herself had aged and grown homely. In the summer
      she sat on the steps, and her soul was empty and dreary and bitter. When
      she caught the breath of spring, or when the wind wafted the chime of the
      cathedral bells, a sudden flood of memories would pour over her, her heart
      would expand with a tender warmth, and the tears would stream down her
      cheeks. But that lasted only a moment. Then would come emptiness again,
      and the feeling, What is the use of living? The black kitten Bryska rubbed
      up against her and purred softly, but the little creature’s caresses
      left Olenka untouched. That was not what she needed. What she needed was a
      love that would absorb her whole being, her reason, her whole soul, that
      would give her ideas, an object in life, that would warm her aging blood.
      And she shook the black kitten off her skirt angrily, saying:
    

      “Go away! What are you doing here?”
    

      And so day after day, year after year not a single joy, not a single
      opinion. Whatever Marva, the cook, said was all right.
    

      One hot day in July, towards evening, as the town cattle were being driven
      by, and the whole yard was filled with clouds of dust, there was suddenly
      a knocking at the gate. Olenka herself went to open it, and was
      dumbfounded to behold the veterinarian Smirnov. He had turned grey and was
      dressed as a civilian. All the old memories flooded into her soul, she
      could not restrain herself, she burst out crying, and laid her head on
      Smirnov’s breast without saying a word. So overcome was she that she
      was totally unconscious of how they walked into the house and seated
      themselves to drink tea.
    

      “My darling!” she murmured, trembling with joy. “Vladimir
      Platonych, from where has God sent you?”
    

      “I want to settle here for good,” he told her. “I have
      resigned my position and have come here to try my fortune as a free man
      and lead a settled life. Besides, it’s time to send my boy to the
      gymnasium. He is grown up now. You know, my wife and I have become
      reconciled.”
    

      “Where is she?” asked Olenka.
    

      “At the hotel with the boy. I am looking for lodgings.”
    

      “Good gracious, bless you, take my house. Why won’t my house
      do? Oh, dear! Why, I won’t ask any rent of you,” Olenka burst
      out in the greatest excitement, and began to cry again. “You live
      here, and the wing will be enough for me. Oh, Heavens, what a joy!”
    

      The very next day the roof was being painted and the walls whitewashed,
      and Olenka, arms akimbo, was going about the yard superintending. Her face
      brightened with her old smile. Her whole being revived and freshened, as
      though she had awakened from a long sleep. The veterinarian’s wife
      and child arrived. She was a thin, plain woman, with a crabbed expression.
      The boy Sasha, small for his ten years of age, was a chubby child, with
      clear blue eyes and dimples in his cheeks. He made for the kitten the
      instant he entered the yard, and the place rang with his happy laughter.
    

      “Is that your cat, auntie?” he asked Olenka. “When she
      has little kitties, please give me one. Mamma is awfully afraid of mice.”
    

      Olenka chatted with him, gave him tea, and there was a sudden warmth in
      her bosom and a soft gripping at her heart, as though the boy were her own
      son.
    

      In the evening, when he sat in the dining-room studying his lessons, she
      looked at him tenderly and whispered to herself:
    

      “My darling, my pretty. You are such a clever child, so good to look
      at.”
    

      “An island is a tract of land entirely surrounded by water,”
      he recited.
    

      “An island is a tract of land,” she repeated—the first
      idea asseverated with conviction after so many years of silence and mental
      emptiness.
    

      She now had her opinions, and at supper discussed with Sasha’s
      parents how difficult the studies had become for the children at the
      gymnasium, but how, after all, a classical education was better than a
      commercial course, because when you graduated from the gymnasium then the
      road was open to you for any career at all. If you chose to, you could
      become a doctor, or, if you wanted to, you could become an engineer.
    

      Sasha began to go to the gymnasium. His mother left on a visit to her
      sister in Kharkov and never came back. The father was away every day
      inspecting cattle, and sometimes was gone three whole days at a time, so
      that Sasha, it seemed to Olenka, was utterly abandoned, was treated as if
      he were quite superfluous, and must be dying of hunger. So she transferred
      him into the wing along with herself and fixed up a little room for him
      there.
    

      Every morning Olenka would come into his room and find him sound asleep
      with his hand tucked under his cheek, so quiet that he seemed not to be
      breathing. What a shame to have to wake him, she thought.
    

      “Sashenka,” she said sorrowingly, “get up, darling. It’s
      time to go to the gymnasium.”
    

      He got up, dressed, said his prayers, then sat down to drink tea. He drank
      three glasses of tea, ate two large cracknels and half a buttered roll.
      The sleep was not yet out of him, so he was a little cross.
    

      “You don’t know your fable as you should, Sashenka,”
      said Olenka, looking at him as though he were departing on a long journey.
      “What a lot of trouble you are. You must try hard and learn, dear,
      and mind your teachers.”
    

      “Oh, let me alone, please,” said Sasha.
    

      Then he went down the street to the gymnasium, a little fellow wearing a
      large cap and carrying a satchel on his back. Olenka followed him
      noiselessly.
    

      “Sashenka,” she called.
    

      He looked round and she shoved a date or a caramel into his hand. When he
      reached the street of the gymnasium, he turned around and said, ashamed of
      being followed by a tall, stout woman:
    

      “You had better go home, aunt. I can go the rest of the way myself.”
    

      She stopped and stared after him until he had disappeared into the school
      entrance.
    

      Oh, how she loved him! Not one of her other ties had been so deep. Never
      before had she given herself so completely, so disinterestedly, so
      cheerfully as now that her maternal instincts were all aroused. For this
      boy, who was not hers, for the dimples in his cheeks and for his big cap,
      she would have given her life, given it with joy and with tears of
      rapture. Why? Ah, indeed, why?
    

      When she had seen Sasha off to the gymnasium, she returned home quietly,
      content, serene, overflowing with love. Her face, which had grown younger
      in the last half year, smiled and beamed. People who met her were pleased
      as they looked at her.
    

      “How are you, Olga Semyonovna, darling? How are you getting on,
      darling?”
    

      “The gymnasium course is very hard nowadays,” she told at the
      market. “It’s no joke. Yesterday the first class had a fable
      to learn by heart, a Latin translation, and a problem. How is a little
      fellow to do all that?”
    

      And she spoke of the teacher and the lessons and the text-books, repeating
      exactly what Sasha said about them.
    

      At three o’clock they had dinner. In the evening they prepared the
      lessons together, and Olenka wept with Sasha over the difficulties. When
      she put him to bed, she lingered a long time making the sign of the cross
      over him and muttering a prayer. And when she lay in bed, she dreamed of
      the far-away, misty future when Sasha would finish his studies and become
      a doctor or an engineer, have a large house of his own, with horses and a
      carriage, marry and have children. She would fall asleep still thinking of
      the same things, and tears would roll down her cheeks from her closed
      eyes. And the black cat would lie at her side purring: “Mrr, mrr,
      mrr.”
    

      Suddenly there was a loud knocking at the gate. Olenka woke up breathless
      with fright, her heart beating violently. Half a minute later there was
      another knock.
    

      “A telegram from Kharkov,” she thought, her whole body in a
      tremble. “His mother wants Sasha to come to her in Kharkov. Oh,
      great God!”
    

      She was in despair. Her head, her feet, her hands turned cold. There was
      no unhappier creature in the world, she felt. But another minute passed,
      she heard voices. It was the veterinarian coming home from the club.
    

      “Thank God,” she thought. The load gradually fell from her
      heart, she was at ease again. And she went back to bed, thinking of Sasha
      who lay fast asleep in the next room and sometimes cried out in his sleep:
    

      “I’ll give it to you! Get away! Quit your scrapping!”
    











      THE BET
    

      BY ANTON P. CHEKHOV
    

      I
    

It was a dark
      autumn night. The old banker was pacing from corner to corner of his
      study, recalling to his mind the party he gave in the autumn fifteen years
      before. There were many clever people at the party and much interesting
      conversation. They talked among other things of capital punishment. The
      guests, among them not a few scholars and journalists, for the most part
      disapproved of capital punishment. They found it obsolete as a means of
      punishment, unfitted to a Christian State and immoral. Some of them
      thought that capital punishment should be replaced universally by
      life-imprisonment.
    

      “I don’t agree with you,” said the host. “I myself
      have experienced neither capital punishment nor life-imprisonment, but if
      one may judge a priori, then in my opinion capital punishment is
      more moral and more humane than imprisonment. Execution kills instantly,
      life-imprisonment kills by degrees. Who is the more humane executioner,
      one who kills you in a few seconds or one who draws the life out of you
      incessantly, for years?”
    

      “They’re both equally immoral,” remarked one of the
      guests, “because their purpose is the same, to take away life. The
      State is not God. It has no right to take away that which it cannot give
      back, if it should so desire.”
    

      Among the company was a lawyer, a young man of about twenty-five. On being
      asked his opinion, he said:
    

      “Capital punishment and life-imprisonment are equally immoral; but
      if I were offered the choice between them, I would certainly choose the
      second. It’s better to live somehow than not to live at all.”
    

      There ensued a lively discussion. The banker who was then younger and more
      nervous suddenly lost his temper, banged his fist on the table, and
      turning to the young lawyer, cried out:
    

      “It’s a lie. I bet you two millions you wouldn’t stick
      in a cell even for five years.”
    

      “If you mean it seriously,” replied the lawyer, “then I
      bet I’ll stay not five but fifteen.”
    

      “Fifteen! Done!” cried the banker. “Gentlemen, I stake
      two millions.”
    

      “Agreed. You stake two millions, I my freedom,” said the
      lawyer.
    

      So this wild, ridiculous bet came to pass. The banker, who at that time
      had too many millions to count, spoiled and capricious, was beside himself
      with rapture. During supper he said to the lawyer jokingly:
    

      “Come to your senses, young roan, before it’s too late. Two
      millions are nothing to me, but you stand to lose three or four of the
      best years of your life. I say three or four, because you’ll never
      stick it out any longer. Don’t forget either, you unhappy man, that
      voluntary is much heavier than enforced imprisonment. The idea that you
      have the right to free yourself at any moment will poison the whole of
      your life in the cell. I pity you.”
    

      And now the banker, pacing from corner to corner, recalled all this and
      asked himself:
    

      “Why did I make this bet? What’s the good? The lawyer loses
      fifteen years of his life and I throw away two millions. Will it convince
      people that capital punishment is worse or better than imprisonment for
      life? No, no! all stuff and rubbish. On my part, it was the caprice of a
      well-fed man; on the lawyer’s pure greed of gold.”
    

      He recollected further what happened after the evening party. It was
      decided that the lawyer must undergo his imprisonment under the strictest
      observation, in a garden wing of the banker’s house. It was agreed
      that during the period he would be deprived of the right to cross the
      threshold, to see living people, to hear human voices, and to receive
      letters and newspapers. He was permitted to have a musical instrument, to
      read books, to write letters, to drink wine and smoke tobacco. By the
      agreement he could communicate, but only in silence, with the outside
      world through a little window specially constructed for this purpose.
      Everything necessary, books, music, wine, he could receive in any quantity
      by sending a note through the window. The agreement provided for all the
      minutest details, which made the confinement strictly solitary, and it
      obliged the lawyer to remain exactly fifteen years from twelve o’clock
      of November 14th, 1870, to twelve o’clock of November 14th, 1885.
      The least attempt on his part to violate the conditions, to escape if only
      for two minutes before the time freed the banker from the obligation to
      pay him the two millions.
    

      During the first year of imprisonment, the lawyer, as far as it was
      possible to judge from his short notes, suffered terribly from loneliness
      and boredom. From his wing day and night came the sound of the piano. He
      rejected wine and tobacco. “Wine,” he wrote, “excites
      desires, and desires are the chief foes of a prisoner; besides, nothing is
      more boring than to drink good wine alone,” and tobacco spoils the
      air in his room. During the first year the lawyer was sent books of a
      light character; novels with a complicated love interest, stories of crime
      and fantasy, comedies, and so on.
    

      In the second year the piano was heard no longer and the lawyer asked only
      for classics. In the fifth year, music was heard again, and the prisoner
      asked for wine. Those who watched him said that during the whole of that
      year he was only eating, drinking, and lying on his bed. He yawned often
      and talked angrily to himself. Books he did not read. Sometimes at nights
      he would sit down to write. He would write for a long time and tear it all
      up in the morning. More than once he was heard to weep.
    

      In the second half of the sixth year, the prisoner began zealously to
      study languages, philosophy, and history. He fell on these subjects so
      hungrily that the banker hardly had time to get books enough for him. In
      the space of four years about six hundred volumes were bought at his
      request. It was while that passion lasted that the banker received the
      following letter from the prisoner: “My dear gaoler, I am writing
      these lines in six languages. Show them to experts. Let them read them. If
      they do not find one single mistake, I beg you to give orders to have a
      gun fired off in the garden. By the noise I shall know that my efforts
      have not been in vain. The geniuses of all ages and countries speak in
      different languages; but in them all burns the same flame. Oh, if you knew
      my heavenly happiness now that I can understand them!” The prisoner’s
      desire was fulfilled. Two shots were fired in the garden by the banker’s
      order.
    

      Later on, after the tenth year, the lawyer sat immovable before his table
      and read only the New Testament. The banker found it strange that a man
      who in four years had mastered six hundred erudite volumes, should have
      spent nearly a year in reading one book, easy to understand and by no
      means thick. The New Testament was then replaced by the history of
      religions and theology.
    

      During the last two years of his confinement the prisoner read an
      extraordinary amount, quite haphazard. Now he would apply himself to the
      natural sciences, then he would read Byron or Shakespeare. Notes used to
      come from him in which he asked to be sent at the same time a book on
      chemistry, a text-book of medicine, a novel, and some treatise on
      philosophy or theology. He read as though he were swimming in the sea
      among broken pieces of wreckage, and in his desire to save his life was
      eagerly grasping one piece after another.
    

      II
    

The banker recalled
      all this, and thought:
    

      “To-morrow at twelve o’clock he receives his freedom. Under
      the agreement, I shall have to pay him two millions. If I pay, it’s
      all over with me. I am ruined for ever ...”
    

      Fifteen years before he had too many millions to count, but now he was
      afraid to ask himself which he had more of, money or debts. Gambling on
      the Stock-Exchange, risky speculation, and the recklessness of which he
      could not rid himself even in old age, had gradually brought his business
      to decay; and the fearless, self-confident, proud man of business had
      become an ordinary banker, trembling at every rise and fall in the market.
    

      “That cursed bet,” murmured the old man clutching his head in
      despair... “Why didn’t the man die? He’s only forty
      years old. He will take away my last farthing, marry, enjoy life, gamble
      on the Exchange, and I will look on like an envious beggar and hear the
      same words from him every day: ‘I’m obliged to you for the
      happiness of my life. Let me help you.’ No, it’s too much! The
      only escape from bankruptcy and disgrace—is that the man should die.”
    

      The clock had just struck three. The banker was listening. In the house
      every one was asleep, and one could hear only the frozen trees whining
      outside the windows. Trying to make no sound, he took out of his safe the
      key of the door which had not been opened for fifteen years, put on his
      overcoat, and went out of the house. The garden was dark and cold. It was
      raining. A damp, penetrating wind howled in the garden and gave the trees
      no rest. Though he strained his eyes, the banker could see neither the
      ground, nor the white statues, nor the garden wing, nor the trees.
      Approaching the garden wing, he called the watchman twice. There was no
      answer. Evidently the watchman had taken shelter from the bad weather and
      was now asleep somewhere in the kitchen or the greenhouse.
    

      “If I have the courage to fulfil my intention,” thought the
      old man, “the suspicion will fall on the watchman first of all.”
    

      In the darkness he groped for the steps and the door and entered the hall
      of the garden-wing, then poked his way into a narrow passage and struck a
      match. Not a soul was there. Some one’s bed, with no bedclothes on
      it, stood there, and an iron stove loomed dark in the corner. The seals on
      the door that led into the prisoner’s room were unbroken.
    

      When the match went out, the old man, trembling from agitation, peeped
      into the little window.
    

      In the prisoner’s room a candle was burning dimly. The prisoner
      himself sat by the table. Only his back, the hair on his head and his
      hands were visible. Open books were strewn about on the table, the two
      chairs, and on the carpet near the table.
    

      Five minutes passed and the prisoner never once stirred. Fifteen years’
      confinement had taught him to sit motionless. The banker tapped on the
      window with his finger, but the prisoner made no movement in reply. Then
      the banker cautiously tore the seals from the door and put the key into
      the lock. The rusty lock gave a hoarse groan and the door creaked. The
      banker expected instantly to hear a cry of surprise and the sound of
      steps. Three minutes passed and it was as quiet inside as it had been
      before. He made up his mind to enter.
    

      Before the table sat a man, unlike an ordinary human being. It was a
      skeleton, with tight-drawn skin, with long curly hair like a woman’s,
      and a shaggy beard. The colour of his face was yellow, of an earthy shade;
      the cheeks were sunken, the back long and narrow, and the hand upon which
      he leaned his hairy head was so lean and skinny that it was painful to
      look upon. His hair was already silvering with grey, and no one who
      glanced at the senile emaciation of the face would have believed that he
      was only forty years old. On the table, before his bended head, lay a
      sheet of paper on which something was written in a tiny hand.
    

      “Poor devil,” thought the banker, “he’s asleep and
      probably seeing millions in his dreams. I have only to take and throw this
      half-dead thing on the bed, smother him a moment with the pillow, and the
      most careful examination will find no trace of unnatural death. But,
      first, let us read what he has written here.”
    

      The banker took the sheet from the table and read:
    

      “To-morrow at twelve o’clock midnight, I shall obtain my
      freedom and the right to mix with people. But before I leave this room and
      see the sun I think it necessary to say a few words to you. On my own
      clear conscience and before God who sees me I declare to you that I
      despise freedom, life, health, and all that your books call the blessings
      of the world.
    

      “For fifteen years I have diligently studied earthly life. True, I
      saw neither the earth nor the people, but in your books I drank fragrant
      wine, sang songs, hunted deer and wild boar in the forests, loved women...
      And beautiful women, like clouds ethereal, created by the magic of your
      poets’ genius, visited me by night and whispered to me wonderful
      tales, which made my head drunken. In your books I climbed the summits of
      Elbruz and Mont Blanc and saw from there how the sun rose in the morning,
      and in the evening suffused the sky, the ocean and the mountain ridges
      with a purple gold. I saw from there how above me lightnings glimmered
      cleaving the clouds; I saw green forests, fields, rivers, lakes, cities; I
      heard syrens singing, and the playing of the pipes of Pan; I touched the
      wings of beautiful devils who came flying to me to speak of God... In your
      books I cast myself into bottomless abysses, worked miracles, burned
      cities to the ground, preached new religions, conquered whole countries...
    

      “Your books gave me wisdom. All that unwearying human thought
      created in the centuries is compressed to a little lump in my skull. I
      know that I am cleverer than you all.
    

      “And I despise your books, despise all worldly blessings and wisdom.
      Everything is void, frail, visionary and delusive as a mirage. Though you
      be proud and wise and beautiful, yet will death wipe you from the face of
      the earth like the mice underground; and your posterity, your history, and
      the immortality of your men of genius will be as frozen slag, burnt down
      together with the terrestrial globe.
    

      “You are mad, and gone the wrong way. You take falsehood for truth
      and ugliness for beauty. You would marvel if suddenly apple and orange
      trees should bear frogs and lizards instead of fruit, and if roses should
      begin to breathe the odour of a sweating horse. So do I marvel at you, who
      have bartered heaven for earth. I do not want to understand you.
    

      “That I may show you in deed my contempt for that by which you live,
      I waive the two millions of which I once dreamed as of paradise, and which
      I now despise. That I may deprive myself of my right to them, I shall come
      out from here five minutes before the stipulated term, and thus shall
      violate the agreement.”
    

      When he had read, the banker put the sheet on the table, kissed the head
      of the strange man, and began to weep. He went out of the wing. Never at
      any other time, not even after his terrible losses on the Exchange, had he
      felt such contempt for himself as now. Coming home, he lay down on his
      bed, but agitation and tears kept him a long time from sleeping...
    

      The next morning the poor watchman came running to him and told him that
      they had seen the man who lived in the wing climb through the window into
      the garden. He had gone to the gate and disappeared. The banker instantly
      went with his servants to the wing and established the escape of his
      prisoner. To avoid unnecessary rumours he took the paper with the
      renunciation from the table and, on his return, locked it in his safe.
    











      VANKA
    

      BY ANTON P. CHEKHOV
    

Nine-year-old Vanka
      Zhukov, who had been apprentice to the shoemaker Aliakhin for three
      months, did not go to bed the night before Christmas. He waited till the
      master and mistress and the assistants had gone out to an early
      church-service, to procure from his employer’s cupboard a small
      phial of ink and a penholder with a rusty nib; then, spreading a crumpled
      sheet of paper in front of him, he began to write.
    

      Before, however, deciding to make the first letter, he looked furtively at
      the door and at the window, glanced several times at the sombre ikon, on
      either side of which stretched shelves full of lasts, and heaved a
      heart-rending sigh. The sheet of paper was spread on a bench, and he
      himself was on his knees in front of it.
    

      “Dear Grandfather Konstantin Makarych,” he wrote, “I am
      writing you a letter. I wish you a Happy Christmas and all God’s
      holy best. I have no mamma or papa, you are all I have.”
    

      Vanka gave a look towards the window in which shone the reflection of his
      candle, and vividly pictured to himself his grandfather, Konstantin
      Makarych, who was night-watchman at Messrs. Zhivarev. He was a small,
      lean, unusually lively and active old man of sixty-five, always smiling
      and blear-eyed. All day he slept in the servants’ kitchen or trifled
      with the cooks. At night, enveloped in an ample sheep-skin coat, he
      strayed round the domain tapping with his cudgel. Behind him, each hanging
      its head, walked the old bitch Kashtanka, and the dog Viun, so named
      because of his black coat and long body and his resemblance to a loach.
      Viun was an unusually civil and friendly dog, looking as kindly at a
      stranger as at his masters, but he was not to be trusted. Beneath his
      deference and humbleness was hid the most inquisitorial maliciousness. No
      one knew better than he how to sneak up and take a bite at a leg, or slip
      into the larder or steal a muzhik’s chicken. More than once they had
      nearly broken his hind-legs, twice he had been hung up, every week he was
      nearly flogged to death, but he always recovered.
    

      At this moment, for certain, Vanka’s grandfather must be standing at
      the gate, bFlinking his eyes at the bright red windows of the village
      church, stamping his feet in their high-felt boots, and jesting with the
      people in the yard; his cudgel will be hanging from his belt, he will be
      hugging himself with cold, giving a little dry, old man’s cough, and
      at times pinching a servant-girl or a cook.
    

      “Won’t we take some snuff?” he asks, holding out his
      snuff-box to the women. The women take a pinch of snuff, and sneeze.
    

      The old man goes into indescribable ecstasies, breaks into loud laughter,
      and cries:
    

      “Off with it, it will freeze to your nose!”
    

      He gives his snuff to the dogs, too. Kashtanka sneezes, twitches her nose,
      and walks away offended. Viun deferentially refuses to sniff and wags his
      tail. It is glorious weather, not a breath of wind, clear, and frosty; it
      is a dark night, but the whole village, its white roofs and streaks of
      smoke from the chimneys, the trees silvered with hoar-frost, and the
      snowdrifts, you can see it all. The sky scintillates with bright twinkling
      stars, and the Milky Way stands out so clearly that it looks as if it had
      been polished and rubbed over with snow for the holidays...
    

      Vanka sighs, dips his pen in the ink, and continues to write:
    

      “Last night I got a thrashing, my master dragged me by my hair into
      the yard, and belaboured me with a shoe-maker’s stirrup, because,
      while I was rocking his brat in its cradle, I unfortunately fell asleep.
      And during the week, my mistress told me to clean a herring, and I began
      by its tail, so she took the herring and stuck its snout into my face. The
      assistants tease me, send me to the tavern for vodka, make me steal the
      master’s cucumbers, and the master beats me with whatever is handy.
      Food there is none; in the morning it’s bread, at dinner gruel, and
      in the evening bread again. As for tea or sour-cabbage soup, the master
      and the mistress themselves guzzle that. They make me sleep in the
      vestibule, and when their brat cries, I don’t sleep at all, but have
      to rock the cradle. Dear Grandpapa, for Heaven’s sake, take me away
      from here, home to our village, I can’t bear this any more... I bow
      to the ground to you, and will pray to God for ever and ever, take me from
      here or I shall die...”
    

      The corners of Vanka’s mouth went down, he rubbed his eyes with his
      dirty fist, and sobbed.
    

      “I’ll grate your tobacco for you,” he continued, “I’ll
      pray to God for you, and if there is anything wrong, then flog me like the
      grey goat. And if you really think I shan’t find work, then I’ll
      ask the manager, for Christ’s sake, to let me clean the boots, or I’ll
      go instead of Fedya as underherdsman. Dear Grandpapa, I can’t bear
      this any more, it’ll kill me... I wanted to run away to our village,
      but I have no boots, and I was afraid of the frost, and when I grow up I’ll
      look after you, no one shall harm you, and when you die I’ll pray
      for the repose of your soul, just like I do for mamma Pelagueya.
    

      “As for Moscow, it is a large town, there are all gentlemen’s
      houses, lots of horses, no sheep, and the dogs are not vicious. The
      children don’t come round at Christmas with a star, no one is
      allowed to sing in the choir, and once I saw in a shop window hooks on a
      line and fishing rods, all for sale, and for every kind of fish, awfully
      convenient. And there was one hook which would catch a sheat-fish weighing
      a pound. And there are shops with guns, like the master’s, and I am
      sure they must cost 100 rubles each. And in the meat-shops there are
      woodcocks, partridges, and hares, but who shot them or where they come
      from, the shopman won’t say.
    

      “Dear Grandpapa, and when the masters give a Christmas tree, take a
      golden walnut and hide it in my green box. Ask the young lady, Olga
      Ignatyevna, for it, say it’s for Vanka.”
    

      Vanka sighed convulsively, and again stared at the window. He remembered
      that his grandfather always went to the forest for the Christmas tree, and
      took his grandson with him. What happy times! The frost crackled, his
      grandfather crackled, and as they both did, Vanka did the same. Then
      before cutting down the Christmas tree his grandfather smoked his pipe,
      took a long pinch of snuff, and made fun of poor frozen little Vanka...
      The young fir trees, wrapt in hoar-frost, stood motionless, waiting for
      which of them would die. Suddenly a hare springing from somewhere would
      dart over the snowdrift... His grandfather could not help shouting:
    

      “Catch it, catch it, catch it! Ah, short-tailed devil!”
    

      When the tree was down, his grandfather dragged it to the master’s
      house, and there they set about decorating it. The young lady, Olga
      Ignatyevna, Vanka’s great friend, busied herself most about it. When
      little Vanka’s mother, Pelagueya, was still alive, and was
      servant-woman in the house, Olga Ignatyevna used to stuff him with
      sugar-candy, and, having nothing to do, taught him to read, write, count
      up to one hundred, and even to dance the quadrille. When Pelagueya died,
      they placed the orphan Vanka in the kitchen with his grandfather, and from
      the kitchen he was sent to Moscow to Aliakhin, the shoemaker.
    

      “Come quick, dear Grandpapa,” continued Vanka, “I
      beseech you for Christ’s sake take me from here. Have pity on a poor
      orphan, for here they beat me, and I am frightfully hungry, and so sad
      that I can’t tell you, I cry all the time. The other day the master
      hit me on the head with a last; I fell to the ground, and only just
      returned to life. My life is a misfortune, worse than any dog’s... I
      send greetings to Aliona, to one-eyed Tegor, and the coachman, and don’t
      let any one have my mouth-organ. I remain, your grandson, Ivan Zhukov,
      dear Grandpapa, do come.”
    

      Vanka folded his sheet of paper in four, and put it into an envelope
      purchased the night before for a kopek. He thought a little, dipped the
      pen into the ink, and wrote the address:
    

      “The village, to my grandfather.” He then scratched his head,
      thought again, and added: “Konstantin Makarych.” Pleased at
      not having been interfered with in his writing, he put on his cap, and,
      without putting on his sheep-skin coat, ran out in his shirt-sleeves into
      the street.
    

      The shopman at the poulterer’s, from whom he had inquired the night
      before, had told him that letters were to be put into post-boxes, and from
      there they were conveyed over the whole earth in mail troikas by drunken
      post-boys and to the sound of bells. Vanka ran to the first post-box and
      slipped his precious letter into the slit.
    

      An hour afterwards, lulled by hope, he was sleeping soundly. In his dreams
      he saw a stove, by the stove his grandfather sitting with his legs
      dangling down, barefooted, and reading a letter to the cooks, and Viun
      walking round the stove wagging his tail.
