A TELEPHONIC CONVERSATION

 Consider that a conversation by telephone—when you are simply
      sitting by and not taking any part in that conversation—is one of
      the solemnest curiosities of modern life. Yesterday I was writing a deep
      article on a sublime philosophical subject while such a conversation was
      going on in the room. I notice that one can always write best when
      somebody is talking through a telephone close by. Well, the thing began in
      this way. A member of our household came in and asked me to have our house
      put into communication with Mr. Bagley's downtown. I have observed, in
      many cities, that the sex always shrink from calling up the central office
      themselves. I don't know why, but they do. So I touched the bell, and this
      talk ensued:

  Central Office. (Gruffly.) Hello!

 I. Is it the Central Office?

 C. O. Of course it is. What do you want?

 I. Will you switch me on to the Bagleys, please?

 C. O. All right. Just keep your ear to the telephone.

 Then I heard k-look, k-look, k'look—klook-klook-klook-look-look! then a horrible “gritting” of teeth, and finally a piping female voice:
      Y-e-s? ( Rising inflection. ) Did you wish to speak to me?

 Without answering, I handed the telephone to the applicant, and sat down.
      Then followed that queerest of all the queer things in this world—a
      conversation with only one end to it. You hear questions asked; you don't
      hear the answer. You hear invitations given; you hear no thanks in return.
      You have listening pauses of dead silence, followed by apparently
      irrelevant and unjustifiable exclamations of glad surprise or sorrow or
      dismay. You can't make head or tail of the talk, because you never hear
      anything that the person at the other end of the wire says. Well, I heard
      the following remarkable series of observations, all from the one tongue,
      and all shouted—for you can't ever persuade the sex to speak gently
      into a telephone:

 Yes? Why, how did that happen?

 Pause.

 What did you say?

 Pause.

 Oh no, I don't think it was.

 Pause.

  No ! Oh no, I didn't mean that . I meant, put it in while it
      is still boiling—or just before it comes to a boil.

 Pause.

  What ?

 Pause.

 I turned it over with a backstitch on the selvage edge.

 Pause.

 Yes, I like that way, too; but I think it's better to baste it on with
      Valenciennes or bombazine, or something of that sort. It gives it such an
      air—and attracts so much noise.

 Pause.

 It's forty-ninth Deuteronomy, sixty-forth to ninety-seventh inclusive. I
      think we ought all to read it often.

 Pause.

 Perhaps so; I generally use a hair pin.

 Pause.

 What did you say? (_Aside_.) Children, do be quiet!

 Pause

  Oh! B flat! Dear me, I thought you said it was the cat!

 Pause.

 Since when ?

 Pause.

 Why, I never heard of it.

 Pause.

 You astound me! It seems utterly impossible!

 Pause.

  Who did?

 Pause.

 Good-ness gracious!

 Pause.

 Well, what is this world coming to? Was it right in church ?

 Pause.

 And was her mother there?

 Pause.

 Why, Mrs. Bagley, I should have died of humiliation! What did they do ?

 Long pause.

 I can't be perfectly sure, because I haven't the notes by me; but I think
      it goes something like this: te-rolly-loll-loll, loll lolly-loll-loll, O
      tolly-loll-loll- lee-ly-li -i-do! And then repeat , you know.

 Pause.

 Yes, I think it is very sweet—and very solemn and impressive,
      if you get the andantino and the pianissimo right.

 Pause.

 Oh, gum-drops, gum-drops! But I never allow them to eat striped candy. And
      of course they can't , till they get their teeth, anyway.

 Pause.

  What ?

 Pause.

 Oh, not in the least—go right on. He's here writing—it doesn't
      bother him .

 Pause.

 Very well, I'll come if I can. ( Aside .) Dear me, how it does tire a
      person's arm to hold this thing up so long! I wish she'd—

 Pause.

 Oh no, not at all; I like to talk—but I'm afraid I'm keeping
      you from your affairs.

 Pause.

 Visitors?

 Pause.

 No, we never use butter on them.

 Pause.

 Yes, that is a very good way; but all the cook-books say they are very
      unhealthy when they are out of season. And he doesn't like them,
      anyway—especially canned.

 Pause.

 Oh, I think that is too high for them; we have never paid over fifty cents
      a bunch.

 Pause.

  Must you go? Well, good -by.

 Pause.

 Yes, I think so. good -by.

 Pause.

 Four o'clock, then—I'll be ready. good -by.

 Pause.

 Thank you ever so much. good -by.

 Pause.

 Oh, not at all!—just as fresh— which ? Oh, I'm glad to
      hear you say that. Good -by.

 (Hangs up the telephone and says, “Oh, it does tire a person's arm
      so!”)

 A man delivers a single brutal “Good-by,” and that is the end of it. Not
      so with the gentle sex—I say it in their praise; they cannot abide
      abruptness.
