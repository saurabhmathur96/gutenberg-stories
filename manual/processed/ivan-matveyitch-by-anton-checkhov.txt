IVAN MATVEYITCH
    

      BETWEEN five and six in the evening. A fairly well-known man of
      learning-we will call him simply the man of learning-is sitting in his
      study nervously biting his nails.
    

      "It's positively revolting," he says, continually looking at his watch.
      "It shows the utmost disrespect for another man's time and work. In
      England such a person would not earn a farthing, he would die of hunger.
      You wait a minute, when you do come . . . ."
    

      And feeling a craving to vent his wrath and impatience upon someone, the
      man of learning goes to the door leading to his wife's room and knocks.
    

      "Listen, Katya," he says in an indignant voice. "If you see Pyotr
      Danilitch, tell him that decent people don't do such things. It's
      abominable! He recommends a secretary, and does not know the sort of man
      he is recommending! The wretched boy is two or three hours late with
      unfailing regularity every day. Do you call that a secretary? Those two or
      three hours are more precious to me than two or three years to other
      people. When he does come I will swear at him like a dog, and won't pay
      him and will kick him out. It's no use standing on ceremony with people
      like that!"
    

      "You say that every day, and yet he goes on coming and coming."
    

      "But to-day I have made up my mind. I have lost enough through him. You
      must excuse me, but I shall swear at him like a cabman."
    

      At last a ring is heard. The man of learning makes a grave face; drawing
      himself up, and, throwing back his head, he goes into the entry. There his
      amanuensis Ivan Matveyitch, a young man of eighteen, with a face oval as
      an egg and no moustache, wearing a shabby, mangy overcoat and no goloshes,
      is already standing by the hatstand. He is in breathless haste, and
      scrupulously wipes his huge clumsy boots on the doormat, trying as he does
      so to conceal from the maidservant a hole in his boot through which a
      white sock is peeping. Seeing the man of learning he smiles with that
      broad, prolonged, somewhat foolish smile which is seen only on the faces
      of children or very good-natured people.
    

      "Ah, good evening!" he says, holding out a big wet hand. "Has your sore
      throat gone?"
    

      "Ivan Matveyitch," says the man of learning in a shaking voice, stepping
      back and clasping his hands together. "Ivan Matveyitch."
    

      Then he dashes up to the amanuensis, clutches him by the shoulders, and
      begins feebly shaking him.
    

      "What a way to treat me!" he says with despair in his voice. "You
      dreadful, horrid fellow, what a way to treat me! Are you laughing at me,
      are you jeering at me? Eh?"
    

      Judging from the smile which still lingered on his face Ivan Matveyitch
      had expected a very different reception, and so, seeing the man of
      learning's countenance eloquent of indignation, his oval face grows longer
      than ever, and he opens his mouth in amazement.
    

      "What is . . . what is it?" he asks.
    

      "And you ask that?" the man of learning clasps his hands. "You know how
      precious time is to me, and you are so late. You are two hours late! . . .
      Have you no fear of God?"
    

      "I haven't come straight from home," mutters Ivan Matveyitch, untying his
      scarf irresolutely. "I have been at my aunt's name-day party, and my aunt
      lives five miles away. . . . If I had come straight from home, then it
      would have been a different thing."
    

      "Come, reflect, Ivan Matveyitch, is there any logic in your conduct? Here
      you have work to do, work at a fixed time, and you go flying off after
      name-day parties and aunts! But do make haste and undo your wretched
      scarf! It's beyond endurance, really!"
    

      The man of learning dashes up to the amanuensis again and helps him to
      disentangle his scarf.
    

      "You are done up like a peasant woman, . . . Come along, . . . Please make
      haste!"
    

      Blowing his nose in a dirty, crumpled-up handkerchief and pulling down his
      grey reefer jacket, Ivan Matveyitch goes through the hall and the
      drawing-room to the study. There a place and paper and even cigarettes had
      been put ready for him long ago.
    

      "Sit down, sit down," the man of learning urges him on, rubbing his hands
      impatiently. "You are an unsufferable person. . . . You know the work has
      to be finished by a certain time, and then you are so late. One is forced
      to scold you. Come, write, . . . Where did we stop?"
    

      Ivan Matveyitch smooths his bristling cropped hair and takes up his pen.
      The man of learning walks up and down the room, concentrates himself, and
      begins to dictate:
    

      "The fact is . . . comma . . . that so to speak fundamental forms . . .
      have you written it? . . . forms are conditioned entirely by the essential
      nature of those principles . . . comma . . . which find in them their
      expression and can only be embodied in them . . . . New line, . . .
      There's a stop there, of course. . . . More independence is found . . . is
      found . . . by the forms which have not so much a political . . . comma .
      . . as a social character . ."
    

      "The high-school boys have a different uniform now . . . a grey one," said
      Ivan Matveyitch, "when I was at school it was better: they used to wear
      regular uniforms."
    

      "Oh dear, write please!" says the man of learning wrathfully. "Character .
      . . have you written it? Speaking of the forms relating to the
      organization . . . of administrative functions, and not to the regulation
      of the life of the people . . . comma . . . it cannot be said that they
      are marked by the nationalism of their forms . . . the last three words in
      inverted commas. . . . Aie, aie . . . tut, tut . . . so what did you want
      to say about the high school?"
    

      "That they used to wear a different uniform in my time."
    

      "Aha! . . . indeed, . . . Is it long since you left the high school?"
    

      "But I told you that yesterday. It is three years since I left school. . .
      . I left in the fourth class."
    

      "And why did you give up high school?" asks the man of learning, looking
      at Ivan Matveyitch's writing.
    

      "Oh, through family circumstances."
    

      "Must I speak to you again, Ivan Matveyitch? When will you get over your
      habit of dragging out the lines? There ought not to be less than forty
      letters in a line."
    

      "What, do you suppose I do it on purpose?" says Ivan Matveyitch, offended.
      "There are more than forty letters in some of the other lines. . . . You
      count them. And if you think I don't put enough in the line, you can take
      something off my pay."
    

      "Oh dear, that's not the point. You have no delicacy, really. . . . At the
      least thing you drag in money. The great thing is to be exact, Ivan
      Matveyitch, to be exact is the great thing. You ought to train yourself to
      be exact."
    

      The maidservant brings in a tray with two glasses of tea on it, and a
      basket of rusks. . . . Ivan Matveyitch takes his glass awkwardly with both
      hands, and at once begins drinking it. The tea is too hot. To avoid
      burning his mouth Ivan Matveyitch tries to take a tiny sip. He eats one
      rusk, then a second, then a third, and, looking sideways, with
      embarrassment, at the man of learning, timidly stretches after a fourth. .
      . . The noise he makes in swallowing, the relish with which he smacks his
      lips, and the expression of hungry greed in his raised eyebrows irritate
      the man of learning.
    

      "Make haste and finish, time is precious."
    

      "You dictate, I can drink and write at the same time. . . . I must confess
      I was hungry."
    

      "I should think so after your walk!"
    

      "Yes, and what wretched weather! In our parts there is a scent of spring
      by now. . . . There are puddles everywhere; the snow is melting."
    

      "You are a southerner, I suppose?"
    

      "From the Don region. . . . It's quite spring with us by March. Here it is
      frosty, everyone's in a fur coat, . . . but there you can see the grass .
      . . it's dry everywhere, and one can even catch tarantulas."
    

      "And what do you catch tarantulas for?"
    

      "Oh! . . . to pass the time . . ." says Ivan Matveyitch, and he sighs.
      "It's fun catching them. You fix a bit of pitch on a thread, let it down
      into their hole and begin hitting the tarantula on the back with the
      pitch, and the brute gets cross, catches hold of the pitch with his claws,
      and gets stuck. . . . And what we used to do with them! We used to put a
      basinful of them together and drop a bihorka in with them."
    

      "What is a bihorka?"
    

      "That's another spider, very much the same as a tarantula. In a fight one
      of them can kill a hundred tarantulas."
    

      "H'm! . . . But we must write, . . . Where did we stop?"
    

      The man of learning dictates another twenty lines, then sits plunged in
      meditation.
    

      Ivan Matveyitch, waiting while the other cogitates, sits and, craning his
      neck, puts the collar of his shirt to rights. His tie will not set
      properly, the stud has come out, and the collar keeps coming apart.
    

      "H'm! . . ." says the man of learning. "Well, haven't you found a job yet,
      Ivan Matveyitch?"
    

      "No. And how is one to find one? I am thinking, you know, of volunteering
      for the army. But my father advises my going into a chemist's."
    

      "H'm! . . . But it would be better for you to go into the university. The
      examination is difficult, but with patience and hard work you could get
      through. Study, read more. . . . Do you read much?"
    

      "Not much, I must own . . ." says Ivan Matveyitch, lighting a cigarette.
    

      "Have you read Turgenev?"
    

      "N-no. . . ."
    

      "And Gogol?"
    

      "Gogol. H'm! . . . Gogol. . . . No, I haven't read him!"
    

      "Ivan Matveyitch! Aren't you ashamed? Aie! aie! You are such a nice
      fellow, so much that is original in you . . . you haven't even read Gogol!
      You must read him! I will give you his works! It's essential to read him!
      We shall quarrel if you don't!"
    

      Again a silence follows. The man of learning meditates, half reclining on
      a soft lounge, and Ivan Matveyitch, leaving his collar in peace,
      concentrates his whole attention on his boots. He has not till then
      noticed that two big puddles have been made by the snow melting off his
      boots on the floor. He is ashamed.
    

      "I can't get on to-day . . ." mutters the man of learning. "I suppose you
      are fond of catching birds, too, Ivan Matveyitch?"
    

      "That's in autumn, . . . I don't catch them here, but there at home I
      always did."
    

      "To be sure . . . very good. But we must write, though."
    

      The man of learning gets up resolutely and begins dictating, but after ten
      lines sits down on the lounge again.
    

      "No. . . . Perhaps we had better put it off till to-morrow morning," he
      says. "Come to-morrow morning, only come early, at nine o'clock. God
      preserve you from being late!"
    

      Ivan Matveyitch lays down his pen, gets up from the table and sits in
      another chair. Five minutes pass in silence, and he begins to feel it is
      time for him to go, that he is in the way; but in the man of learning's
      study it is so snug and light and warm, and the impression of the nice
      rusks and sweet tea is still so fresh that there is a pang at his heart at
      the mere thought of home. At home there is poverty, hunger, cold, his
      grumbling father, scoldings, and here it is so quiet and unruffled, and
      interest even is taken in his tarantulas and birds.
    

      The man of learning looks at his watch and takes up a book.
    

      "So you will give me Gogol?' says Ivan Matveyitch, getting up.
    

      "Yes, yes! But why are you in such a hurry, my dear boy? Sit down and tell
      me something . . ."
    

      Ivan Matveyitch sits down and smiles broadly. Almost every evening he sits
      in this study and always feels something extraordinarily soft, attracting
      him, as it were akin, in the voice and the glance of the man of learning.
      There are moments when he even fancies that the man of learning is
      becoming attached to him, used to him, and that if he scolds him for being
      late, it's simply because he misses his chatter about tarantulas and how
      they catch goldfinches on the Don.
