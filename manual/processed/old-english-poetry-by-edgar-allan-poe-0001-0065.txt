OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*)
    

      IT should not be doubted that at least one-third of the affection with
      which we regard the elder poets of Great Britain should be-attributed to
      what is, in itself, a thing apart from poetry-we mean to the simple love
      of the antique-and that, again, a third of even the proper poetic
      sentiment inspiredby their writings should be ascribed to a fact
      which, while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract, and
      with the old British poems themselves, should not be looked upon as a
      merit appertaining to the authors of the poems. Almost every devout
      admirer of the old bards, if demanded his opinion of their productions,
      would mention vaguely, yet with perfect sincerity, a sense of dreamy,
      wild, indefinite, and he would perhaps say, indefinable delight; on being
      required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure, he would be
      apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general handling. This
      quaintness is, in fact, a very powerful adjunct to ideality, but in the
      case in question it arises independently of the author’s will, and
      is altogether apart from his intention. Words and their rhythm have
      varied. Verses which affect us to-day with a vivid delight, and which
      delight, in many instances, may be traced to the one source, quaintness,
      must have worn in the days of their construction, a very commonplace air.
      This is, of course, no argument against the poems now-we mean it only as
      against the poets thew.There is a growing desire to overrate them.
      The old English muse was frank, guileless, sincere, and although very
      learned, still learned without art. No general error evinces a more
      thorough confusion of ideas than the error of supposing Donne and Cowley
      metaphysical in the sense wherein Wordsworth and Coleridge are so. With
      the two former ethics were the end-with the two latter the means. The poet
      of the “Creation” wished, by highly artificial verse, to
      inculcate what he supposed to be moral truth-the poet of the “Ancient
      Mariner” to infuse the Poetic Sentiment through channels suggested
      by analysis. The one finished by complete failure what he commenced in the
      grossest misconception; the other, by a path which could not possibly lead
      him astray, arrived at a triumph which is not the less glorious because
      hidden from the profane eyes of the multitude. But in this view even the
      “metaphysical verse” of Cowley is but evidence of the
      simplicity and single-heartedness of the man. And he was in this but a
      type of his school-for we may as well designate in this way the entire
      class of writers whose poems are bound up in the volume before us, and
      throughout all of whom there runs a very perceptible general character.
      They used little art in composition. Their writings sprang immediately
      from the soul-and partook intensely of that soul’s nature. Nor is it
      difficult to perceive the tendency of this abandon-to elevateimmeasurably
      all the energies of mind-but, again, so to mingle the greatest possible
      fire, force, delicacy, and all good things, with the lowest possible
      bathos, baldness, and imbecility, as to render it not a matter of doubt
      that the average results of mind in such a school will be found inferior
      to those results in one (ceterisparibus) more artificial.
    

      We can not bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the “Book
      of Gems” are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest
      possible idea of the beauty of the school-but if the intention had been
      merely to show the school’s character, the attempt might have been
      considered successful in the highest degree. There are long passages now
      before us of the most despicable trash, with no merit whatever beyond that
      of their antiquity.. The criticisms of the editor do not particularly
      please us. His enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false.
      His opinion, for example, of Sir Henry Wotton’s “Verses on the
      Queen of Bohemia"-that “there are few finer things in our language,”
      is untenable and absurd.
    

      In such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of Poesy
      which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time. Here
      every thing is art, nakedly, or but awkwardly concealed. No prepossession
      for the mere antique (and in this case we can imagine no other
      prepossession) should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of poetry,
      a series, such as this, of elaborate and threadbare compliments, stitched,
      apparently, together, without fancy, without plausibility, and without
      even an attempt at adaptation.
    

      In common with all the world, we have been much delighted with “The
      Shepherd’s Hunting” by Withers—a poem partaking, in a
      remarkable degree, of the peculiarities of “Il Penseroso.”
      Speaking of Poesy the author says:
    

     “By the murmur of a spring,
     Or the least boughs rustleling,
     By a daisy whose leaves spread,
     Shut when Titan goes to bed,
     Or a shady bush or tree,
     She could more infuse in me
     Than all Nature’s beauties can
     In some other wiser man.
     By her help I also now
     Make this churlish place allow
     Something that may sweeten gladness
     In the very gall of sadness—
     The dull loneness, the black shade,
     That these hanging vaults have made
     The strange music of the waves
     Beating on these hollow caves,
     This black den which rocks emboss,
     Overgrown with eldest moss,
     The rude portals that give light
     More to terror than delight,
     This my chamber of neglect

     Walled about with disrespect;
     From all these and this dull air
     A fit object for despair,
     She hath taught me by her might
     To draw comfort and delight.”
 

      But these lines, however good, do not bear with them much of the general
      character of the English antique. Something more of this will be found in
      Corbet’s “Farewell to the Fairies!” We copy a portion of
      Marvell’s “Maiden lamenting for her Fawn,” which we
      prefer-not only as a specimen of the elder poets, but in itself as a
      beautiful poem, abounding in pathos, exquisitely delicate imagination and
      truthfulness-to anything of its species:
    

     “It is a wondrous thing how fleet
     ‘Twas on those little silver feet,
     With what a pretty skipping grace
     It oft would challenge me the race,
     And when’t had left me far away
     ‘Twould stay, and run again, and stay;
     For it was nimbler much than hinds,
     And trod as if on the four winds.
     I have a garden of my own,
     But so with roses overgrown,
     And lilies, that you would it guess
     To be a little wilderness;
     And all the spring-time of the year
     It only loved to be there.
     Among the beds of lilies I
     Have sought it oft where it should lie,
     Yet could not, till itself would rise,
     Find it, although before mine eyes.
     For in the flaxen lilies’ shade
     It like a bank of lilies laid;
     Upon the roses it would feed
     Until its lips even seemed to bleed,
     And then to me ‘twould boldly trip,
     And print those roses on my lip,
     But all its chief delight was still
     With roses thus itself to fill,
     And its pure virgin limbs to fold
     In whitest sheets of lilies cold.
     Had it lived long, it would have been
     Lilies without, roses within.”
 

      How truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable! It
      pervades all.. It comes over the sweet melody of the words-over the
      gentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herself-even over
      the half-playful, half-petulant air with which she lingers on the beauties
      and good qualities of her favorite-like the cool shadow of a summer cloud
      over a bed of lilies and violets, “and all sweet flowers.” The
      whole is redolent with poetry of a very lofty order. Every line is an idea
      conveying either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn, or the
      artlessness of the maiden, or her love, or her admiration, or her grief,
      or the fragrance and warmth and appropriatenessof the little
      nest-like bed of lilies and roses which the fawn devoured as it lay upon
      them, and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy
      little damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and rosy smile on her
      face. Consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in the
      few lines we have quoted the wonderof the little maiden at the
      fleetness of her favorite-the “little silver feet”—the
      fawn challenging his mistress to a race with “a pretty skipping
      grace,” running on before, and then, with head turned back, awaiting
      her approach only to fly from it again-can we not distinctly perceive all
      these things? How exceedingly vigorous, too, is the line,
    

      “And trod as if on the four winds!”
    

      A vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the
      speaker and the four feet of the favorite, one for each wind. Then
      consider the garden of “my own,” so overgrown, entangled with
      roses and lilies, as to be “a little wilderness”—the
      fawn loving to be there, and there “only”—the maiden
      seeking it “where it shouldlie”—and not being
      able to distinguish it from the flowers until “itself would rise”—the
      lying among the lilies “like a bank of lilies”—the
      loving to “fill itself with roses,”
    

        “And its pure virgin limbs to fold
        In whitest sheets of lilies cold,”
 

      and these things being its “chief” delights-and then the
      pre-eminent beauty and naturalness of the concluding lines, whose very
      hyperbole only renders them more true to nature when we consider the
      innocence, the artlessness, the enthusiasm, the passionate girl, and more
      passionate admiration of the bereaved child—
    

      “Had it lived long, it would have been Lilies without, roses within.”

      PREFACE
    

      THESE trifles are collected and republished chiefly with a view to their
      redemption from the many improvements to which they have been subjected
      while going at random the “rounds of the press.” I am
      naturally anxious that what I have written should circulate as I wrote it,
      if it circulate at all. In defence of my own taste, nevertheless, it is
      incumbent upon me to say that I think nothing in this volume of much value
      to the public, or very creditable to myself. Events not to be controlled
      have prevented me from making, at any time, any serious effort in what,
      under happier circumstances, would have been the field of my choice. With
      me poetry has been not a purpose, but a passion; and the passions should
      be held in reverence: they must not-they can not at will be excited, with
      an eye to the paltry compensations, or the more paltry commendations, of
      man-kind.
