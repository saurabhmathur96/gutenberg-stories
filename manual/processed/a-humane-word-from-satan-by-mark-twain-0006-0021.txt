A HUMANE WORD FROM SATAN

  (The following letter, signed by Satan and purporting to come from him,
        we have reason to believe was not written by him, but by Mark Twain.—Editor.)

 TO THE EDITOR OF HARPER'S WEEKLY:

 Dear Sir and Kinsman,—Let us have done with this frivolous talk.
        The American Board accepts contributions from me every year: then why
        shouldn't it from Mr. Rockefeller? In all the ages, three-fourths of the
        support of the great charities has been conscience-money, as my books
        will show: then what becomes of the sting when that term is applied to
        Mr. Rockefeller's gift? The American Board's trade is financed mainly
        from the graveyards. Bequests, you understand. Conscience-money.
        Confession of an old crime and deliberate perpetration of a new one; for
        deceased's contribution is a robbery of his heirs. Shall the Board
        decline bequests because they stand for one of these offenses every time
        and generally for both?

 Allow me to continue. The charge most persistently and resentfully and
        remorselessly dwelt upon is that Mr. Rockefeller's contribution is
        incurably tainted by perjury—perjury proved against him in the
        courts. It makes us smile —down in my place! Because there
        isn't a rich man in your vast city who doesn't perjure himself every
        year before the tax board. They are all caked with perjury, many layers
        thick. Iron-clad, so to speak. If there is one that isn't, I desire to
        acquire him for my museum, and will pay Dinosaur rates. Will you say it
        isn't infraction of the law, but only annual evasion of it? Comfort
        yourselves with that nice distinction if you like— for the
        present . But by and by, when you arrive, I will show you something
        interesting: a whole hell-full of evaders! Sometimes a frank law-breaker
        turns up elsewhere, but I get those others every time.

 To return to my muttons. I wish you to remember that my rich perjurers
        are contributing to the American Board with frequency: it is money
        filched from the sworn-off personal tax; therefore it is the wages of
        sin; therefore it is my money; therefore it is I that contribute
        it; and, finally, it is therefore as I have said: since the Board daily
        accepts contributions from me, why should it decline them from Mr.
        Rockefeller, who is as good as I am, let the courts say what they may?

 SATAN.



  

  









 INTRODUCTION TO “THE NEW GUIDE OF THE CONVERSATION IN PORTUGUESE AND
      ENGLISH”

 by Pedro Carolino

 In this world of uncertainties, there is, at any rate, one thing which may
      be pretty confidently set down as a certainty: and that is, that this
      celebrated little phrase-book will never die while the English language
      lasts. Its delicious unconscious ridiculousness, and its enchanting
      naivete, are as supreme and unapproachable, in their way, as are
      Shakespeare's sublimities. Whatsoever is perfect in its kind, in
      literature, is imperishable: nobody can imitate it successfully, nobody
      can hope to produce its fellow; it is perfect, it must and will stand
      alone: its immortality is secure.

 It is one of the smallest books in the world, but few big books have
      received such wide attention, and been so much pondered by the grave and
      learned, and so much discussed and written about by the thoughtful, the
      thoughtless, the wise, and the foolish. Long notices of it have appeared,
      from time to time, in the great English reviews, and in erudite and
      authoritative philological periodicals; and it has been laughed at, danced
      upon, and tossed in a blanket by nearly every newspaper and magazine in
      the English-speaking world. Every scribbler, almost, has had his little
      fling at it, at one time or another; I had mine fifteen years ago. The
      book gets out of print, every now and then, and one ceases to hear of it
      for a season; but presently the nations and near and far colonies of our
      tongue and lineage call for it once more, and once more it issues from
      some London or Continental or American press, and runs a new course around
      the globe, wafted on its way by the wind of a world's laughter.

 Many persons have believed that this book's miraculous stupidities were
      studied and disingenuous; but no one can read the volume carefully through
      and keep that opinion. It was written in serious good faith and deep
      earnestness, by an honest and upright idiot who believed he knew something
      of the English language, and could impart his knowledge to others. The
      amplest proof of this crops out somewhere or other upon each and every
      page. There are sentences in the book which could have been manufactured
      by a man in his right mind, and with an intelligent and deliberate
      purposes to seem innocently ignorant; but there are other sentences, and
      paragraphs, which no mere pretended ignorance could ever achieve—nor
      yet even the most genuine and comprehensive ignorance, when unbacked by
      inspiration.

 It is not a fraud who speaks in the following paragraph of the author's
      Preface, but a good man, an honest man, a man whose conscience is at rest,
      a man who believes he has done a high and worthy work for his nation and
      his generation, and is well pleased with his performance:

  We expect then, who the little book (for the care what we wrote him, and
        for her typographical correction) that may be worth the acceptation of
        the studious persons, and especially of the Youth, at which we dedicate
        him particularly.

 One cannot open this book anywhere and not find richness. To prove that
        this is true, I will open it at random and copy the page I happen to
        stumble upon. Here is the result:

 DIALOGUE 16

 FOR TO SEE THE TOWN

 Anothony, go to accompany they gentilsmen, do they see the town.

 We won't to see all that is it remarquable here.

 Come with me, if you please. I shall not folget nothing what can to
        merit your attention. Here we are near to cathedral; will you come in
        there?

 We will first to see him in oudside, after we shall go in there for to
        look the interior.

 Admire this master piece gothic architecture's.

 The chasing of all they figures is astonishing' indeed.

 The cupola and the nave are not less curious to see.

 What is this palace how I see yonder?

 It is the town hall.

 And this tower here at this side?

 It is the Observatory.

 The bridge is very fine, it have ten arches, and is constructed of free
        stone.

 The streets are very layed out by line and too paved.

 What is the circuit of this town?

 Two leagues.

 There is it also hospitals here?

 It not fail them.

 What are then the edifices the worthest to have seen?

 It is the arsnehal, the spectacle's hall, the Cusiomhouse, and the
        Purse.

 We are going too see the others monuments such that the public
        pawnbroker's office, the plants garden's, the money office's, the
        library.

 That it shall be for another day; we are tired.

 DIALOGUE 17

 TO INFORM ONE'SELF OF A PERSON

 How is that gentilman who you did speak by and by?

 Is a German.

 I did think him Englishman.

 He is of the Saxony side.

 He speak the french very well.

 Tough he is German, he speak so much well italyan, french, spanish and
        english, that among the Italyans, they believe him Italyan, he speak the
        frenche as the Frenches himselves. The Spanishesmen believe him
        Spanishing, and the Englishes, Englishman. It is difficult to enjoy well
        so much several languages.

 The last remark contains a general truth; but it ceases to be a truth
        when one contracts it and applies it to an individual—provided
        that that individual is the author of this book, Senhor Pedro Carolino.
        I am sure I should not find it difficult “to enjoy well so much several
        languages”—or even a thousand of them—if he did the
        translating for me from the originals into his ostensible English.
