WHITEBROW
    

A HUNGRY she-wolf
      got up to go hunting. Her cubs, all three of them, were sound asleep,
      huddled in a heap and keeping each other warm. She licked them and went
      off.
    

      It was already March, a month of spring, but at night the trees snapped
      with the cold, as they do in December, and one could hardly put one’s
      tongue out without its being nipped. The wolf-mother was in delicate
      health and nervous; she started at the slightest sound, and kept hoping
      that no one would hurt the little ones at home while she was away. The
      smell of the tracks of men and horses, logs, piles of faggots, and the
      dark road with horse-dung on it frightened her; it seemed to her that men
      were standing behind the trees in the darkness, and that dogs were howling
      somewhere beyond the forest.
    

      She was no longer young and her scent had grown feebler, so that it
      sometimes happened that she took the track of a fox for that of a dog, and
      even at times lost her way, a thing that had never been in her youth.
      Owing to the weakness of her health she no longer hunted calves and big
      sheep as she had in old days, and kept her distance now from mares with
      colts; she fed on nothing but carrion; fresh meat she tasted very rarely,
      only in the spring when she would come upon a hare and take away her
      young, or make her way into a peasant’s stall where there were
      lambs.
    

      Some three miles from her lair there stood a winter hut on the posting
      road. There lived the keeper Ignat, an old man of seventy, who was always
      coughing and talking to himself; at night he was usually asleep, and by
      day he wandered about the forest with a single-barrelled gun, whistling to
      the hares. He must have worked among machinery in early days, for before
      he stood still he always shouted to himself: “Stop the machine!”
      and before going on: “Full speed!” He had a huge black dog of
      indeterminate breed, called Arapka. When it ran too far ahead he used to
      shout to it: “Reverse action!” Sometimes he used to sing, and
      as he did so staggered violently, and often fell down (the wolf thought
      the wind blew him over), and shouted: “Run off the rails!”
    

      The wolf remembered that, in the summer and autumn, a ram and two ewes
      were pasturing near the winter hut, and when she had run by not so long
      ago she fancied that she had heard bleating in the stall. And now, as she
      got near the place, she reflected that it was already March, and, by that
      time, there would certainly be lambs in the stall. She was tormented by
      hunger, she thought with what greediness she would eat a lamb, and these
      thoughts made her teeth snap, and her eyes glitter in the darkness like
      two sparks of light.
    

      Ignat’s hut, his barn, cattle-stall, and well were surrounded by
      high snowdrifts. All was still. Arapka was, most likely, asleep in the
      barn.
    

      The wolf clambered over a snowdrift on to the stall, and began scratching
      away the thatched roof with her paws and her nose. The straw was rotten
      and decaying, so that the wolf almost fell through; all at once a smell of
      warm steam, of manure, and of sheep’s milk floated straight to her
      nostrils. Down below, a lamb, feeling the cold, bleated softly. Leaping
      through the hole, the wolf fell with her four paws and chest on something
      soft and warm, probably a sheep, and at the same moment, something in the
      stall suddenly began whining, barking, and going off into a shrill little
      yap; the sheep huddled against the wall, and the wolf, frightened,
      snatched the first thing her teeth fastened on, and dashed away. . . .
    

      She ran at her utmost speed, while Arapka, who by now had scented the
      wolf, howled furiously, the frightened hens cackled, and Ignat, coming out
      into the porch, shouted: “Full speed! Blow the whistle!”
    

      And he whistled like a steam-engine, and then shouted: “Ho-ho-ho-ho!”
      and all this noise was repeated by the forest echo. When, little by
      little, it all died away, the wolf somewhat recovered herself, and began
      to notice that the prey she held in her teeth and dragged along the snow
      was heavier and, as it were, harder than lambs usually were at that
      season; and it smelt somehow different, and uttered strange sounds. . . .
      The wolf stopped and laid her burden on the snow, to rest and begin eating
      it, then all at once she leapt back in disgust. It was not a lamb, but a
      black puppy, with a big head and long legs, of a large breed, with a white
      patch on his brow, like Arapka’s. Judging from his manners he was a
      simple, ignorant, yard-dog. He licked his crushed and wounded back, and,
      as though nothing was the matter, wagged his tail and barked at the wolf.
      She growled like a dog, and ran away from him. He ran after her. She
      looked round and snapped her teeth. He stopped in perplexity, and,
      probably deciding that she was playing with him, craned his head in the
      direction he had come from, and went off into a shrill, gleeful bark, as
      though inviting his mother Arapka to play with him and the wolf.
    

      It was already getting light, and when the wolf reached her home in the
      thick aspen wood, each aspen tree could be seen distinctly, and the
      woodcocks were already awake, and the beautiful male birds often flew up,
      disturbed by the incautious gambols and barking of the puppy.
    

      “Why does he run after me?” thought the wolf with annoyance.
      “I suppose he wants me to eat him.”
    

      She lived with her cubs in a shallow hole; three years before, a tall old
      pine tree had been torn up by the roots in a violent storm, and the hole
      had been formed by it. Now there were dead leaves and moss at the bottom,
      and around it lay bones and bullocks’ horns, with which the little
      ones played. They were by now awake, and all three of them, very much
      alike, were standing in a row at the edge of their hole, looking at their
      returning mother, and wagging their tails. Seeing them, the puppy stopped
      a little way off, and stared at them for a very long time; seeing that
      they, too, were looking very attentively at him, he began barking angrily,
      as at strangers.
    

      By now it was daylight and the sun had risen, the snow sparkled all
      around, but still the puppy stood a little way off and barked. The cubs
      sucked their mother, pressing her thin belly with their paws, while she
      gnawed a horse’s bone, dry and white; she was tormented by hunger,
      her head ached from the dog’s barking, and she felt inclined to fall
      on the uninvited guest and tear him to pieces.
    

      At last the puppy was hoarse and exhausted; seeing they were not afraid of
      him, and not even attending to him, he began somewhat timidly approaching
      the cubs, alternately squatting down and bounding a few steps forward.
      Now, by daylight, it was easy to have a good look at him. . . . His white
      forehead was big, and on it was a hump such as is only seen on very stupid
      dogs; he had little, blue, dingy-looking eyes, and the expression of his
      whole face was extremely stupid. When he reached the cubs he stretched out
      his broad paws, laid his head upon them, and began:
    

      “Mnya, myna . . . nga—nga—nga . . . !”
    

      The cubs did not understand what he meant, but they wagged their tails.
      Then the puppy gave one of the cubs a smack on its big head with his paw.
      The cub, too, gave him a smack on the head. The puppy stood sideways to
      him, and looked at him askance, wagging his tail, then dashed off, and ran
      round several times on the frozen snow. The cubs ran after him, he fell on
      his back and kicked up his legs, and all three of them fell upon him,
      squealing with delight, and began biting him, not to hurt but in play. The
      crows sat on the high pine tree, and looked down on their struggle, and
      were much troubled by it. They grew noisy and merry. The sun was hot, as
      though it were spring; and the woodcocks, continually flitting through the
      pine tree that had been blown down by the storm, looked as though made of
      emerald in the brilliant sunshine.
    

      As a rule, wolf-mothers train their children to hunt by giving them prey
      to play with; and now watching the cubs chasing the puppy over the frozen
      snow and struggling with him, the mother thought:
    

      “Let them learn.”
    

      When they had played long enough, the cubs went into the hole and lay down
      to sleep. The puppy howled a little from hunger, then he, too, stretched
      out in the sunshine. And when they woke up they began playing again.
    

      All day long, and in the evening, the wolf-mother was thinking how the
      lamb had bleated in the cattle-shed the night before, and how it had smelt
      of sheep’s milk, and she kept snapping her teeth from hunger, and
      never left off greedily gnawing the old bone, pretending to herself that
      it was the lamb. The cubs sucked their mother, and the puppy, who was
      hungry, ran round them and sniffed at the snow.
    

      “I’ll eat him . . .” the mother-wolf decided.
    

      She went up to him, and he licked her nose and yapped at her, thinking
      that she wanted to play with him. In the past she had eaten dogs, but the
      dog smelt very doggy, and in the delicate state of her health she could
      not endure the smell; she felt disgusted and walked away. . . .
    

      Towards night it grew cold. The puppy felt depressed and went home.
    

      When the wolf-cubs were fast asleep, their mother went out hunting again.
      As on the previous night she was alarmed at every sound, and she was
      frightened by the stumps, the logs, the dark juniper bushes, which stood
      out singly, and in the distance were like human beings. She ran on the
      ice-covered snow, keeping away from the road. . . . All at once she caught
      a glimpse of something dark, far away on the road. She strained her eyes
      and ears: yes, something really was walking on in front, she could even
      hear the regular thud of footsteps. Surely not a badger? Cautiously
      holding her breath, and keeping always to one side, she overtook the dark
      patch, looked round, and recognised it. It was the puppy with the white
      brow, going with a slow, lingering step homewards.
    

      “If only he doesn’t hinder me again,” thought the wolf,
      and ran quickly on ahead.
    

      But the homestead was by now near. Again she clambered on to the
      cattle-shed by the snowdrift. The gap she had made yesterday had been
      already mended with straw, and two new rafters stretched across the roof.
      The wolf began rapidly working with her legs and nose, looking round to
      see whether the puppy were coming, but the smell of the warm steam and
      manure had hardly reached her nose before she heard a gleeful burst of
      barking behind her. It was the puppy. He leapt up to the wolf on the roof,
      then into the hole, and, feeling himself at home in the warmth,
      recognising his sheep, he barked louder than ever. . . . Arapka woke up in
      the barn, and, scenting a wolf, howled, the hens began cackling, and by
      the time Ignat appeared in the porch with his single-barrelled gun the
      frightened wolf was already far away.
    

      “Fuite!” whistled Ignat. “Fuite! Full steam ahead!”
    

      He pulled the trigger—the gun missed fire; he pulled the trigger
      again—again it missed fire; he tried a third time—and a great
      blaze of flame flew out of the barrel and there was a deafening boom,
      boom. It kicked him violently on the shoulder, and, taking his gun in one
      hand and his axe in the other, he went to see what the noise was about.
    

      A little later he went back to the hut.
    

      “What was it?” a pilgrim, who was staying the night at the hut
      and had been awakened by the noise, asked in a husky voice.
    

      “It’s all right,” answered Ignat. “Nothing of
      consequence. Our Whitebrow has taken to sleeping with the sheep in the
      warm. Only he hasn’t the sense to go in at the door, but always
      tries to wriggle in by the roof. The other night he tore a hole in the
      roof and went off on the spree, the rascal, and now he has come back and
      scratched away the roof again.”
    

      “Stupid dog.”
    

      “Yes, there is a spring snapped in his brain. I do detest fools,”
      sighed Ignat, clambering on to the stove. “Come, man of God, it’s
      early yet to get up. Let us sleep full steam! . . .”
    

      In the morning he called Whitebrow, smacked him hard about the ears, and
      then showing him a stick, kept repeating to him:
    

      “Go in at the door! Go in at the door! Go in at the door!”
