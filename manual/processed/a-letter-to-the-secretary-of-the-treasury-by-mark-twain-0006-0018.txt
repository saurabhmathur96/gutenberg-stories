A LETTER TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY

 Riverdale-on-the-Hudson, OCTOBER 15, 1902.

 The Hon. The Secretary Of The Treasury, Washington, D. C. :

 Sir,â€”Prices for the customary kinds of winter fuel having reached
        an altitude which puts them out of the reach of literary persons in
        straitened circumstances, I desire to place with you the following
        order:

 Forty-five tons best old dry government bonds, suitable for furnace,
        gold 7 per cents., 1864, preferred.

 Twelve tons early greenbacks, range size, suitable for cooking.

 Eight barrels seasoned 25 and 50 cent postal currency, vintage of 1866,
        eligible for kindlings.

 Please deliver with all convenient despatch at my house in Riverdale at
        lowest rates for spot cash, and send bill to

 Your obliged servant,

 Mark Twain, Who will be very grateful, and will vote right.
