AFTER THE THEATRE

  N

ADYA ZELENIN had
      just come back with her mamma from the theatre where she had seen a
      performance of “Yevgeny Onyegin.” As soon as she reached her
      own room she threw off her dress, let down her hair, and in her petticoat
      and white dressing-jacket hastily sat down to the table to write a letter
      like Tatyana’s.

 “I love you,” she wrote, “but you do not love me, do not
      love me!”

 She wrote it and laughed.

 She was only sixteen and did not yet love anyone. She knew that an officer
      called Gorny and a student called Gruzdev loved her, but now after the
      opera she wanted to be doubtful of their love. To be unloved and unhappy—how
      interesting that was. There is something beautiful, touching, and poetical
      about it when one loves and the other is indifferent. Onyegin was
      interesting because he was not in love at all, and Tatyana was fascinating
      because she was so much in love; but if they had been equally in love with
      each other and had been happy, they would perhaps have seemed dull.

 “Leave off declaring that you love me,” Nadya went on writing,
      thinking of Gorny. “I cannot believe it. You are very clever,
      cultivated, serious, you have immense talent, and perhaps a brilliant
      future awaits you, while I am an uninteresting girl of no importance, and
      you know very well that I should be only a hindrance in your life. It is
      true that you were attracted by me and thought you had found your ideal in
      me, but that was a mistake, and now you are asking yourself in despair:
      ‘Why did I meet that girl?’ And only your goodness of heart
      prevents you from owning it to yourself....”

 Nadya felt sorry for herself, she began to cry, and went on:

 “It is hard for me to leave my mother and my brother, or I should
      take a nun’s veil and go whither chance may lead me. And you would
      be left free and would love another. Oh, if I were dead!”

 She could not make out what she had written through her tears; little
      rainbows were quivering on the table, on the floor, on the ceiling, as
      though she were looking through a prism. She could not write, she sank
      back in her easy-chair and fell to thinking of Gorny.

 My God! how interesting, how fascinating men were! Nadya recalled the fine
      expression, ingratiating, guilty, and soft, which came into the officer’s
      face when one argued about music with him, and the effort he made to
      prevent his voice from betraying his passion. In a society where cold
      haughtiness and indifference are regarded as signs of good breeding and
      gentlemanly bearing, one must conceal one’s passions. And he did try
      to conceal them, but he did not succeed, and everyone knew very well that
      he had a passionate love of music. The endless discussions about music and
      the bold criticisms of people who knew nothing about it kept him always on
      the strain; he was frightened, timid, and silent. He played the piano
      magnificently, like a professional pianist, and if he had not been in the
      army he would certainly have been a famous musician.

 The tears on her eyes dried. Nadya remembered that Gorny had declared his
      love at a Symphony concert, and again downstairs by the hatstand where
      there was a tremendous draught blowing in all directions.

 “I am very glad that you have at last made the acquaintance of
      Gruzdev, our student friend,” she went on writing. “He is a
      very clever man, and you will be sure to like him. He came to see us
      yesterday and stayed till two o’clock. We were all delighted with
      him, and I regretted that you had not come. He said a great deal that was
      remarkable.”

 Nadya laid her arms on the table and leaned her head on them, and her hair
      covered the letter. She recalled that the student, too, loved her, and
      that he had as much right to a letter from her as Gorny. Wouldn’t it
      be better after all to write to Gruzdev? There was a stir of joy in her
      bosom for no reason whatever; at first the joy was small, and rolled in
      her bosom like an india-rubber ball; then it became more massive, bigger,
      and rushed like a wave. Nadya forgot Gorny and Gruzdev; her thoughts were
      in a tangle and her joy grew and grew; from her bosom it passed into her
      arms and legs, and it seemed as though a light, cool breeze were breathing
      on her head and ruffling her hair. Her shoulders quivered with subdued
      laughter, the table and the lamp chimney shook, too, and tears from her
      eyes splashed on the letter. She could not stop laughing, and to prove to
      herself that she was not laughing about nothing she made haste to think of
      something funny.

 “What a funny poodle,” she said, feeling as though she would
      choke with laughter. “What a funny poodle!”

 She thought how, after tea the evening before, Gruzdev had played with
      Maxim the poodle, and afterwards had told them about a very intelligent
      poodle who had run after a crow in the yard, and the crow had looked round
      at him and said: “Oh, you scamp!”

 The poodle, not knowing he had to do with a learned crow, was fearfully
      confused and retreated in perplexity, then began barking....

 “No, I had better love Gruzdev,” Nadya decided, and she tore
      up the letter to Gorny.

 She fell to thinking of the student, of his love, of her love; but the
      thoughts in her head insisted on flowing in all directions, and she
      thought about everything—about her mother, about the street, about
      the pencil, about the piano.... She thought of them joyfully, and felt
      that everything was good, splendid, and her joy told her that this was not
      all, that in a little while it would be better still. Soon it would be
      spring, summer, going with her mother to Gorbiki. Gorny would come for his
      furlough, would walk about the garden with her and make love to her.
      Gruzdev would come too. He would play croquet and skittles with her, and
      would tell her wonderful things. She had a passionate longing for the
      garden, the darkness, the pure sky, the stars. Again her shoulders shook
      with laughter, and it seemed to her that there was a scent of wormwood in
      the room and that a twig was tapping at the window.

 She went to her bed, sat down, and not knowing what to do with the immense
      joy which filled her with yearning, she looked at the holy image hanging
      at the back of her bed, and said:

 “Oh, Lord God! Oh, Lord God!”
