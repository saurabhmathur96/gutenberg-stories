      The medical student Mayer, and Ribnikov, a student at the Moscow school of
      painting, sculpture, and architecture, came one evening to their friend
      Vassiliev, law student, and proposed that he should go with them to S——v
      Street. For a long while Vassiliev did not agree, but eventually dressed
      himself and went with them.
    

      Unfortunate women he knew only by hearsay and from books, and never once
      in his life had he been in the houses where they live. He knew there were
      immoral women who were forced by the pressure of disastrous circumstances—environment,
      bad up-bringing, poverty, and the like—to sell their honour for
      money. They do not know pure love, have no children and no legal rights;
      mothers and sisters mourn them for dead, science treats them as an evil,
      men are familiar with them. But notwithstanding all this they do not lose
      the image and likeness of God. They all acknowledge their sin and hope for
      salvation. They are free to avail themselves of every means of salvation.
      True, Society does not forgive people their past, but with God Mary of
      Egypt is not lower than the other saints. Whenever Vassiliev recognised an
      unfortunate woman in the street by her costume or her manner, or saw a
      picture of one in a comic paper, there came into his mind every time a
      story he once read somewhere: a pure and heroic young man falls in love
      with an unfortunate woman and asks her to be his wife, but she,
      considering herself unworthy of such happiness, poisons herself.
    

      Vassiliev lived in one of the streets off the Tverskoi boulevard. When he
      and his friends came out of the house it was about eleven o'clock—the
      first snow had just fallen and all nature was under the spell of this new
      snow; The air smelt of snow, the snow cracked softly under foot, the
      earth, the roofs, the trees, the benches on the boulevards—all were
      soft, white, and young. Owing to this the houses had a different look from
      yesterday, the lamps burned brighter, the air was more transparent, the
      clatter of the cabs was dulled and there entered into the soul with the
      fresh, easy, frosty air a feeling like the white, young, feathery snow.
      "To these sad shores unknowing" the medico began to sing in a pleasant
      tenor, "An unknown power entices...."
    

      "Behold the mill" ... the painter's voice took him up, "it is now fall'n
      to ruin."
    

      "Behold the mill, it is now fall'n to ruin," the medico repeated, raising
      his eyebrows and sadly shaking his head.
    

      He was silent for a while, passed his hand over his forehead trying to
      recall the words, and began to sing in a loud voice and so well that the
      passers-by looked back.
    

      "Here, long ago, came free, free love to me"...
    

      All three went into a restaurant and without taking off their coats they
      each had two thimblefuls of vodka at the bar. Before drinking the second,
      Vassiliev noticed a piece of cork in his Vodka, lifted the glass to his
      eye, looked at it for a long while with a short-sighted frown. The medico
      misunderstood his expression and said—
    

      "Well, what are you staring at? No philosophy, please. Vodka's made to be
      drunk, caviare to be eaten, women to sleep with, snow to walk on. Live
      like a man for one evening."
    

      "Well, I've nothing to say," said Vassiliev laughingly, "I'm not
      refusing?"
    

      The vodka warmed his breast. He looked at his friends, admired and envied
      them. How balanced everything is in these healthy, strong, cheerful
      people. Everything in their minds and souls is smooth and rounded off.
      They sing, have a passion for the theatre, paint, talk continually, and
      drink, and they never have a headache the next day. They are romantic and
      dissolute, sentimental and insolent; they can work and go on the loose and
      laugh at nothing and talk rubbish; they are hot-headed, honest, heroic and
      as human beings not a bit worse than Vassiliev, who watches his every step
      and word, who is careful, cautious, and able to give the smallest trifle
      the dignity of a problem. And he made tip his mind if only for one evening
      to live like his friends, to let himself go, and be free from his own
      control. Must he drink vodka? He'll drink, even if his head falls to
      pieces to-morrow. Must he be taken to women? He'll go. He'll laugh, play
      the fool, and give a joking answer to disapproving passers-by.
    

      He came out of the restaurant laughing. He liked his friends—one in
      a battered hat with a wide brim who aped aesthetic disorder; the other in
      a sealskin cap, not very poor, with a pretence of learned Bohemia. He
      liked the snow, the paleness, the lamp-lights, the dear black prints which
      the passers' feet left on the snow. He liked the air, and above all the
      transparent, tender, naive, virgin tone which can be seen in nature only
      twice in the year: when everything is covered in snow, on the bright days
      in spring, and on moonlight nights when the ice breaks on the river.
    

      "To these sad shores unknowing," he began to sing sotto-voce, "An
      unknown power entices."
    

      And all the way for some reason or other he and his friends had this
      melody on their lips. All three hummed it mechanically out of time with
      each other.
    

      Vassiliev Imagined how in about ten minutes he and his friends would knock
      at a door, how they would stealthily walk through-the narrow little
      passages and dark rooms to the women, how he would take advantage of the
      dark, suddenly strike a match, and see lit up a suffering face and a
      guilty smile. There he will surely find a fair or a dark woman in a white
      nightgown with her hair loose. She will be frightened of the light,
      dreadfully confused and say: "Good God! What are you doing? Blow it out!"
      All this was frightening, but curious and novel.
    


      II
    

      The friends turned out of Trubnoi Square into the Grachovka and soon
      arrived at the street which Vassiliev knew only from hearsay. Seeing two
      rows of houses with brightly lighted windows and wide open doors, and
      hearing the gay sound of pianos and fiddles—sounds which flew out of
      all the doors and mingled in a strange confusion, as if somewhere in the
      darkness over the roof-tops an unseen orchestra were tuning, Vassiliev was
      bewildered and said:
    

      "What a lot of houses!"
    

      "What's that?" said the medico. "There are ten times as many in London.
      There are a hundred thousand of these women there."
    

      The cabmen sat on their boxes quiet and indifferent as in other streets;
      on the pavement walked the same passers-by. No one was in a hurry; no one
      hid his face in his collar; no one shook his head reproachfully. And in
      this indifference, in the confused sound of the pianos and fiddles, in the
      bright windows and wide-open doors, something very free, impudent, bold
      and daring could be felt. It must have been the same as this in the old
      times on the slave-markets, as gay and as noisy; people looked and walked
      with the same indifference.
    

      "Let's begin right at the beginning," said the painter.
    

      The friends walked into a narrow little passage lighted by a single lamp
      with a reflector. When they opened the door a man in a black jacket rose
      lazily from the yellow sofa in the hall. He had an unshaven lackey's face
      and sleepy eyes. The place smelt like a laundry, and of vinegar. From the
      hall a door led into a brightly lighted room. The medico and the painter
      stopped in the doorway, stretched out their necks and peeped into the room
      together:
    

      "Buona sera, signore, Rigoletto—huguenote—traviata!—"
      the painter began, making a theatrical bow.
    

      "Havanna—blackbeetlano—pistoletto!" said the medico, pressing
      his hat to his heart and bowing low.
    

      Vassiliev kept behind them. He wanted to bow theatrically too and say
      something silly. But he only smiled, felt awkward and ashamed, and awaited
      impatiently what was to follow. In the door appeared a little fair girl of
      seventeen or eighteen, with short hair, wearing a short blue dress with a
      white bow on her breast.
    

      "What are you standing in the door for?" she said. "Take off your
      overcoats and come into the salon."
    

      The medico and the painter went into the salon, still speaking Italian.
      Vassiliev followed them irresolutely.
    

      "Gentlemen, take off your overcoats," said the lackey stiffly. "You're not
      allowed in as you are."
    

      Besides the fair girl there was another woman in the salon, very stout and
      tall, with a foreign face and bare arms. She sat by the piano, with a game
      of patience spread on her knees. She took no notice of the guests.
    

      "Where are the other girls?" asked the medico.
    

      "They're drinking tea," said the fair one. "Stiepan," she called out. "Go
      and tell the girls some students have come!"
    

      A little later a third girl entered, in a bright red dress with blue
      stripes. Her face was thickly and unskilfully painted. Her forehead was
      hidden under her hair. She stared with dull, frightened eyes. As she came
      she immediately began to sing in a strong hoarse contralto. After her a
      fourth girl. After her a fifth.
    

      In all this Vassiliev saw nothing new or curious. It seemed to him that he
      had seen before, and more than once, this salon, piano, cheap gilt mirror,
      the white bow, the dress with blue stripes and the stupid, indifferent
      faces. But of darkness, quiet, mystery, and guilty smile—of all he
      had expected to meet here and which frightened him—he did not see
      even a shadow.
    

      Everything was commonplace, prosaic, and dull. Only one thing provoked his
      curiosity a little, that was the terrible, as it were intentional lack of
      taste, which was seen in the overmantels, the absurd pictures, the dresses
      and the White bow. In this lack of taste there was something
      characteristic and singular.
    

      "How poor and foolish it all is!" thought Vassiliev. "What is there in all
      this rubbish to tempt a normal man, to provoke him into committing a
      frightful sin, to buy a living soul for a rouble? I can understand anyone
      sinning for the sake of splendour, beauty, grace, passion; but what is
      there here? What tempts people here? But ... it's no good thinking!"
    

      "Whiskers, stand me champagne." The fair one turned to him.
    

      Vassiliev suddenly blushed.
    

      "With pleasure," he said, bowing politely. "But excuse me if I ... I don't
      drink with you, I don't drink."
    

      Five minutes after the friends were off to another house.
    

      "Why did you order drinks?" stormed the medico. "What a millionaire,
      flinging six roubles into the gutter like that for nothing at all."
    

      "Why shouldn't I give her pleasure if she wants it?" said Vassiliev,
      justifying himself.
    

      "You didn't give her any pleasure. Madame got that. It's Madame who tells
      them to ask the guests for drinks. She makes by it."
    

      "Behold the mill," the painter began to sing, "Now fall'n to ruin...."
    

      When they came to another house the friends stood outside in the
      vestibule, but did not enter the salon. As in the first house, a figure
      rose up from the sofa in the hall, in a black jacket, with a sleepy
      lackey's face. As he looked at this lackey, at his face and shabby jacket,
      Vassiliev thought: "What must an ordinary simple Russian go through before
      Fate casts him up here? Where was he before, and what was he doing? What
      awaits him? Is he married, where's his mother, and does she know he's a
      lackey here?" Thenceforward in every house Vassiliev involuntarily turned
      his attention to the lackey first of all.
    

      In one of the houses, it seemed to be the fourth, the lackey was a dry
      little, puny fellow, with a chain across his waistcoat. He was reading a
      newspaper and took no notice of the guests at all. Glancing at his face,
      Vassiliev had the idea that a fellow with a face like that could steal and
      murder and perjure. And indeed the face was interesting: a big forehead,
      grey eyes, a flat little nose, small close-set teeth, and the expression
      on his face dull and impudent at once, like a puppy hard on a hare.
      Vassiliev had the thought that he would like to touch this lackey's hair:
      is it rough or soft f It must be rough like a dog's.
    


      III
    

      Because he had had two glasses the painter suddenly got rather drunk, and
      unnaturally lively.
    

      "Let's go to another place," he added, waving his hands. "I'll introduce
      you to the best!"
    

      When he had taken his friends into the house which was according to him
      the best, he proclaimed a persistent desire to dance a quadrille. The
      medico began to grumble that they would have to pay the musicians a rouble
      but agreed to be his vis-Ã -vis. The dance began.
    

      It was just as bad in the best house as in the worst. Just the same
      mirrors and pictures were here, the same coiffures and dresses. Looking
      round at the furniture and the costumes Vassiliev now understood that it
      was not lack of taste, but something that might be called the particular
      taste and style of S——v Street, quite impossible to find
      anywhere else, something complete, not accidental, evolved in time. After
      he had been to eight houses he no longer wondered at the colour of the
      dresses or the long trains, or at the bright bows, or the sailor dresses,
      or the thick violent painting of the cheeks; he understood that all this
      was in harmony, that if only one woman dressed herself humanly, or one
      decent print hung on the wall, then the general tone of the whole street
      would suffer.
    

      How badly they manage the business? Can't they really understand that vice
      is only fascinating when it is beautiful and secret, hidden under the
      cloak of virtue? Modest black dresses, pale faces, sad smiles, and
      darkness act more strongly than this clumsy tinsel. Idiots! If they don't
      understand it themselves, their guests ought to teach them....
    

      A girl in a Polish costume trimmed with white fur came up close to him and
      sat down by his side.
    

      "Why don't you dance, my brown-haired darling?" she asked. "What do you
      fed so bored about?"
    

      "Because it is boring."
    

      "Stand me a ChÃ¢teau Lafitte, then you won't be bored."
    

      Vassiliev made no answer. For a little while he was silent, then he asked:
    

      "What time do you go to bed as a rule?"
    

      "Six."
    

      "When do you get up?"
    

      "Sometimes two, sometimes three."
    

      "And after you get up what do you do?"
    

      "We drink coffee. We have dinner at seven."
    

      "And what do you have for dinner?"
    

      "Soup or schi as a rule, beef-steak, dessert. Our madame keeps the
      girls well. But what are you asking all this for?"
    

      "Just to have a talk...."
    

      Vassiliev wanted to ask about all sorts of things. He had a strong desire
      to find out where she came from, were her parents alive, and did they know
      she was here; how she got into the house; was she happy and contented, or
      gloomy and depressed with dark thoughts. Does she ever hope to escape....
      But he could not possibly think how to begin, or how to put his questions
      without seeming indiscreet. He thought for a long while and asked:
    

      "How old are you?"
    

      "Eighty," joked the girl, looking and laughing at the tricks the painter
      was doing with his hands and feet.
    

      She suddenly giggled and uttered a long filthy expression aloud so that
      every one could hear.
    

      Vassiliev, terrified, not knowing how to look, began to laugh uneasily. He
      alone smiled: all the others, his friends, the musicians and the women—paid
      no attention to his neighbour. They might never have heard.
    

      "Stand me a Lafitte," said the girl again.
    

      Vassiliev was suddenly repelled by her white trimming and her voice and
      left her. It seemed to him close and hot. His heart began to beat slowly
      and violently, like a hammer, one, two, three.
    

      "Let's get out of here," he said, pulling the painter's sleeve.
    

      "Wait. Let's finish it."
    

      While the medico and the painter were finishing their quadrille,
      Vassiliev, in order to avoid the women, eyed the musicians. The pianist
      was a nice old man with spectacles, with a face like Marshal Basin; the
      fiddler a young man with a short, fair beard dressed in the latest
      fashion. The young man was not stupid or starved, on the contrary he
      looked clever, young and fresh. He was dressed with a touch of
      originality, and played with emotion. Problem: how did he and the decent
      old man get here? Why aren't they ashamed to sit here? What do they think
      about when they look at the women?
    

      If the piano and the fiddle were played by ragged, hungry, gloomy, drunken
      creatures, with thin stupid faces, then their presence would perhaps be
      intelligible. As it was, Vassiliev could understand. nothing. Into his
      memory came the story that he had read about the unfortunate woman, and
      now he found that the human figure with the guilty smile had nothing to do
      with this. It seemed to him that they were not unfortunate women that he
      saw, but they belonged to another, utterly different world, foreign and
      inconceivable to him; if he had seen this world on the stage or read about
      it in a book he would never have believed it.... The girl with the white
      trimming giggled again and said something disgusting aloud. He felt sick,
      blushed, and went out:
    

      "Wait. We're coming too," cried the painter.
    


      IV
    

      "I had a talk with my mam'selle while we were dancing," said the
      medico when all three came into the street. "The subject was her first
      love. He was a bookkeeper in Smolensk with a wife and five
      children. She was seventeen and lived with her pa and ma who kept a soap
      and candle shop."
    

      "How did he conquer her heart?" asked Vassiliev.
    

      "He bought her fifty roubles'-worth of underclothes—Lord knows
      what!"
    

      "However could he get her love-story out of his girl?" thought Vassiliev.
      "I can't. My dear chaps, I'm off home," he said.
    

      "Why?"
    

      "Because I don't know how to get on here. I'm bored and disgusted. What is
      there amusing about it? If they were only human beings; but they're
      savages and beasts. I'm going, please."
    

      "Grisha darling, please," the painter said with a sob in his voice,
      pressing close to Vassiliev, "let's go to one more—then to Hell with
      them. Do come, Grigor."
    

      They prevailed on Vassiliev and led him up a staircase. The carpet and the
      gilded balustrade, the porter who opened the door, the panels which
      decorated the hall, were still in the same S——v Street style,
      but here it was perfected and imposing.
    

      "Really I'm going home," said Vassiliev, taking off his overcoat.
    

      "Darling, please, please," said the painter and kissed him on the neck.
      "Don't be so faddy, Grigri—be a pal. Together we came, together we
      go. What a beast you are though!"
    

      "I can wait for you in the street. My God, it's disgusting here."
    

      "Please, please.... You just look on, see, just look on."
    

      "One should look at things objectively," said the medico seriously.
    

      Vassiliev entered the salon and sat down. There were many more guests
      besides him and his friends: two infantry officers, a grey, bald-headed
      gentleman with gold spectacles, two young clean-shaven men from the
      Surveyors' Institute, and a very drunk man with an actor's face. All the
      girls were looking after these guests and took no notice of Vassiliev.
      Only one of them dressed like AÃ¯da glanced at him sideways, smiled at
      something and said with a yawn:
    

      "So the dark one's come."
    

      Vassiliev's heart was beating and his face was burning. He felt ashamed
      for being there, disgusted and tormented. He was tortured by the thought
      that he, a decent and affectionate man (so he considered himself up till
      now), despised these women and felt nothing towards them but repulsion. He
      could not feel pity for them or for the musicians or the lackeys.
    

      "It's because I don't try to understand them," he thought. "They're all
      more like beasts than human beings; but all the same they are human
      beings. They've got souls. One should understand them first, then judge
      them."
    

      "Grisha, don't go away. Wait for us," called the painter; and he
      disappeared somewhere.
    

      Soon the medico disappeared also.
    

      "Yes, one should try to understand. It's no good, otherwise," thought
      Vassiliev, and he began to examine intently the face of each girl, looking
      for the guilty smile. But whether he could not read faces or because none
      of these women felt guilty he saw in each face only a dull look of common,
      vulgar boredom and satiety. Stupid eyes, stupid smiles, harsh, stupid
      voices, impudent gestures—and nothing else. Evidently every woman
      had in her past a love romance with a bookkeeper and fifty roubles'-worth
      of underclothes. And in the present the only good things in life were
      coffee, a three-course dinner, wine, quadrilles, and sleeping till two in
      the afternoon....
    

      Finding not one guilty smile, Vassiliev began to examine them to see if
      even one looked clever and his attention was arrested by one pale, rather
      tired face. It was that of a dark woman no longer young, wearing a dress
      scattered with spangles. She sat in a chair staring at the floor and
      thinking of something. Vassiliev paced up and down and then sat down
      beside her as if by accident.
    

      "One must begin with something trivial," he thought, "and gradually pass
      on to serious conversation...."
    

      "What a beautiful little dress you have on," he said, and touched the gold
      fringe of her scarf with his finger.
    

      "It's all right," said the dark woman.
    

      "Where do you come from?"
    

      "I? A long way. From Tchernigov."
    

      "It's a nice part."
    

      "It always is, where you don't happen to be."
    

      "What a pity I can't describe nature," thought Vassiliev. "I'd move her by
      descriptions of Tchernigov. She must love it if she was born there."
    

      "Do you feel lonely here?" he asked.
    

      "Of course I'm lonely."
    

      "Why don't you go away from here, if you're lonely?"
    

      "Where shall I go to? Start begging, eh?"
    

      "It's easier to beg than to live here."
    

      "Where did you get that idea? Have you been a beggar?"
    

      "I begged, when I hadn't enough to pay my university fees; and even if I
      hadn't begged it's easy enough to understand. A beggar is a free man, at
      any rate, and you're a slave."
    

      The dark woman stretched herself, and followed with sleepy eyes the lackey
      who carried a tray of glasses and soda-water.
    

      "Stand us a champagne," she said, and yawned again.
    

      "Champagne," said Vassiliev. "What would happen if your mother or your
      brother suddenly came in? What would you say? And what would they say? You
      would say 'champagne' then."
    

      Suddenly the noise of crying was heard. From the next room where the
      lackey had carried the soda-water, a fair man rushed out with a red face
      and angry eyes. He was followed by the tall, stout madame, who screamed in
      a squeaky voice:
    

      "No one gave you permission to slap the girls in the face. Better class
      than you come here, and never slap a girl. You bounder!"
    

      Followed an uproar. Vassiliev was scared and went white. In the next room
      some one wept, sobbing, sincerely, as only the insulted weep. And he
      understood that indeed human beings lived here, actually human beings, who
      get offended, suffer, weep, and ask for help. The smouldering hatred, the
      feeling of repulsion, gave way to an acute sense of pity and anger against
      the wrong-doer. He rushed into the room from which the weeping came.
      Through the rows of bottles which stood on the marble table-top he saw a
      suffering tear-stained face, stretched out his hands towards this face,
      stepped to the table and instantly gave a leap back in terror. The sobbing
      woman was dead-drunk.
    

      As he made his way through the noisy crowd, gathered round the fair man,
      his heart failed him, he lost his courage like a boy, and it seemed to him
      that in this foreign, inconceivable world, they wanted to run after him,
      to beat him, to abuse him with foul words. He tore down his coat from the
      peg and rushed headlong down the stairs.
    


      V
    

      Pressing dose to the fence, he stood near to the house and waited for his
      friends to come out. The sounds of the pianos and fiddles, gay, bold,
      impudent and sad, mingled into chaos in the air, and this confusion was,
      as before, as if an unseen orchestra were tuning in the dark over the
      roof-tops. If he looked up towards the darkness, then all the background
      was scattered with white, moving points: it was snowing. The flakes,
      coming into the light, spun lazily in the air like feathers, and still
      more lazily fell. Flakes of snow crowded whirling about Vassiliev, and
      hung on his beard, his eyelashes, his eyebrows. The cabmen, the horses,
      and the passers-by, all were white.
    

      "How dare the snow fall in this street?" thought Vassiliev. "A curse on
      these houses."
    

      Because of his headlong rush down the staircase his feet failed him from
      weariness; he was out of breath as if he had climbed a mountain. His heart
      beat so loud that he could hear it. A longing came over him to get out of
      this street as soon as possible and go home; but still stronger was his
      desire to wait for his friends and to vent upon them his feeling of
      heaviness.
    

      He had not understood many things in the houses. The souls of the
      perishing women were to him a mystery as before; but it was dear to him
      that the business was much worse than one would have thought. If the
      guilty woman who poisoned herself was called a prostitute, then it was
      hard to find a suitable name for all these creatures, who danced to the
      muddling music and said long, disgusting phrases. They were not perishing;
      they were already done for.
    

      "Vice is here," he thought; "but there is neither confession of sin nor
      hope of salvation. They are bought and sold, drowned in wine and torpor,
      and they are dull and indifferent as sheep and do not understand. My God,
      my God!"
    

      It was so dear to him that all that which is called human dignity,
      individuality, the image and likeness of God, was here dragged down to the
      gutter, as they say of drunkards, and that not only the street and the
      stupid women were to blame for it.
    

      A crowd of students white with snow, talking and laughing gaily, passed
      by. One of them, a tall, thin man, peered into Vassiliev's face and said
      drunkenly, "He's one of ours. Logged, old man? Aha! my lad. Never mind.
      Walk up, never say die, uncle."
    

      He took Vassiliev by the shoulders and pressed his cold wet moustaches to
      his cheek, then slipped, staggered, brandished his arms, and cried out:
    

      "Steady there—don't fall."
    

      Laughing, he ran to join his comrades.
    

      Through the noise the painter's voice became audible.
    

      "You dare beat women! I won't have it. Go to Hell. You're regular swine."
    

      The medico appeared at the door of the house. He glanced round and on
      seeing Vassiliev, said in alarm:
    

      "Is that you? My God, it's simply impossible to go anywhere with Yegor. I
      can't understand a chap like that. He kicked up a row—can't you
      hear? Yegor," he called from the door. "Yegor!"
    

      "I won't have you hitting women." The painter's shrill voice was audible
      again from upstairs.
    

      Something heavy and bulky tumbled down the staircase. It was the painter
      coming head over heels. He had evidently been thrown out.
    

      He lifted himself up from the ground, dusted his hat, and with an angry
      indignant face, shook his fist at the upstairs.
    

      "Scoundrels! Butchers! Bloodsuckers! I won't have you hitting a weak,
      drunken woman. Ah, you...."
    

      "Yegor ... Yegor!" the medico began to implore, "I give my word I'll never
      go out with you again. Upon my honour, I won't."
    

      The painter gradually calmed, and the friends went home.
    

      "To these sad shores unknowing"—the medico began—"An unknown
      power entices...."
    

      "Behold the mill," the painter sang with him after a pause, "Now fallen
      into ruin." How the snow is falling, most Holy Mother. Why did you go
      away, Grisha? You're a coward; you're only an old woman."
    

      Vassiliev was walking behind his friends. He stared at their backs and
      thought: "One of two things: either prostitution only seems to us an evil
      and we exaggerate it, or if prostitution is really such an evil as is
      commonly thought, these charming friends of mine are just as much slavers,
      violators, and murderers as the inhabitants of Syria and Cairo whose
      photographs appear in 'The Field.' They're singing, laughing, arguing
      soundly now, but haven't they just been exploiting starvation, ignorance,
      and stupidity? They have, I saw them at it. Where does their humanity,
      their science, and their painting come in, then? The science, art, and
      lofty sentiments of these murderers remind me of the lump of fat in the
      story. Two robbers killed a beggar in a forest; they began to divide his
      clothes between themselves and found in his bag a lump of pork fat. 'In
      the nick of time,' said one of them. 'Let's have a bite!' 'How can you?'
      the other cried in terror. 'Have you forgotten to-day's Friday?' So they
      refrained from eating. After having cut the man's throat they walked out
      of the forest confident that they were pious fellows. These two are just
      the same. When they've paid for women they go and imagine they're painters
      and scholars....
    

      "Listen, you two," he said angrily and sharply. "Why do you go to those
      places? Can't you understand how horrible they are? Your medicine tells
      you every one of these women dies prematurely from consumption or
      something else; your arts tell you that she died morally still earlier.
      Each of them dies because during her lifetime she accepts on an average,
      let us say, five hundred men. Each of them is killed by five hundred men,
      and you're amongst the five hundred. Now if each of you comes here and to
      places like this two hundred and fifty times in his lifetime, then it
      means that between you you have killed one woman. Can't you understand
      that? Isn't it horrible?"
    

      "Ah, isn't this awful, my God?"
    

      "There, I knew it would end like this," said the painter frowning. "We
      oughtn't to have had anything to do with this fool of a blockhead. I
      suppose you think your head's full of great thoughts and great ideas now.
      Devil knows what they are, but they're not ideas. You're staring at me now
      with hatred and disgust; but if you want my opinion you'd better build
      twenty more of the houses than look like that. There's more vice in your
      look than in the whole street. Let's dear out, Volodya, damn him! He's a
      fool. He's a blockhead, and that's all he is."
    

      "Human beings are always killing each other," said the medico. "That is
      immoral, of course. But philosophy won't help you. Good-bye!"
    

      The friends parted at Trubnoi Square and went their way. Left alone,
      Vassiliev began to stride along the boulevard. He was frightened of the
      dark, frightened of the snow, which fell to the earth in little flakes,
      but seemed to long to cover the whole world; he was frightened of the
      street-lamps, which glimmered faintly through the clouds of snow. An
      inexplicable faint-hearted fear possessed his soul. Now and then people
      passed him; but he gave a start and stepped aside. It seemed to him that
      from everywhere there came and stared at him women, only women....
    

      "It's coming on," he thought, "I'm going to have a fit."
    


      VI
    

      At home he lay on his bed and began to talk, shivering all over his body.
    

      "Live women, live.... My God, they're alive."
    

      He sharpened the edge of his imagination in every possible way. Now he was
      the brother of an unfortunate, now her father. Now he was himself a fallen
      woman, with painted cheeks; and all this terrified him.
    

      It seemed to him somehow that he must solve this question immediately, at
      all costs, and that the problem was not strange to him, but was his own.
      He made a great effort, conquered his despair, and, sitting on the side of
      the bed, his head clutched in his hands, he began to think:
    

      How could all the women he had seen that night be saved? The process of
      solving a problem was familiar to him as to a learned person; and
      notwithstanding all his excitement he kept strictly to this process. He
      recalled to mind the history of the question, its literature, and just
      after three o'clock he was pacing up and down, trying to remember all the
      experiments which are practised nowadays for the salvation of women. He
      had a great many good friends who lived in furnished rooms, Falzfein,
      Galyashkin, Nechaiev, Yechkin ... not a few among them were honest and
      self-sacrificing, and some of them had attempted to save these women....
    

      All these few attempts, thought Vassiliev, rare attempts, may be divided
      into three groups. Some having rescued a woman from a brothel hired a room
      for her, bought her a sewing-machine and she became a dressmaker, and the
      man who saved her kept her for his mistress, openly or otherwise, but
      later when he had finished his studies and was going away, he would hand
      her over to another decent fellow. So the fallen woman remained fallen.
      Others after having bought her out also hired a room for her, bought the
      inevitable sewing-machine and started her off reading and writing and
      preached at her. The woman sits and sews as long as it is novel and
      amusing, but later, when she is bored, she begins to receive men secretly,
      or runs back to where she can sleep till three in the afternoon, drink
      coffee, and eat till she is full. Finally, the most ardent and
      self-sacrificing take a bold, determined step. They marry, and when the
      impudent, self-indulgent, stupefied creature becomes a wife, a lady of the
      house, and then a mother, her life and outlook are utterly changed, and in
      the wife and mother it is hard to recognise the unfortunate woman. Yes,
      marriage is the best, it may be the only, resource.
    

      "But it's impossible," Vassiliev said aloud and threw himself down on his
      bed. "First of all, I could not marry one. One would have to be a saint to
      be able to do it, unable to hate, not knowing disgust. But let us suppose
      that the painter, the medico, and I got the better of our feelings and
      married, that all these women got married, what is the result? What kind
      of effect follows? The result is that while the women get married here in
      Moscow, the Smolensk bookkeeper seduces a fresh lot, and these will pour
      into the empty places, together with women from Saratov, Nijni-Novgorod,
      Warsaw.... And what happens to the hundred thousand in London? What can be
      done with those in Hamburg?
    

      The oil in the lamp was used up and the lamp began to smell. Vassiliev did
      not notice it. Again he began to pace up and down, thinking. Now he put
      the question differently. What can be done to remove the demand for fallen
      women? For this it is necessary that the men who buy and kill them should
      at once begin to feel all the immorality of their rÃ´le of
      slave-owners, and this should terrify them. It is necessary to save the
      men.
    

      Science and art apparently won't do, thought Vassiliev. There is only one
      way out—to be an apostle.
    

      And he began to dream how he would stand to-morrow evening at the corner
      of the street and say to each passer-by: "Where are you going and what
      for? Fear God!"
    

      He would turn to the indifferent cabmen and say to them:
    

      "Why are you standing here? Why don't you revolt? You do believe in God,
      don't you? And you do know that this is a crime, and that people will go
      to Hell for this? Why do you keep quiet, then? True, the women are
      strangers to you, but they have fathers and brothers exactly the same as
      you...."
    

      Some friend of Vassiliev's once said of him that he was a man of talent.
      There is a talent for writing, for the theatre, for painting; but
      Vassiliev's was peculiar, a talent for humanity. He had a fine and noble
      flair for every kind of suffering. As a good actor reflects in
      himself the movement and voice of another, so Vassiliev could reflect in
      himself another's pain. Seeing tears, he wept. With a sick person, he
      himself became sick and moaned. If he saw violence done, it seemed to him
      that he was the victim. He was frightened like a child, and, frightened,
      ran for help. Another's pain roused him, excited him, threw him into a
      state of ecstasy....
    

      Whether the friend was right I do not know, but what happened to Vassiliev
      when it seemed to him that the question was solved was very much like an
      ecstasy. He sobbed, laughed, said aloud the things he would say to-morrow,
      felt a burning love for the men who would listen to him and stand by his
      side at the corner of the street, preaching. He sat down to write to them;
      he made vows.
    

      All this was the more like an ecstasy in that it did not last. Vassiliev
      was soon tired. The London women, the Hamburg women, those from Warsaw,
      crushed him with their mass, as the mountains crush the earth. He quailed
      before this mass; he lost himself; he remembered he had no gift for
      speaking, that he was timid and faint-hearted, that strange people would
      hardly want to listen to and understand him, a law-student in his third
      year, a frightened and insignificant figure. The true apostleship
      consisted, not only in preaching, but also in deeds....
    

      When daylight came and the carts rattled on the streets, Vassiliev lay
      motionless on the sofa, staring at one point. He did not think any more of
      women, or men, or apostles. All his attention was fixed on the pain of his
      soul which tormented him. It was a dull pain, indefinite, vague; it was
      like anguish and the most acute fear and despair. He could say where the
      pain was. It was in his breast, under the heart. It could not be compared
      to anything. Once on a time he used to have violent toothache. Once, he
      had pleurisy and neuralgia. But all these pains were as nothing beside the
      pain of his soul. Beneath this pain life seemed repulsive. The thesis, his
      brilliant work already written, the people he loved, the salvation of
      fallen women, all that which only yesterday he loved or was indifferent
      to, remembered now, irritated him in the same way as the noise of the
      carts, the running about of the porters and the daylight.... If someone
      now were to perform before his eyes a deed of mercy or an act of revolting
      violence, both would produce upon him an equally repulsive impression. Of
      all the thoughts which roved lazily in his head, two only did not irritate
      him: one—at any moment he had the power to kill himself, the other—that
      the pain would not last more than three days. The second he knew from
      experience.
    

      After having lain down for a while he got up and walked wringing his
      hands, not from corner to corner as usually, but in a square along the
      walls. He caught a glimpse of himself in the glass. His face was pale and
      haggard, his temples hollow, his eyes bigger, darker, more immobile, as if
      they were not his own, and they expressed the intolerable suffering of his
      soul.
    

      In the afternoon the painter knocked at the door.
    

      "Gregory, are you at home?" he asked.
    

      Receiving no answer, he stood musing for a while, and said to himself
      good-naturedly:
    

      "Out. He's gone to the University. Damn him."
    

      And went away.
    

      Vassiliev lay down on his bed and burying his head in the pillow he began
      to cry with the pain. But the faster his tears flowed, the more terrible
      was the pain. When it was dark, he got into his mind the idea of the
      horrible night which was awaiting him and awful despair seized him. He
      dressed quickly, ran out of his room, leaving the door wide open, and into
      the street without reason or purpose. Without asking himself where he was
      going, he walked quickly to Sadovaia Street.
    

      Snow was falling as yesterday. It was thawing. Putting his hands into his
      sleeves, shivering, and frightened of the noises and the bells of the
      trams and of passers-by, Vassiliev walked from Sadovaia to Sukhariev Tower
      then to the Red Gates, and from here he turned and went to Basmannaia. He
      went into a public-house and gulped down a big glass of vodka, but felt no
      better. Arriving at Razgoulyai, he turned to the right and began to stride
      down streets that he had never in his life been down before. He came to
      that old bridge under which the river Yaouza roars and from whence long
      rows of lights are seen in the windows of the Red Barracks. In order to
      distract the pain of his soul by a new sensation or another pain, not
      knowing what to do, weeping and trembling, Vassiliev unbuttoned his coat
      and jacket, baring his naked breast to the damp snow and the wind. Neither
      lessened the pain. Then he bent over the rail of the bridge and stared
      down at the black, turbulent Yaouza, and he suddenly wanted to throw
      himself head-first, not from hatred of life, not for the sake of suicide,
      but only to hurt himself and so to kill one pain by another. But the black
      water, the dark, deserted banks covered with snow were frightening. He
      shuddered and went on. He walked as far as the Red Barracks, then back and
      into a wood, from the wood to the bridge again.
    

      "No! Home, home," he thought. "At home I believe it's easier."
    

      And he went back. On returning home he tore off his wet clothes and hat,
      began to pace along the walls, and paced incessantly until the very
      morning.
    


      VII
    

      The next morning when the painter and the medico came to see him, they
      found him in a shirt torn to ribbons, his hands bitten all over, tossing
      about in the room and moaning with pain.
    

      "For God's sake!" he began to sob, seeing his comrades, "Take me anywhere
      you like, do what you like, but save me, for God's sake now, now! I'll
      kill myself."
    

      The painter went pale and was bewildered. The medico, too, nearly began to
      cry; but, believing that medical men must be cool and serious on every
      occasion of life, he said coldly:
    

      "It's a fit you've got. But never mind. Come to the doctor, at once."
    

      "Anywhere you like, but quickly, for God's sake!"
    

      "Don't be agitated. You must struggle with yourself."
    

      The painter and the medico dressed Vassiliev with trembling hands and led
      him into the street.
    

      "Mikhail Sergueyich has been wanting to make your acquaintance for a long
      while," the medico said on the way. "He's a very nice man, and knows his
      job splendidly. He took his degree in '82, and has got a huge practice
      already. He keeps friends with the students."
    

      "Quicker, quicker...." urged Vassiliev. Mikhail Sergueyich, a stout doctor
      with fair hair, received the friends politely, firmly, coldly, and smiled
      with one cheek only.
    

      "The painter and Mayer have told me of your disease already," he said.
      "Very glad to be of service to you. Well? Sit down, please."
    

      He made Vassiliev sit down in a big chair by the table, and put a box of
      cigarettes in front of him.
    

      "Well?" he began, stroking his knees. "Let's make a start. How old are
      you?"
    

      He put questions and the medico answered. He asked whether Vassiliev's
      father suffered from any peculiar diseases, if he had fits of drinking,
      was he distinguished by his severity or any other eccentricities. He asked
      the same questions about his grandfather, mother, sisters, and brothers.
      Having ascertained that his mother had a fine voice and occasionally
      appeared on the stage, he suddenly brightened up and asked:
    

      "Excuse me, but could you recall whether the theatre was not a passion
      with your mother?"
    

      About twenty minutes passed. Vassiliev was bored by the doctor stroking
      his knees and talking of the same thing all the while.
    

      "As far as I can understand your questions, Doctor," he said. "You want to
      know whether my disease is hereditary or not. It is not hereditary."
    

      The doctor went on to ask if Vassiliev had not any secret vices in his
      early youth, any blows on the head, any love passions, eccentricities, or
      exceptional infatuations. To half the questions habitually asked by
      careful doctors you may return no answer without any injury to your
      health; but Mikhail Sergueyich, the medico and the painter looked as
      though, if Vassiliev failed to answer even one single question, everything
      would be ruined. For some reason the doctor wrote down the answers he
      received on a scrap of paper. Discovering that Vassiliev had already
      passed through the faculty of natural science and was now in the Law
      faculty, the doctor began to be pensive....
    

      "He wrote a brilliant thesis last year...." said the medico.
    

      "Excuse me. You mustn't interrupt me; you prevent me from concentrating,"
      the doctor said, smiling with one cheek. "Yes, certainly that is important
      for the anamnesis.... Yes, yes.... And do you drink vodka?" he turned to
      Vassiliev.
    

      "Very rarely."
    

      Another twenty minutes passed. The medico began sotto voce to give
      his opinion of the immediate causes of the fit and told how he, the
      painter and Vassiliev went to S——v Street the day before
      yesterday.
    

      The indifferent, reserved, cold tone in which his friends and the doctor
      were speaking of the women and the miserable street seemed to him in the
      highest degree strange....
    

      "Doctor, tell me this one thing," he said, restraining himself from being
      rude. "Is prostitution an evil or not?"
    

      "My dear fellow, who disputes it?" the doctor said with an expression as
      though he had long ago solved all these questions for himself. "Who
      disputes it?"
    

      "Are you a psychiatrist?"
    

      "Yes-s, a psychiatrist."
    

      "Perhaps all of you are right," said Vassiliev, rising and beginning to
      walk from corner to corner. "It may be. But to me all this seems amazing.
      They see a great achievement in my having passed through two faculties at
      the university; they praise me to the skies because I have written a work
      that will be thrown away and forgotten in three years' time, but became I
      can't speak of prostitutes as indifferently as I can about these chairs,
      they send me to doctors, call me a lunatic, and pity me."
    

      For some reason Vassiliev suddenly began to feel an intolerable pity for
      himself, his friends, and everybody whom he had seen the day before
      yesterday, and for the doctor. He began to sob and fell into the chair.
    

      The friends looked interrogatively at the doctor. He, looking as though he
      magnificently understood the tears and the despair, and knew himself a
      specialist in this line, approached Vassiliev and gave him some drops to
      drink, and then when Vassiliev grew calm undressed him and began to
      examine the sensitiveness of his skin, of the knee reflexes....
    

      And Vassiliev felt better. When he was coming out of the doctor's he was
      already ashamed; the noise of the traffic did not seem irritating, and the
      heaviness beneath his heart became easier and easier as though it were
      thawing. In his hand were two prescriptions. One was for kali-bromatum,
      the other—morphia. He used to take both before.
    

      He stood still in the street for a while, pensive, and then, taking leave
      of his friends, lazily dragged on towards the university.
