AN INQUIRY
    

IT was midday.
      Voldyrev, a tall, thick-set country gentleman with a cropped head and
      prominent eyes, took off his overcoat, mopped his brow with his silk
      handkerchief, and somewhat diffidently went into the government office.
      There they were scratching away. . . .
    

      “Where can I make an inquiry here?” he said, addressing a
      porter who was bringing a trayful of glasses from the furthest recesses of
      the office. “I have to make an inquiry here and to take a copy of a
      resolution of the Council.”
    

      “That way please! To that one sitting near the window!” said
      the porter, indicating with the tray the furthest window. Voldyrev coughed
      and went towards the window; there, at a green table spotted like typhus,
      was sitting a young man with his hair standing up in four tufts on his
      head, with a long pimply nose, and a long faded uniform. He was writing,
      thrusting his long nose into the papers. A fly was walking about near his
      right nostril, and he was continually stretching out his lower lip and
      blowing under his nose, which gave his face an extremely care-worn
      expression.
    

      “May I make an inquiry about my case here . . . of you? My name is
      Voldyrev. And, by the way, I have to take a copy of the resolution of the
      Council of the second of March.”
    

      The clerk dipped his pen in the ink and looked to see if he had got too
      much on it. Having satisfied himself that the pen would not make a blot,
      he began scribbling away. His lip was thrust out, but it was no longer
      necessary to blow: the fly had settled on his ear.
    

      “Can I make an inquiry here?” Voldyrev repeated a minute
      later, “my name is Voldyrev, I am a landowner. . . .”
    

      “Ivan Alexeitch!” the clerk shouted into the air as though he
      had not observed Voldyrev, “will you tell the merchant Yalikov when
      he comes to sign the copy of the complaint lodged with the police! I’ve
      told him a thousand times!”
    

      “I have come in reference to my lawsuit with the heirs of Princess
      Gugulin,” muttered Voldyrev. “The case is well known. I
      earnestly beg you to attend to me.”
    

      Still failing to observe Voldyrev, the clerk caught the fly on his lip,
      looked at it attentively and flung it away. The country gentleman coughed
      and blew his nose loudly on his checked pocket handkerchief. But this was
      no use either. He was still unheard. The silence lasted for two minutes.
      Voldyrev took a rouble note from his pocket and laid it on an open book
      before the clerk. The clerk wrinkled up his forehead, drew the book
      towards him with an anxious air and closed it.
    

      “A little inquiry. . . . I want only to find out on what grounds the
      heirs of Princess Gugulin. . . . May I trouble you?”
    

      The clerk, absorbed in his own thoughts, got up and, scratching his elbow,
      went to a cupboard for something. Returning a minute later to his table he
      became absorbed in the book again: another rouble note was lying upon it.
    

      “I will trouble you for one minute only. . . . I have only to make
      an inquiry.”
    

      The clerk did not hear, he had begun copying something.
    

      Voldyrev frowned and looked hopelessly at the whole scribbling
      brotherhood.
    

      “They write!” he thought, sighing. “They write, the
      devil take them entirely!”
    

      He walked away from the table and stopped in the middle of the room, his
      hands hanging hopelessly at his sides. The porter, passing again with
      glasses, probably noticed the helpless expression of his face, for he went
      close up to him and asked him in a low voice:
    

      “Well? Have you inquired?”
    

      “I’ve inquired, but he wouldn’t speak to me.”
    

      “You give him three roubles,” whispered the porter.
    

      “I’ve given him two already.”
    

      “Give him another.”
    

      Voldyrev went back to the table and laid a green note on the open book.
    

      The clerk drew the book towards him again and began turning over the
      leaves, and all at once, as though by chance, lifted his eyes to Voldyrev.
      His nose began to shine, turned red, and wrinkled up in a grin.
    

      “Ah . . . what do you want?” he asked.
    

      “I want to make an inquiry in reference to my case. . . . My name is
      Voldyrev.”
    

      “With pleasure! The Gugulin case, isn’t it? Very good. What is
      it then exactly?”
    

      Voldyrev explained his business.
    

      The clerk became as lively as though he were whirled round by a hurricane.
      He gave the necessary information, arranged for a copy to be made, gave
      the petitioner a chair, and all in one instant. He even spoke about the
      weather and asked after the harvest. And when Voldyrev went away he
      accompanied him down the stairs, smiling affably and respectfully, and
      looking as though he were ready any minute to fall on his face before the
      gentleman. Voldyrev for some reason felt uncomfortable, and in obedience
      to some inward impulse he took a rouble out of his pocket and gave it to
      the clerk. And the latter kept bowing and smiling, and took the rouble
      like a conjuror, so that it seemed to flash through the air.
    

      “Well, what people!” thought the country gentleman as he went
      out into the street, and he stopped and mopped his brow with his
      handkerchief.
