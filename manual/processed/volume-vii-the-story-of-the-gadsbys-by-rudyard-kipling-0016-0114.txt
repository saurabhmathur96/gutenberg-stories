VOLUME VII THE STORY OF THE GADSBYS

  

  









 Preface

 To THE ADDRESS OF

 CAPTAIN J. MAFFLIN,

 Duke of Derry's (Pink) Hussars.

 DEAR MAFFLIN,—You will remember that I wrote this story as an Awful
      Warning. None the less you have seen fit to disregard it and have followed
      Gadsby's example—as I betted you would. I acknowledge that you paid
      the money at once, but you have prejudiced the mind of Mrs. Mafflin
      against myself, for though I am almost the only respectable friend of your
      bachelor days, she has been darwaza band to me throughout the season.
      Further, she caused you to invite me to dinner at the Club, where you
      called me “a wild ass of the desert,” and went home at half-past ten,
      after discoursing for twenty minutes on the responsibilities of
      housekeeping. You now drive a mail-phaeton and sit under a Church of
      England clergyman. I am not angry, Jack. It is your kismet, as it was
      Gaddy's, and his kismet who can avoid? Do not think that I am moved by a
      spirit of revenge as I write, thus publicly, that you and you alone are
      responsible for this book. In other and more expansive days, when you
      could look at a magnum without flushing and at a cheroot without turning
      white, you supplied me with most of the material. Take it back again—would
      that I could have preserved your fetterless speech in the telling—take
      it back, and by your slippered hearth read it to the late Miss Deercourt.
      She will not be any the more willing to receive my cards, but she will
      admire you immensely, and you, I feel sure, will love me. You may even
      invite me to another very bad dinner—at the Club, which, as you and
      your wife know, is a safe neutral ground for the entertainment of wild
      asses. Then, my very dear hypocrite, we shall be quits.

 Yours always,

 RUDYARD KIPLING.

 P. S.—On second thoughts I should recommend you to keep the book
      away from Mrs. Mafflin.

  

  









 POOR DEAR MAMMA

 The wild hawk to the wind-swept sky,
    The deer to the wholesome wold,
   And the heart of a man to the heart of a maid,
    As it was in the days of old.
                 —Gypsy Song.

 SCENE. Interior of Miss MINNIE THREEGAN'S Bedroom at Simla. Miss THREEGAN,
      in window-seat, turning over a drawerful of things. Miss EMMA DEERCOURT,
      bosom—friend, who has come to spend the day, sitting on the bed,
      manipulating the bodice of a ballroom frock, and a bunch of artificial
      lilies of the valley. Time, 5:30 P. M. on a hot May afternoon.

 Miss DEERCOURT. And he said: “I shall never forget this dance,” and, of
      course, I said: “Oh, how can you be so silly!” Do you think he meant
      anything, dear?

 Miss THREEGAN. (Extracting long lavender silk stocking from the rubbish.)
      You know him better than I do.

 Miss D. Oh, do be sympathetic, Minnie! I'm sure he does. At least I would
      be sure if he wasn't always riding with that odious Mrs. Hagan.

 Miss T. I suppose so. How does one manage to dance through one's heels
      first? Look at this—isn't it shameful? (Spreads stocking-heel on
      open hand for inspection.)

 Miss D. Never mind that! You can't mend it. Help me with this hateful
      bodice. I've run the string so, and I've run the string so, and I can't
      make the fulness come right. Where would you put this? (Waves lilies of
      the valley.)

 Miss T. As high up on the shoulder as possible.

 Miss D. Am I quite tall enough? I know it makes May Older look lopsided.

 Miss T. Yes, but May hasn't your shoulders. Hers are like a hock-bottle.

 BEARER. (Rapping at door.) Captain Sahib aya.

 Miss D. (Jumping up wildly, and hunting for bodice, which she has
      discarded owing to the heat of the day.) Captain Sahib! What Captain
      Sahib? Oh, good gracious, and I'm only half dressed! Well, I sha'n't
      bother.

 Miss T. (Calmly.) You needn't. It isn't for us. That's Captain Gadsby. He
      is going for a ride with Mamma. He generally comes five days out of the
      seven.

 AGONIZED VOICE. (Prom an inner apartment.) Minnie, run out and give
      Captain Gadsby some tea, and tell him I shall be ready in ten minutes;
      and, O Minnie, come to me an instant, there's a dear girl!

 Miss T. Oh, bother! (Aloud.) Very well, Mamma.

 Exit, and reappears, after five minutes, flushed, and rubbing her fingers.

 Miss D. You look pink. What has happened?

 Miss T. (In a stage whisper.) A twenty-four-inch waist, and she won't let
      it out. Where are my bangles? (Rummages on the toilet-table, and dabs at
      her hair with a brush in the interval.)

 Miss D. Who is this Captain Gadsby? I don't think I've met him.

 Miss T. You must have. He belongs to the Harrar set. I've danced with him,
      but I've never talked to him. He's a big yellow man, just like a
      newly-hatched chicken, with an enormous moustache. He walks like this
      (imitates Cavalry swagger), and he goes “Ha-Hmmm!” deep down in his throat
      when he can't think of anything to say. Mamma likes him. I don't.

 Miss D. (Abstractedly.) Does he wax that moustache?

 Miss T. (Busy with Powder-puff.) Yes, I think so. Why?

 Miss D. (Bending over the bodice and sewing furiously.) Oh, nothing—only—

 Miss T. (Sternly.) Only what? Out with it, Emma.

 Miss D. Well, May Olger—she's engaged to Mr. Charteris, you know—said—Promise
      you won't repeat this?

 Miss T. Yes, I promise. What did she say?

 Miss D. That—that being kissed (with a rush) with a man who didn't
      wax his moustache was—like eating an egg without salt.

 Miss T. (At her full height, with crushing scorn.) May Olger is a horrid,
      nasty Thing, and you can tell her I said so. I'm glad she doesn't belong
      to my set—I must go and feed this man! Do I look presentable?

 Miss D. Yes, perfectly. Be quick and hand him over to your Mother, and
      then we can talk. I shall listen at the door to hear what you say to him.

 Miss T. 'Sure I don't care. I'm not afraid of Captain Gadsby.

 In proof of this swings into the drawing-room with a mannish stride
      followed by two short steps, which produces the effect of a restive horse
      entering. Misses CAPTAIN GADSBY, who is sitting in the shadow of the
      window-curtain, and gazes round helplessly.

 CAPTAIN GADSBY. (Aside.) The filly, by Jove! 'Must ha' picked up that
      action from the sire. (Aloud, rising.) Good evening, Miss Threegan.

 Miss T. (Conscious that she is flushing.) Good evening, Captain Gadsby.
      Mamma told me to say that she will be ready in a few minutes. Won't you
      have some tea? (Aside.) I hope Mamma will be quick. What am I to say to
      the creature? (Aloud and abruptly.) Milk and sugar?

 Capt. G. No sugar, tha-anks, and very little milk. Ha-Hmmm.

 Miss T. (Aside.) If he's going to do that, I'm lost. I shall laugh. I know
      I shall!

 Capt. G. (Pulling at his moustache and watching it sideways down his
      nose.) Ha-Hmmm. (Aside.) 'Wonder what the little beast can talk about.
      'Must make a shot at it.

 Miss T. (Aside.) Oh, this is agonizing. I must say something.

 Both Together. Have you Been—

 Capt. G. I beg your pardon. You were going to say—

 Miss T. (Who has been watching the moustache with awed fascination.) Won't
      you have some eggs?

 Capt. G. (Looking bewilderedly at the tea-table.) Eggs! (Aside.) O Hades!
      She must have a nursery-tea at this hour. S'pose they've wiped her mouth
      and sent her to me while the Mother is getting on her duds. (Aloud.) No,
      thanks.

 Miss T. (Crimson with confusion.) Oh! I didn't mean that. I wasn't
      thinking of mou—eggs for an instant. I mean salt. Won't you have
      some sa—sweets? (Aside.) He'll think me a raving lunatic. I wish
      Mamma would come.

 Capt. G. (Aside.) It was a nursery-tea and she's ashamed of it. By Jove!
      She doesn't look half bad when she colors up like that. (Aloud, helping
      himself from the dish.) Have you seen those new chocolates at Peliti's?

 Miss T. No, I made these myself. What are they like?

 Capt. G. These! De-licious. (Aside.) And that's a fact.

 Miss T. (Aside.) Oh, bother! he'll think I'm fishing for compliments.
      (Aloud.) No, Peliti's of course.

 Capt. G. (Enthusiastically.) Not to compare with these. How d'you make
      them? I can't get my khansamah to understand the simplest thing beyond
      mutton and fowl.

 Miss T. Yes? I'm not a khansamah, you know. Perhaps you frighten him. You
      should never frighten a servant. He loses his head. It's very bad policy.

 Capt. G. He's so awf'ly stupid.

 Miss T. (Folding her hands in her lap.) You should call him quietly and
      say: 'O khansamah jee!'

 Capt. G. (Getting interested.) Yes? (Aside.) Fancy that little
      featherweight saying, 'O khansamah jee' to my bloodthirsty Mir Khan!

 Miss T Then you should explain the dinner, dish by dish.

 Capt. G. But I can't speak the vernacular.

 Miss T. (Patronizingly.) You should pass the Higher Standard and try.

 Capt. G. I have, but I don't seem to be any the wiser. Are you?

 Miss T. I never passed the Higher Standard. But the khansamah is very
      patient with me. He doesn't get angry when I talk about sheep's topees, or
      order maunds of grain when I mean seers.

 Capt. G. (Aside with intense indignation.) I'd like to see Mir Khan being
      rude to that girl! Hullo! Steady the Buffs! (Aloud.) And do you understand
      about horses, too?

 Miss T. A little—not very much. I can't doctor them, but I know what
      they ought to eat, and I am in charge of our stable.

 Capt. G. Indeed! You might help me then. What ought a man to give his sais
      in the Hills? My ruffian says eight rupees, because everything is so dear.

 Miss T. Six rupees a month, and one rupee Simla allowance—neither
      more nor less. And a grass-cut gets six rupees. That's better than buying
      grass in the bazar.

 Capt. G. (Admiringly.) How do you know?

 Miss T. I have tried both ways.

 Capt. G. Do you ride much, then? I've never seen you on the Mall.

 Miss T. (Aside.) I haven't passed him more than fifty times. (Aloud.)
      Nearly every day.

 Capt. G. By Jove! I didn't know that. Ha-Hmmm (Pulls at his moustache and
      is silent for forty seconds.)

 Miss T. (Desperately, and wondering what will happen next.) It looks
      beautiful. I shouldn't touch it if I were you. (Aside.) It's all Mamma's
      fault for not coming before. I will be rude!

 Capt. G. (Bronzing under the tan and bringing down his hand very quickly.)
      Eh! Wha-at! Oh, yes! Ha! Ha! (Laughs uneasily.) (Aside.) Well, of all the
      dashed cheek! I never had a woman say that to me yet. She must be a cool
      hand or else—Ah! that nursery-tea!

 VOICE PROM THE UNKNOWN. Tchk! Tchk! Tchk!

 Capt. G. Good gracious! What's that?

 Miss T. The dog, I think. (Aside.) Emma has been listening, and I'll never
      forgive her!

 Capt. G. (Aside.) They don't keep dogs here. (Aloud.) Didn't sound like a
      dog, did it?

 Miss T. Then it must have been the cat. Let's go into the veranda. What a
      lovely evening it is!

 Steps into veranda and looks out across the hills into sunset. The CAPTAIN
      follows.

 Capt. G. (Aside.) Superb eyes! I wonder that I never noticed them before!
      (Aloud.) There's going to be a dance at Viceregal Lodge on Wednesday. Can
      you spare me one?

 Miss T. (Shortly.) No! I don't want any of your charity-dances. You only
      ask me because Mamma told you to. I hop and I bump. You know I do!

 Capt. G. (Aside.) That's true, but little girls shouldn't understand these
      things. (Aloud.) No, on my word, I don't. You dance beautifully.

 Miss T. Then why do you always stand out after half a dozen turns? I
      thought officers in the Army didn't tell fibs.

 Capt. G. It wasn't a fib, believe me. I really do want the pleasure of a
      dance with you.

 Miss T. (Wickedly.) Why? Won't Mamma dance with you any more?

 Capt. G. (More earnestly than the necessity demands.) I wasn't thinking of
      your Mother. (Aside.) You little vixen!

 Miss T. (Still looking out of the window.) Eh? Oh, I beg your pardon. I
      was thinking of something else.

 Capt. G. (Aside.) Well! I wonder what she'll say next. I've never known a
      woman treat me like this before. I might b—Dash it, I might be an
      Infantry subaltern! (Aloud.) Oh, please don't trouble. I'm not worth
      thinking about. Isn't your Mother ready yet?

 Miss T. I should think so; but promise me, Captain Gamsby, you won't take
      poor dear Mamma twice round Jakko any more. It tires her so.

 Capt. G. She says that no exercise tires her.

 Miss T. Yes, but she suffers afterward. You don't know what rheumatism is,
      and you oughtn't to keep her out so late, when it gets chill in the
      evenings.

 Capt. G. (Aside.) Rheumatism. I thought she came off her horse rather in a
      bunch. Whew! One lives and learns. (Aloud.) I'm sorry to hear that. She
      hasn't mentioned it to me.

 Miss T. (Flurried.) Of course not! Poor dear Mamma never would. And you
      mustn't say that I told you either. Promise me that you won't. Oh, Captain
      Gamsby, promise me you won't!

 Capt. G. I am dumb, or—I shall be as soon as you've given me that
      dance, and another—if you can trouble yourself to think about me for
      a minute.

 Miss T. But you won't like it one little bit. You'll be awfully sorry
      afterward.

 Capt. G. I shall like it above all things, and I shall only be sorry that
      I didn't get more. (Aside.) Now what in the world am I saying?

 Miss T. Very well. You will have only yourself to thank if your toes are
      trodden on. Shall we say Seven?

 Capt. G. And Eleven. (Aside.) She can't be more than eight stone, but,
      even then, it's an absurdly small foot. (Looks at his own riding boots.)

 Miss T. They're beautifully shiny. I can almost see my face in them.

 Capt. G. I was thinking whether I should have to go on crutches for the
      rest of my life if you trod on my toes.

 Miss T. Very likely. Why not change Eleven for a square?

 Capt. G. No, please! I want them both waltzes. Won't you write them down?

 Miss T. I don't get so many dances that I shall confuse them. You will be
      the offender.

 Capt. G. Wait and see! (Aside.) She doesn't dance perfectly, perhaps, but—

 Miss T. Your tea must have got cold by this time. Won't you have another
      cup?

 Capt. G. No, thanks. Don't you think it's pleasanter out in the veranda?
      (Aside.) I never saw hair take that color in the sunshine before. (Aloud.)
      It's like one of Dicksee's pictures.

 Miss T. Yes I It's a wonderful sunset, isn't it? (Bluntly.) But what do
      you know about Dicksee's pictures?

 Capt. G. I go Home occasionally. And I used to know the Galleries.
      (Nervously.) You mustn't think me only a Philistine with a moustache.

 Miss T. Don't! Please don't. I'm so sorry for what I said then. I was
      horribly rude. It slipped out before j thought. Don't you know the
      temptation to say frightful and shocking things just for the mere sake of
      saying them? I'm afraid I gave way to it.

 Capt. G. (Watching the girl as she flushes.) I think I know the feeling.
      It would be terrible if we all yielded to it, wouldn't it? For instance, I
      might say—

 POOR DEAR MAMMA. (Entering, habited, hatted, and booted.) Ah, Captain
      Gamsby? 'Sorry to keep you waiting. 'Hope you haven't been bored. 'My
      little girl been talking to you?

 Miss T. (Aside.) I'm not sorry I spoke about the rheumatism. I'm not! I'm
      NOT! I only wished I'd mentioned the corns too.

 Capt. G. (Aside.) What a shame! I wonder how old she is. It never occurred
      to me before. (Aloud.) We've been discussing 'Shakespeare and the musical
      glasses' in the veranda.

 Miss T. (Aside.) Nice man! He knows that quotation. He isn't a Philistine
      with a moustache. (Aloud.) Goodbye, Captain Gadsby. (Aside.) What a huge
      hand and what a squeeze! I don't suppose he meant it, but he has driven
      the rings into my fingers.

 Poor Dear Mamma. Has Vermillion come round yet? Oh, yes! Captain Gadsby,
      don't you think that the saddle is too far forward? (They pass into the
      front veranda.)

 Capt. G. (Aside.) How the dickens should I know what she prefers? She told
      me that she doted on horses. (Aloud.) I think it is.

 Miss T. (Coming out into front veranda.) Oh! Bad Buldoo! I must speak to
      him for this. He has taken up the curb two links, and Vermillion bates
      that. (Passes out and to horse's head.)

 Capt. G. Let me do it!

 Miss. T. No, Vermillion understands me. Don't you, old man? (Loosens
      curb-chain skilfully, and pats horse on nose and throttle.) Poor
      Vermillion! Did they want to cut his chin off? There!

 Captain Gadsby watches the interlude with undisguised admiration.

 Poor Dear Mamma. (Tartly to Miss T.) You've forgotten your guest, I think,
      dear.

 Miss T. Good gracious! So I have! Goodbye. (Retreats indoors hastily.)

 Poor Dear Mamma. (Bunching reins in fingers hampered by too tight
      gauntlets.) CAPTAIN Gadsby!

 CAPTAIN GADSBY stoops and makes the foot-rest. Poor Dear Mamma blunders,
      halts too long, and breaks through it.

 Capt. G. (Aside.) Can't hold up seven stone forever. It's all your
      rheumatism. (Aloud.) Can't imagine why I was so clumsy. (Aside.) Now
      Little Featherweight would have gone up like a bird.

 They ride out of the garden. The Captain falls back.

 Capt. G. (Aside.) How that habit catches her under the arms! Ugh!

 Poor Dear Mamma. (With the worn smile of sixteen seasons, the worse for
      exchange.) You're dull this afternoon, Captain Gadsby.

 Capt. G. (Spurring up wearily.) Why did you keep me waiting so long?

 Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

 (AN INTERVAL OF THREE WEEKS.)

 GILDED YOUTH. (Sitting on railings opposite Town Hall.) Hullo, Gadsby!
      'Been trotting out the Gorgonzola! We all thought it was the Gorgon you're
      mashing.

 Capt. G. (With withering emphasis.) You young cub! What the—does it
      matter to you?

 Proceeds to read GILDED YOUTH a lecture on discretion and deportment,
      which crumbles latter like a Chinese Lantern. Departs fuming.

 (FURTHER INTERVAL OF FIVE WEEKS.) SCENE. Exterior of New Simla Library on
      a foggy evening. Miss THREEGAN and Miss DEERCOURT meet among the
      'rickshaws. Miss T. is carrying a bundle of books under her left arm.

 Miss D. (Level intonation.) Well?

 Miss T. (Ascending intonation.) Well?

 Miss D. (Capturing her friend's left arm, taking away all the books,
      placing books in 'rickshaw, returning to arm, securing hand by third
      finger and investigating.) Well! You bad girl! And you never told me.

 Miss T. (Demurely.) He—he—he only spoke yesterday afternoon.

 Miss D. Bless you, dear! And I'm to be bridesmaid, aren't I? You know you
      promised ever so long ago.

 Miss T. Of course. I'll tell you all about it tomorrow. (Gets into
      'rickshaw.) O Emma!

 Miss D. (With intense interest.) Yes, dear?

 Miss T. (Piano.) It's quite true—about-the-egg.

 Miss D. What egg?

 Miss T. (Pianissimo prestissimo.) The egg without the salt. (Forte.) Chalo
      ghar ko jaldi, jhampani! (Go home, jhampani.)

 THE WORLD WITHOUT

 Certain people of importance.

 SCENE. Smoking-room of the Degchi Club. Time, 10.30 P. M. of a stuffy
      night in the Rains. Four men dispersed in picturesque attitudes and
      easy-chairs. To these enter BLAYNE of the Irregular Moguls, in evening
      dress.

 BLAYNE. Phew! The Judge ought to be hanged in his own store-godown. Hi,
      khitmatgar! Pour a whiskey-peg, to take the taste out of my mouth.

 CURTISS. (Royal Artillery.) That's it, is it? What the deuce made you dine
      at the Judge's? You know his bandobust.

 Blayne. 'Thought it couldn't be worse than the Club, but I'll swear he
      buys ullaged liquor and doctors it with gin and ink (looking round the
      room.) Is this all of you tonight?

 DOONE. (P.W.D.) Anthony was called out at dinner. Mingle had a pain in his
      tummy.

 Curtiss. Miggy dies of cholera once a week in the Rains, and gets drunk on
      chlorodyne in between. Good little chap, though. Any one at the Judge's,
      Blayne?

 Blayne. Cockley and his memsahib looking awfully white and fagged. Female
      girl—couldn'tcatch the name—on her way to the Hills, under the
      Cockleys' charge—the Judge, and Markyn fresh from Simla—disgustingly
      fit.

 Curtiss. Good Lord, how truly magnificent! Was there enough ice? When I
      mangled garbage there I got one whole lump—nearly as big as a
      walnut. What had Markyn to say for himself?

 Blayne. Seems that every one is having a fairly good time up there in
      spite of the rain. By Jove, that reminds me! I know I hadn'tcome across
      just for the pleasure of your society. News! Great news! Markyn told me.

 DOONE. Who's dead now?

 Blayne. No one that I know of; but Gadsby's hooked at last!

 DROPPING CHORUS. How much? The Devil! Markyn was pulling your leg. Not
      GADSBY!

 Blayne. (Humming.) “Yea, verily, verily, verily! Verily, verily, I say
      unto thee.” Theodore, the gift 'o God! Our Phillup! It's been given out up
      above.

 MACKESY. (Barrister-at-Law.) Huh! Women will give out anything. What does
      accused say?

 Blayne. Markyn told me that he congratulated him warily—one hand
      held out, t'other ready to guard. Gadsby turned pink and said it was so.

 Curtiss. Poor old Caddy! They all do it. Who's she? Let's hear the
      details.

 Blayne. She's a girl—daughter of a Colonel Somebody.

 Doone. Simla's stiff with Colonels' daughters. Be more explicit.

 Blayne. Wait a shake. What was her name? Thresomething. Three—

 Curtiss. Stars, perhaps. Caddy knows that brand.

 Blayne. Threegan—Minnie Threegan.

 Mackesy. Threegan Isn't she a little bit of a girl with red hair?

 Blayne. 'Bout that—from what from what Markyn said.

 Mackesy. Then I've met her. She was at Lucknow last season. 'Owned a
      permanently juvenile Mamma, and danced damnably. I say, Jervoise, you knew
      the Threegans, didn't you?

 JERVOISE. (Civilian of twenty-five years' service, waking up from his
      doze.) Eh? What's that? Knew who? How? I thought I was at Home, confound
      you!

 Mackesy. The Threegan girl's engaged, so Blayne says.

 Jervoise. (Slowly.) Engaged—en-gaged! Bless my soul! I'm getting an
      old man! Little Minnie Threegan engaged. It was only the other day I went
      home with them in the Surat—no, the Massilia—and she was
      crawling about on her hands and knees among the ayahs. 'Used to call me
      the “Tick Tack Sahib” because I showed her my watch. And that was in
      Sixty-Seven—no, Seventy. Good God, how time flies! I'm an old man. I
      remember when Threegan married Miss Derwent—daughter of old Hooky
      Derwent—but that was before your time. And so the little baby's
      engaged to have a little baby of her own! Who's the other fool?

 Mackesy. Gadsby of the Pink Hussars.

 Jervoise. 'Never met him. Threegan lived in debt, married in debt, and'll
      die in debt. 'Must be glad to get the girl off his hands.

 Blayne. Caddy has money—lucky devil. Place at Home, too.

 Doone. He comes of first-class stock. 'Can't quite understand his being
      caught by a Colonel's daughter, and (looking cautiously round room.) Black
      Infantry at that! No offence to you, Blayne.

 Blayne. (Stiffly.) Not much, thaanks.

 Curtiss. (Quoting motto of Irregular Moguls.) “We are what we are,” eh,
      old man? But Gadsby was such a superior animal as a rule. Why didn't he go
      Home and pick his wife there?

 Mackesy. They are all alike when they come to the turn into the straight.
      About thirty a man begins to get sick of living alone.

 Curtiss. And of the eternal mutton—chop in the morning.

 Doone. It's a dead goat as a rule, but go on, Mackesy.

 Mackesy. If a man's once taken that way nothing will hold him, Do you
      remember Benoit of your service, Doone? They transferred him to Tharanda
      when his time came, and he married a platelayer's daughter, or something
      of that kind. She was the only female about the place.

 Doone. Yes, poor brute. That smashed Benoit's chances of promotion
      altogether. Mrs. Benoit used to ask “Was you goin' to the dance this
      evenin'?”

 Curtiss. Hang it all! Gadsby hasn't married beneath him. There's no
      tar-brush in the family, I suppose.

 Jervoise. Tar-brush! Not an anna. You young fellows talk as though the man
      was doing the girl an honor in marrying her. You're all too conceited—nothing's
      good enough for you.

 Blayne. Not even an empty Club, a dam' bad dinner at the Judge's, and a
      Station as sickly as a hospital. You're quite right. We're a set of
      Sybarites.

 Doone. Luxurious dogs, wallowing in—

 Curtiss. Prickly heat between the shoulders. I'm covered with it. Let's
      hope Beora will be cooler.

 Blayne. Whew! Are you ordered into camp, too? I thought the Gunners had a
      clean sheet.

 Curtiss. No, worse luck. Two cases yesterday—one died—and if
      we have a third, out we go. Is there any shooting at Beora, Doone?

 Doone. The country's under water, except the patch by the Grand Trunk
      Road. I was there yesterday, looking at a bund, and came across four poor
      devils in their last stage. It's rather bad from here to Kuchara.

 Curtiss. Then we're pretty certain to have a heavy go of it. Heigho! I
      shouldn't mind changing places with Gaddy for a while. 'Sport with
      Amaryllis in the shade of the Town Hall, and all that. Oh, why doesn't
      somebody come and marry me, instead of letting me go into cholera-camp?

 Mackesy. Ask the Committee.

 Curtiss. You ruffian! You'll stand me another peg for that. Blayne, what
      will you take? Mackesy is fine on moral grounds. Done, have you any
      preference?

 Doone. Small glass Kummel, please. Excellent carminative, these days.
      Anthony told me so.

 Mackesy. (Signing voucher for four drinks.) Most unfair punishment. I only
      thought of Curtiss as Actaeon being chivied round the billiard tables by
      the nymphs of Diana.

 Blayne. Curtiss would have to import his nymphs by train. Mrs. Cockley's
      the only woman in the Station. She won't leave Cockley, and he's doing his
      best to get her to go.

 Curtiss. Good, indeed! Here's Mrs. Cockley's health. To the only wife in
      the Station and a damned brave woman!

 OMNES. (Drinking.) A damned brave woman

 Blayne. I suppose Gadsby will bring his wife here at the end of the cold
      weather. They are going to be married almost immediately, I believe.

 Curtiss. Gadsby may thank his luck that the Pink Hussars are all
      detachment and no headquarters this hot weather, or he'd be torn from the
      arms of his love as sure as death. Have you ever noticed the
      thorough-minded way British Cavalry take to cholera? It's because they are
      so expensive. If the Pinks had stood fast here, they would have been out
      in camp a month ago. Yes, I should decidedly like to be Gadsby.

 Mackesy. He'll go Home after he's married, and send in his papers—see
      if he doesn't.

 Blayne. Why shouldn't he? Hasn't he money? Would any one of us be here if
      we weren't paupers?

 Doone. Poor old pauper! What has become of the six hundred you rooked from
      our table last month?

 Blayne. It took unto itself wings. I think an enterprising tradesman got
      some of it, and a shroff gobbled the rest—or else I spent it.

 Curtiss. Gadsby never had dealings with a shroff in his life.

 Doone. Virtuous Gadsby! If I had three thousand a month, paid from
      England, I don't think I'd deal with a shroff either.

 Mackesy. (Yawning.) Oh, it's a sweet life! I wonder whether matrimony
      would make it sweeter.

 Curtiss. Ask Cockley—with his wife dying by inches!

 Blayne. Go home and get a fool of a girl to come out to—what is it
      Thackeray says?—“the splendid palace of an Indian pro-consul.”

 Doone. Which reminds me. My quarters leak like a sieve. I had fever last
      night from sleeping in a swamp. And the worst of it is, one can't do
      anything to a roof till the Rains are over.

 Curtiss. What's wrong with you? You haven't eighty rotting Tommies to take
      into a running stream.

 Doone. No: but I'm mixed boils and bad language. I'm a regular Job all
      over my body. It's sheer poverty of blood, and I don't see any chance of
      getting richer—either way.

 Blayne. Can't you take leave?

 Doone. That's the pull you Army men have over us. Ten days are nothing in
      your sight. I'm so important that Government can't find a substitute if I
      go away. Ye-es, I'd like to be Gadsby, whoever his wife may be.

 Curtiss. You've passed the turn of life that Mackesy was speaking of.

 Doone. Indeed I have, but I never yet had the brutality to ask a woman to
      share my life out here.

 Blayne. On my soul I believe you're right. I'm thinking of Mrs. Cockley.
      The woman's an absolute wreck.

 Doone. Exactly. Because she stays down here. The only way to keep her fit
      would be to send her to the Hills for eight months—and the same with
      any woman. I fancy I see myself taking a wife on those terms.

 Mackesy. With the rupee at one and sixpence. The little Doones would be
      little Debra Doones, with a fine Mussoorie @chi-chi anent to bring home
      for the holidays.

 Curtiss. And a pair of be-ewtiful sambhur—horns for Doone to wear,
      free of expense, presented by—Doone. Yes, it's an enchanting
      prospect. By the way, the rupee hasn't done falling yet. The time will
      come when we shall think ourselves lucky if we only lose half our pay.

 Curtiss. Surely a third's loss enough. Who gains by the arrangement?
      That's what I want to know.

 Blayne. The Silver Question! I'm going to bed if you begin squabbling
      Thank Goodness, here's Anthony—looking like a ghost.

 Enter ANTHONY, Indian Medical Staff, very white and tired.

 Anthony. 'Evening, Blayne. It's raining in sheets. Whiskey peg lao,
      khitmatgar. The roads are something ghastly.

 Curtiss. How's Mingle?

 Anthony. Very bad, and more frightened. I handed him over to Fewton.
      Mingle might just as well have called him in the first place, instead of
      bothering me.

 Blayne. He's a nervous little chap. What has he got, this time?

 Anthony. 'Can't quite say. A very bad tummy and a blue funk so far. He
      asked me at once if it was cholera, and I told him not to be a fool. That
      soothed him.

 Curtiss. Poor devil! The funk does half the business in a man of that
      build.

 Anthony. (Lighting a cheroot.) I firmly believe the funk will kill him if
      he stays down. You know the amount of trouble he's been giving Fewton for
      the last three weeks. He's doing his very best to frighten himself into
      the grave.

 GENERAL CHORUS. Poor little devil! Why doesn't he get away?

 Anthony. 'Can't. He has his leave all right, but he's so dipped he can't
      take it, and I don't think his name on paper would raise four annas.
      That's in confidence, though.

 Mackesy. All the Station knows it.

 Anthony. “I suppose I shall have to die here,” he said, squirming all
      across the bed. He's quite made up his mind to Kingdom Come. And I know he
      has nothing more than a wet-weather tummy if he could only keep a hand on
      himself.

 Blayne. That's bad. That's very bad. Poor little Miggy. Good little chap,
      too. I say—

 Anthony. What do you say?

 Blayne. Well, look here—anyhow. If it's like that—as you say—I
      say fifty.

 Curtiss. I say fifty.

 Mackesy. I go twenty better.

 Doone. Bloated Croesus of the Bar! I say fifty. Jervoise, what do you say?
      Hi! Wake up!

 Jervoise. Eh? What's that? What's that?

 Curtiss. We want a hundred rupees from you. You're a bachelor drawing a
      gigantic income, and there's a man in a hole.

 Jervoise. What man? Any one dead?

 Blayne. No, but he'll die if you don't—give the hundred. Here!
      Here's a peg-voucher. You can see what we've signed for, and Anthony's man
      will come round tomorrow to collect it. So there will be no trouble.

 Jervoise. (Signing.) One hundred, E. M. J. There you are (feebly). It
      isn't one of your jokes, is it?

 Blayne. No, it really is wanted. Anthony, you were the biggest
      poker-winner last week, and you've defrauded the tax-collector too long.
      Sign!

 Anthony. Let's see. Three fifties and a seventy-two twenty-three twenty—say
      four hundred and twenty. That'll give him a month clear at the Hills. Many
      thanks, you men. I'll send round the chaprassi tomorrow.

 Curtiss. You must engineer his taking the stuff, and of course you mustn't—

 Anthony. Of course. It would never do. He'd weep with gratitude over his
      evening drink.

 Blayne. That's just what he would do, damn him. Oh! I say, Anthony, you
      pretend to know everything. Have you heard about Gadsby?

 Anthony. No. Divorce Court at last?

 Blayne. Worse. He's engaged!

 Anthony. How much? He can't be!

 Blayne. He is. He's going to be married in a few weeks. Markyn told me at
      the Judge's this evening. It's pukka.

 Anthony. You don't say so? Holy Moses! There'll be a shine in the tents of
      Kedar.

 Curtiss. 'Regiment cut up rough, think you?

 Anthony. 'Don't know anything about the Regiment.

 Mackesy. It is bigamy, then?

 Anthony. Maybe. Do you mean to say that you men have forgotten, or is
      there more charity in the world than I thought?

 Doone. You don't look pretty when you are trying to keep a secret. You
      bloat. Explain.

 Anthony. Mrs. Herriott!

 Blayne. (After a long pause, to the room generally.) It's my notion that
      we are a set of fools.

 Mackesy. Nonsense. That business was knocked on the head last season. Why,
      young Mallard—

 Anthony. Mallard was a candlestick, paraded as such. Think awhile.
      Recollect last season and the talk then. Mallard or no Mallard, did Gadsby
      ever talk to any other woman?

 Curtiss. There's something in that. It was slightly noticeable now you
      come to mention it. But she's at Naini Tal and he's at Simla.

 Anthony. He had to go to Simla to look after a globe-trotter relative of
      his—a person with a title. Uncle or aunt.

 Blayne And there he got engaged. No law prevents a man growing tired of a
      woman.

 Anthony. Except that he mustn't do it till the woman is tired of him. And
      the Herriott woman was not that.

 Curtiss. She may be now. Two months of Naini Tal works wonders.

 Doone. Curious thing how some women carry a Fate with them. There was a
      Mrs. Deegie in the Central Provinces whose men invariably fell away and
      got married. It became a regular proverb with us when I was down there. I
      remember three men desperately devoted to her, and they all, one after
      another, took wives.

 Curtiss. That's odd. Now I should have thought that Mrs. Deegie's
      influence would have led them to take other men's wives. It ought to have
      made them afraid of the judgment of Providence.

 Anthony. Mrs. Herriott will make Gadsby afraid of something more than the
      judgment of Providence, I fancy.

 Blayne. Supposing things are as you say, he'll be a fool to face her.
      He'll sit tight at Simla.

 Anthony. Shouldn't be a bit surprised if he went off to Naini to explain.
      He's an unaccountable sort of man, and she's likely to be a more than
      unaccountable woman.

 Doone. What makes you take her character away so confidently?

 Anthony. Primum tempus. Caddy was her first and a woman doesn't allow her
      first man to drop away without expostulation. She justifies the first
      transfer of affection to herself by swearing that it is forever and ever.
      Consequently—

 Blayne. Consequently, we are sitting here till past one o'clock, talking
      scandal like a set of Station cats. Anthony, it's all your fault. We were
      perfectly respectable till you came in. Go to bed. I'm off, Good night
      all.

 Curtiss. Past one! It's past two by Jove, and here's the khit coming for
      the late charge. Just Heavens! One, two, three, four, five rupees to pay
      for the pleasure of saying that a poor little beast of a woman is no
      better than she should be. I'm ashamed of myself. Go to bed, you
      slanderous villains, and if I'm sent to Beora tomorrow, be prepared to
      hear I'm dead before paying my card account!

  

  









 THE TENTS OF KEDAR

 Only why should it be with pain at all?
    Why must I 'twixt the leaves of coronal
    Put any kiss of pardon on thy brow?
    Why should the other women know so much,
    And talk together—
    Such the look and such
    The smile he used to love with, then as now.

    —Any Wife to any Husband.

 SCENE. A Naini Tal dinner for thirty-four. Plate, wines, crockery, and
      khitmatgars carefully calculated to scale of Rs. 6000 per mensem, less
      Exchange. Table split lengthways by bank of flowers.

 MRS. HERRIOTT. (After conversation has risen to proper pitch.) Ah! 'Didn't
      see you in the crush in the drawing-room. (Sotto voce.) Where have you
      been all this while, Pip?

 CAPTAIN GADSBY. (Turning from regularly ordained dinner partner and
      settling hock glasses.) Good evening. (Sotto voce.) Not quite so loud
      another time. You've no notion how your voice carries. (Aside.) So much
      for shirking the written explanation. It'll have to be a verbal one now.
      Sweet prospect! How on earth am I to tell her that I am a respectable,
      engaged member of society and it's all over between us?

 MRS. H. I've a heavy score against you. Where were you at the Monday Pop?
      Where were you on Tuesday? Where were you at the Lamonts' tennis? I was
      looking everywhere.

 Capt. G. For me! Oh, I was alive somewhere, I suppose. (Aside.) It's for
      Minnie's sake, but it's going to be dashed unpleasant.

 Mrs. H. Have I done anything to offend you? I never meant it if I have. I
      couldn't help going for a ride with the Vaynor man. It was promised a week
      before you came up.

 Capt. G. I didn't know—

 Mrs. H. It really was.

 Capt. G. Anything about it, I mean.

 Mrs. H. What has upset you today? All these days? You haven't been near me
      for four whole days—nearly one hundred hours. Was it kind of you,
      Pip? And I've been looking forward so much to your coming.

 Capt. G. Have you?

 Mrs. H. You know I have! I've been as foolish as a schoolgirl about it. I
      made a little calendar and put it in my card-case, and every time the
      twelve o'clock gun went off I scratched out a square and said: “That
      brings me nearer to Pip. My Pip!”

 Capt. G. (With an uneasy laugh). What will Mackler think if you neglect
      him so?

 Mrs. H. And it hasn't brought you nearer. You seem farther away than ever.
      Are you sulking about something? I know your temper.

 Capt. G. No.

 Mrs. H. Have I grown old in the last few months, then? (Reaches forward to
      bank of flowers for menu-card.)

 PARTNER ON LEFT. Allow me. (Hands menu-card. Mrs. H. keeps her arm at full
      stretch for three seconds.)

 Mrs. H. (To partner.) Oh, thanks. I didn't see. (Turns right again.) Is
      anything in me changed at all?

 Capt. G. For Goodness's sake go on with your dinner! You must eat
      something. Try one of those cutlet arrangements. (Aside.) And I fancied
      she had good shoulders, once upon a time! What an ass a man can make of
      himself!

 Mrs. H. (Helping herself to a paper frill, seven peas, some stamped
      carrots and a spoonful of gravy.) That isn't an answer. Tell me whether I
      have done anything.

 Capt. G. (Aside.) If it isn't ended here there will be a ghastly scene
      some-where else. If only I'd written to her and stood the racket at long
      range! (To Khitmatgar.) Han! Simpkin do. (Aloud.) I'll tell you later on.

 Mrs. H. Tell me now. It must be some foolish misunderstanding, and you
      know that there was to be nothing of that sort between us. We, of all
      people in the world, can't afford it. Is it the Vaynor man, and don't you
      like to say so? On my honor—

 Capt. G. I haven't given the Vaynor man a thought.

 Mrs. H. But how d'you know that I haven't?

 Capt. G. (Aside.) Here's my chance and may the Devil help me through with
      it. (Aloud and measuredly.) Believe me, I do not care how often or how
      tenderly you think of the Vaynor man.

 Mrs. H. I wonder if you mean that! Oh, what is the good of squabbling and
      pretending to misunderstand when you are only up for so short a time? Pip,
      don't be a stupid!

 Follows a pause, during which he crosses his left leg over his right and
      continues his dinner.

 Capt. G. (In answer to the thunderstorm in her eyes.) Corns—my
      worst.

 Mrs. H. Upon my word, you are the very rudest man in the world! I'll never
      do it again.

 Capt. G. (Aside.) No, I don't think you will; but I wonder what you will
      do before it's all over. (To Khitmatgar.) Thorah ur Simpkin do.

 Mrs. H. Well! Haven't you the grace to apologize, bad man?

 Capt. G. (Aside.) I mustn't let it drift back now. Trust a woman for being
      as blind as a bat when she won't see.

 Mrs. H. I'm waiting; or would you like me to dictate a form of apology?

 Capt. G. (Desperately.) By all means dictate.

 Mrs. H. (Lightly.) Very well. Rehearse your several Christian names after
      me and go on: “Profess my sincere repentance.”

 Capt. G. “Sincere repentance.”

 Mrs. H. “For having behaved”—

 Capt. G. (Aside.) At last! I wish to Goodness she'd look away. “For having
      behaved”—as I have behaved, and declare that I am thoroughly and
      heartily sick of the whole business, and take this opportunity of making
      clear my intention of ending it, now, henceforward, and forever. (Aside.)
      If any one had told me I should be such a blackguard!—

 Mrs. H. (Shaking a spoonful of potato chips into her plate.) That's not a
      pretty joke.

 Capt. G. No. It's a reality. (Aside.) I wonder if smashes of this kind are
      always so raw.

 Mrs. H. Really, Pip, you're getting more absurd every day.

 Capt. G. I don't think you quite understand me. Shall I repeat it?

 Mrs. H. No! For pity's sake don't do that. It's too terrible, even in fur.

 Capt. G. I'll let her think it over for a while. But I ought to be
      horsewhipped.

 Mrs. H. I want to know what you meant by what you said just now.

 Capt. G. Exactly what I said. No less.

 Mrs. H. But what have I done to deserve it? What have I done?

 Capt. G. (Aside.) If she only wouldn't look at me. (Aloud and very slowly,
      his eyes on his plate.) D'you remember that evening in July, before the
      Rains broke, when you said that the end would have to come sooner or later—and
      you wondered for which of US it would come first?

 Mrs. H. Yes! I was only joking. And you swore that, as long as there was
      breath in your body, it should never come. And I believed you.

 Capt. G. (Fingering menu-card.) Well, it has. That's all.

 A long pause, during which Mrs. H. bows her head and rolls the bread-twist
      into little pellets; G. stares at the oleanders.

 Mrs. H. (Throwing back her head and laughing naturally.) They train us
      women well, don't they, Pip?

 Capt. G. (Brutally, touching shirt-stud.) So far as the expression goes.
      (Aside.) It isn't in her nature to take things quietly. There'll be an
      explosion yet.

 Mrs. H. (With a shudder.) Thank you. B-but even Red Indians allow people
      to wriggle when they're being tortured, I believe. (Slips fan from girdle
      and fans slowly: rim of fan level with chin.)

 PARTNER ON LEFT. Very close tonight, isn't it? 'You find it too much for
      you?

 Mrs. H. Oh, no, not in the least. But they really ought to have punkahs,
      even in your cool Naini Tal, oughtn't they? (Turns, dropping fan and
      raising eyebrows.)

 Capt. G. It's all right. (Aside.) Here comes the storm!

 Mrs. H. (Her eyes on the tablecloth: fan ready in right hand.) It was very
      cleverly managed, Pip, and I congratulate you. You swore—you never
      contented yourself with merely Saying a thing—you swore that, as far
      as lay in your power, you'd make my wretched life pleasant for me. And
      you've denied me the consolation of breaking down. I should have done it—indeed
      I should. A woman would hardly have thought of this refinement, my kind,
      considerate friend. (Fan-guard as before.) You have explained things so
      tenderly and truthfully, too! You haven't spoken or written a word of
      warning, and you have let me believe in you till the last minute. You
      haven't condescended to give me your reason yet. No! A woman could not
      have managed it half so well. Are there many men like you in the world?

 Capt. G. I'm sure I don't know. (To Khitmatgar.) Ohe! Simpkin do.

 Mrs. H. You call yourself a man of the world, don't you? Do men of the
      world behave like Devils when they do a woman the honor to get tired of
      her?

 Capt. G. I'm sure I don't know. Don't speak so loud!

 Mrs. H. Keep us respectable, O Lord, whatever happens. Don't be afraid of
      my compromising you. You've chosen your ground far too well, and I've been
      properly brought up. (Lowering fan.) Haven't you any pity, Pip, except for
      yourself?

 Capt. G. Wouldn't it be rather impertinent of me to say that I'm sorry for
      you?

 Mrs. H. I think you have said it once or twice before. You're growing very
      careful of my feelings. My God, Pip, I was a good woman once! You said I
      was. You've made me what I am. What are you going to do with me? What are
      you going to do with me? Won't you say that you are sorry? (Helps herself
      to iced asparagus.)

 Capt. G. I am sorry for you, if you WANT the pity of such a brute as I am.
      I'm awf'ly sorry for you.

 Mrs. H. Rather tame for a man of the world. Do you think that that
      admission clears you?

 Capt. G. What can I do? I can only tell you what I think of myself. You
      can't think worse than that?

 Mrs. H. Oh, yes, I can! And now, will you tell me the reason of all this?
      Remorse? Has Bayard been suddenly conscience-stricken?

 Capt. G. (Angrily, his eyes still lowered.) No! The thing has come to an
      end on my side. That's all. Mafisch!

 Mrs. H. “That's all. Mafisch!” As though I were a Cairene Dragoman. You
      used to make prettier speeches. D'you remember when you said?—

 Capt. G. For Heaven's sake don't bring that back! Call me anything you
      like and I'll admit it—

 Mrs. H. But you don't care to be reminded of old lies? If I could hope to
      hurt you one-tenth as much as you have hurt me tonight—No, I
      wouldn't—I couldn't do it—liar though you are.

 Capt. G. I've spoken the truth.

 Mrs. H. My dear Sir, you flatter yourself. You have lied over the reason.
      Pip, remember that I know you as you don't know yourself. You have been
      everything to me, though you are—(Fan-guard.) Oh, what a
      contemptible Thing it is! And so you are merely tired of me?

 Capt. G. Since you insist upon my repeating it—Yes.

 Mrs. H. Lie the first. I wish I knew a coarser word. Lie seems so
      ineffectual in your case. The fire has just died out and there is no fresh
      one? Think for a minute, Pip, if you care whether I despise you more than
      I do. Simply Mafisch, is it?

 Capt. G. Yes. (Aside.) I think I deserve this.

 Mrs. H. Lie number two. Before the next glass chokes you, tell me her
      name.

 Capt. G. (Aside.) I'll make her pay for dragging Minnie into the business!
      (Aloud.) Is it likely?

 Mrs. H. Very likely if you thought that it would flatter your vanity.
      You'd cry my name on the house-tops to make people turn round.

 Capt. G. I wish I had. There would have been an end to this business.

 Mrs. H. Oh, no, there would not—And so you were going to be virtuous
      and blase', were you? To come to me and say: “I've done with you. The
      incident is clo-osed.” I ought to be proud of having kept such a man so
      long.

 Capt. G. (Aside.) It only remains to pray for the end of the dinner.
      (Aloud.) You know what I think of myself.

 Mrs. H. As it's the only person in he world you ever do think of, and as I
      know your mind thoroughly, I do. You want to get it all over and—Oh,
      I can't keep you back! And you're going—think of it, Pip—to
      throw me over for another woman. And you swore that all other women were—Pip,
      my Pip! She can't care for you as I do. Believe me, she can't. Is it any
      one that I know?

 Capt. G. Thank Goodness it isn't. (Aside.) I expected a cyclone, but not
      an earthquake.

 Mrs. H. She can't! Is there anything that I wouldn't do for you—or
      haven't done? And to think that I should take this trouble over you,
      knowing what you are! Do you despise me for it?

 Capt. G. (Wiping his mouth to hide a smile.) Again? It's entirely a work
      of charity on your part.

 Mrs. H. Ahhh! But I have no right to resent it.—Is she
      better-looking than I? Who was it said?—

 Capt. G. No—not that!

 Mrs. H. I'll be more merciful than you were. Don't you know that all women
      are alike?

 Capt. G. (Aside.) Then this is the exception that proves the rule.

 Mrs. H. All of them! I'll tell you anything you like. I will, upon my
      word! They only want the admiration—from anybody—no matter who—anybody!
      But there is always one man that they care for more than any one else in
      the world, and would sacrifice all the others to. Oh, do listen! I've kept
      the Vaynor man trotting after me like a poodle, and he believes that he is
      the only man I am interested in. I'll tell you what he said to me.

 Capt. G. Spare him. (Aside.) I wonder what his version is.

 Mrs. H. He's been waiting for me to look at him all through dinner. Shall
      I do it, and you can see what an idiot he looks?

 Capt. G. “But what imports the nomination of this gentleman?”

 Mrs. H. Watch! (Sends a glance to the Vaynor man, who tries vainly to
      combine a mouthful of ice pudding, a smirk of self-satisfaction, a glare
      of intense devotion, and the stolidity of a British dining countenance.)

 Capt. G. (Critically.) He doesn't look pretty. Why didn't you wait till
      the spoon was out of his mouth?

 Mrs. H. To amuse you. She'll make an exhibition of you as I've made of
      him; and people will laugh at you. Oh, Pip, can't you see that? It's as
      plain as the noonday Sun. You'll be trotted about and told lies, and made
      a fool of like the others. I never made a fool of you, did I?

 Capt. G. (Aside.) What a clever little woman it is!

 Mrs. H. Well, what have you to say?

 Capt. G. I feel better.

 Mrs. H. Yes, I suppose so, after I have come down to your level. I
      couldn't have done it if I hadn't cared for you so much. I have spoken the
      truth.

 Capt. G. It doesn't alter the situation.

 Mrs. H. (Passionately.) Then she has said that she cares for you! Don't
      believe her, Pip. It's a lie—as bad as yours to me!

 Capt. G. Ssssteady! I've a notion that a friend of yours is looking at
      you.

 Mrs. H. He! I hate him. He introduced you to me.

 Capt. G. (Aside.) And some people would like women to assist in making the
      laws. Introduction to imply condonement. (Aloud.) Well, you see, if you
      can remember so far back as that, I couldn't, in common politeness, refuse
      the offer.

 Mrs. H. In common politeness I—We have got beyond that!

 Capt. G. (Aside.) Old ground means fresh trouble. (Aloud.) On my honor—

 Mrs. H. Your what? Ha, ha!

 Capt. G. Dishonor, then. She's not what you imagine. I meant to—

 Mrs. H. Don't tell me anything about her! She won't care for you, and when
      you come back, after having made an exhibition of yourself, you'll find me
      occupied with—

 Capt. G. (Insolently.) You couldn't while I am alive. (Aside.) If that
      doesn't bring her pride to her rescue, nothing will.

 Mrs. H. (Drawing herself up.) Couldn't do it? I—(Softening.) You're
      right. I don't believe I could—though you are what you are—a
      coward and a liar in grain.

 Capt. G. It doesn't hurt so much after your little lecture—with
      demonstrations.

 Mrs. H. One mass of vanity! Will nothing ever touch you in this life?
      There must be a Hereafter if it's only for the benefit of—But you
      will have it all to yourself.

 Capt. G. (Under his eyebrows.) Are you certain of that?

 Mrs. H. I shall have had mine in this life; and it will serve me right,

 Capt. G. But the admiration that you insisted on so strongly a moment ago?
      (Aside.) Oh, I am a brute!

 Mrs. H. (Fiercely.) Will that console me for knowing that you will go to
      her with the same words, the same arguments, and the—the same pet
      names you used to me? And if she cares for you, you two will laugh over my
      story. Won't that be punishment heavy enough even for me—even for
      me?—And it's all useless. That's another punishment.

 Capt. G. (Feebly.) Oh, come! I'm not so low as you think.

 Mrs. H. Not now, perhaps, but you will be. Oh, Pip, if a woman flatters
      your vanity, there's nothing on earth that you would not tell her; and no
      meanness that you would not do. Have I known you so long without knowing
      that?

 Capt. G. If you can trust me in nothing else—and I don't see why I
      should be trusted—you can count upon my holding my tongue.

 Mrs. H. If you denied everything you've said this evening and declared it
      was all in fun (a long pause), I'd trust you. Not otherwise. All I ask is,
      don't tell her my name. Please don't. A man might forget: a woman never
      would. (Looks up table and sees hostess beginning to collect eyes.) So
      it's all ended, through no fault of mine—Haven't I behaved
      beautifully? I've accepted your dismissal, and you managed it as cruelly
      as you could, and I have made you respect my sex, haven't I? (Arranging
      gloves and fan.) I only pray that she'll know you some day as I know you
      now. I wouldn't be you then, for I think even your conceit will be hurt. I
      hope she'll pay you back the humiliation you've brought on me. I hope—No.
      I don't! I can't give you up! I must have something to look forward to or
      I shall go crazy. When it's all over, come back to me, come back to me,
      and you'll find that you're my Pip still!

 Capt. G. (Very clearly.) False move, and you pay for it. It's a girl!

 Mrs. H. (Rising.) Then it was true! They said—but I wouldn't insult
      you by asking. A girl! I was a girl not very long ago. Be good to her,
      Pip. I daresay she believes in you.

 Goes out with an uncertain smile. He watches her through the door, and
      settles into a chair as the men redistribute themselves.

 Capt. G. Now, if there is any Power who looks after this world, will He
      kindly tell me what I have done? (Reaching out for the claret, and half
      aloud.) What have I done?

  

  









 WITH ANY AMAZEMENT

 And are not afraid with any amazement. —Marriage Service.

 SCENE. bachelor's bedroom-toilet-table arranged with unnatural neatness.

 CAPTAIN GADSBY asleep and snoring heavily. Time, 10:30 A. M.—a
      glorious autumn day at Simla. Enter delicately Captain MAFFLIN of GADSBY's
      regiment. Looks at sleeper, and shakes his head murmuring “Poor Gaddy.”
       Performs violent fantasia with hair-brushes on chairback.

 Capt. M. Wake up, my sleeping beauty! (Roars.)

 “Uprouse ye, then, my merry merry men!
    It is our opening day!
    It is our opening da-ay!”

 Gaddy, the little dicky-birds have been billing and cooing for ever so
      long; and I'm here!

 Capt. G. (Sitting up and yawning.) Mornin'. This is awf'ly good of you,
      old fellow. Most awf'ly good of you. Don't know what I should do without
      you. 'Pon my soul, I don't. 'Haven't slept a wink all night.

 Capt. M. I didn't get in till half-past eleven. 'Had a look at you then,
      and you seemed to be sleeping as soundly as a condemned criminal.

 Capt. G. Jack, if you want to make those disgustingly worn-out jokes,
      you'd better go away. (With portentous gravity.) It's the happiest day in
      my life.

 Capt. M. (Chuckling grimly.) Not by a very long chalk, my son. You're
      going through some of the most refined torture you've ever known. But be
      calm. I am with you. 'Shun! Dress!

 Capt. G. Eh! Wha-at?

 Capt. M. Do you suppose that you are your own master for the next twelve
      hours? If you do, of course—(Makes for the door.)

 Capt. G. No! For Goodness' sake, old man, don't do that! You'll see me
      through, won't you? I've been mugging up that beastly drill, and can't
      remember a line of it.

 Capt. M. (Overturning G.'s uniform.) Go and tub. Don't bother me. I'll
      give you ten minutes to dress in.

 INTERVAL, filled by the noise as of one splashing in the bath-room..

 Capt. G. (Emerging from dressing-room.) What time is it?

 Capt. M. Nearly eleven.

 Capt. G. Five hours more. O Lord!

 Capt. M. (Aside.) 'First sign of funk, that. 'Wonder if it's going to
      spread. (Aloud.) Come along to breakfast.

 Capt. G. I can't eat anything. I don't want any breakfast.

 Capt. M. (Aside.) So early! (Aloud) CAPTAIN Gadsby, I order you to eat
      breakfast, and a dashed good breakfast, too. None of your bridal airs and
      graces with me!

 Leads G. downstairs and stands over him while he eats two chops.

 Capt. G. (Who has looked at his watch thrice in the last five minutes.)
      What time is it?

 Capt. M. Time to come for a walk. Light up.

 Capt. G. I haven't smoked for ten days, and I won't now. (Takes cheroot
      which M. has cut for him, and blows smoke through his nose luxuriously.)
      We aren't going down the Mall, are we?

 Capt. M. (Aside.) They're all alike in these stages. (Aloud.) No, my
      Vestal. We're going along the quietest road we can find.

 Capt. G. Any chance of seeing Her?

 Capt. M. Innocent! No! Come along, and, if you want me for the final
      obsequies, don't cut my eye out with your stick.

 Capt. G. (Spinning round.) I say, isn't She the dearest creature that ever
      walked? What's the time? What comes after “wilt thou take this woman”?

 Capt. M. You go for the ring. R'c'lect it'll be on the top of my
      right-hand little finger, and just be careful how you draw it off, because
      I shall have the Verger's fees somewhere in my glove.

 Capt. G. (Walking forward hastily.) D—the Verger! Come along! It's
      past twelve and I haven't seen Her since yesterday evening. (Spinning
      round again.) She's an absolute angel, Jack, and She's a dashed deal too
      good for me. Look here, does She come up the aisle on my arm, or how?

 Capt. M. If I thought that there was the least chance of your remembering
      anything for two consecutive minutes, I'd tell you. Stop passaging about
      like that!

 Capt. G. (Halting in the middle of the road.) I say, Jack.

 Capt. M. Keep quiet for another ten minutes if you can, you lunatic; and
      walk!

 The two tramp at five miles an hour for fifteen minutes.

 Capt. G. What's the time? How about the cursed wedding-cake and the
      slippers? They don't throw 'em about in church, do they?

 Capt. M. Invariably. The Padre leads off with his boots.

 Capt. G. Confound your silly soul! Don't make fun of me. I can't stand it,
      and I won't!

 Capt. M. (Untroubled.) So-ooo, old horse You'll have to sleep for a couple
      of hours this afternoon.

 Capt. G. (Spinning round.) I'm not going to be treated like a dashed
      child, understand that.

 Capt. M. (Aside.) Nerves gone to fiddle-strings. What a day we're having!
      (Tenderly putting his hand on G.'s shoulder.) My David, how long have you
      known this Jonathan? Would I come up here to make a fool of you—after
      all these years?

 Capt. G. (Penitently.) I know, I know, Jack—but I'm as upset as I
      can be. Don't mind what I say. Just hear me run through the drill and see
      if I've got it all right:—“To have and to hold for better or worse,
      as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end,
      so help me God. Amen.”

 Capt. M. (Suffocating with suppressed laughter.) Yes. That's about the
      gist of it. I'll prompt if you get into a hat.

 Capt. G. (Earnestly.) Yes, you'll stick by me, Jack, won't you? I'm
      awfully happy, but I don't mind telling you that I'm in a blue funk!

 Capt. M. (Gravely.) Are you? I should never have noticed it. You don't
      look like it.

 Capt. G. Don't I? That's all right. (Spinning round.) On my soul and
      honor, Jack, She's the sweetest little angel that ever came down from the
      sky. There isn't a woman on earth fit to speak to Her.

 Capt. M. (Aside.) And this is old Gadsby! (Aloud.) Go on if it relieves
      you.

 Capt. G. You can laugh! That's all you wild asses of bachelors are fit
      for.

 Capt. M. (Drawling.) You never would wait for the troop to come up. You
      aren't quite married yet, y'know.

 Capt. G. Ugh! That reminds me. I don't believe I shall be able to get into
      any boots Let's go home and try 'em on (Hurries forward.)

 Capt. M. 'Wouldn't be in your shoes for anything that Asia has to offer.

 Capt. G. (Spinning round.) That just shows your hideous blackness of soul—your
      dense stupidity—your brutal narrow-mindedness. There's only one
      fault about you. You're the best of good fellows, and I don't know what I
      should have done without you, but—you aren't married. (Wags his head
      gravely.) Take a wife, Jack.

 Capt. M. (With a face like a wall.) Ya-as. Whose for choice?

 Capt. G. If you're going to be a blackguard, I'm going on—What's the
      time?

 Capt. M. (Hums.) An' since 'twas very clear we drank only ginger-beer,
      Faith, there must ha' been some stingo in the ginger. Come back, you
      maniac. I'm going to take you home, and you're going to lie down.

 Capt. G. What on earth do I want to lie down for?

 Capt. M. Give me a light from your cheroot and see.

 Capt. G. (Watching cheroot-butt quiver like a tuning-fork.) Sweet state
      I'm in!

 Capt. M. You are. I'll get you a peg and you'll go to sleep.

 They return and M. compounds a four-finger peg.

 Capt. G. O bus! bus! It'll make me as drunk as an owl.

 Capt. M. 'Curious thing, 'twon't have the slightest effect on you. Drink
      it off, chuck yourself down there, and go to bye-bye.

 Capt. G. It's absurd. I sha'n't sleep, I know I sha'n't!

 Falls into heavy doze at end of seven minutes. Capt. M. watches him
      tenderly.

 Capt. M. Poor old Gadsby! I've seen a few turned off before, but never one
      who went to the gallows in this condition. 'Can't tell how it affects 'em,
      though. It's the thoroughbreds that sweat when they're backed into
      double-harness.—And that's the man who went through the guns at
      Amdheran like a devil possessed of devils. (Leans over G.) But this is
      worse than the guns, old pal—worse than the guns, isn't it? (G.
      turns in his sleep, and M. touches him clumsily on the forehead.) Poor,
      dear old Gaddy! Going like the rest of 'em—going like the rest of
      'em—Friend that sticketh closer than a brother—eight years.
      Dashed bit of a slip of a girl—eight weeks! And—where's your
      friend? (Smokes disconsolately till church clock strikes three.)

 Capt. M. Up with you! Get into your kit.

 Capt. C. Already? Isn't it too soon? Hadn't I better have a shave?

 Capt. M. No! You're all right. (Aside.) He'd chip his chin to pieces.

 Capt. C. What's the hurry?

 Capt. M. You've got to be there first.

 Capt. C. To be stared at?

 Capt. M. Exactly. You're part of the show. Where's the burnisher? Your
      spurs are in a shameful state.

 Capt. G. (Gruffly.) Jack, I be damned if you shall do that for me.

 Capt. M. (More gruffly.) Dry up and get dressed! If I choose to clean your
      spurs, you're under my orders.

 Capt. G. dresses. M. follows suit.

 Capt. M. (Critically, walking round.) M'—yes, you'll do. Only don't
      look so like a criminal. Ring, gloves, fees—that's all right for me.
      Let your moustache alone. Now, if the ponies are ready, we'll go.

 Capt. G. (Nervously.) It's much too soon. Let's light up! Let's have a
      peg! Let's—

 Capt. M. Let's make bally asses of ourselves!

 BELLS. (Without.)—“Good-peo-ple-all To prayers-we call.”

 Capt. M. There go the bells! Come on—unless you'd rather not. (They
      ride off.)

 BELLS.—“We honor the King And Brides joy do bring—Good tidings
      we tell, And ring the Dead's knell.”

 Capt. G. (Dismounting at the door of the Church.) I say, aren't we much
      too soon? There are no end of people inside. I say, aren't we much too
      late? Stick by me, Jack! What the devil do I do?

 Capt. M. Strike an attitude at the head of the aisle and wait for Her. (G.
      groans as M. wheels him into position before three hundred eyes.)

 Capt. M. (Imploringly.) Gaddy, if you love me, for pity's sake, for the
      Honor of the Regiment, stand up! Chuck yourself into your uniform! Look
      like a man! I've got to speak to the Padre a minute. (G. breaks into a
      gentle Perspiration.) If you wipe your face I'll never be your best man
      again. Stand up! (G. trembles visibly.)

 Capt. M. (Returning.) She's coming now. Look out when the music starts.
      There's the organ beginning to clack.

 Bride steps out of 'rickshaw at Church door. G. catches a glimpse of her
      and takes heart.

 ORGAN.—“The Voice that breathed o'er Eden, That earliest marriage
      day, The primal marriage-blessing, It hath not passed away.”

 Capt. M. (Watching G.) By Jove! He is looking well. 'Didn't think he had
      it in him.

 Capt. G. How long does this hymn go on for?

 Capt. M. It will be over directly. (Anxiously.) (Beginning to bleach and
      gulp.) Hold on, Gabby, and think 'o the Regiment.

 Capt. G. (Measuredly.) I say, there's a big brown lizard crawling up that
      wall.

 Capt. M. My Sainted Mother! The last stage of collapse!

 Bride comes up to left of altar, lifts her eyes once to G., who is
      suddenly smitten mad.

 Capt. G. (To himself again and again.) Little Featherweight's a woman—a
      woman! And I thought she was a little girl.

 Capt. M. (In a whisper.) Form the halt—inward wheel.

 Capt. G. obeys mechanically and the ceremony proceeds.

 PADRE.... only unto her as ye both shall live?

 Capt. G. (His throat useless.) Ha-hmmm!

 Capt. M. Say you will or you won't. There's no second deal here.

 Bride gives response with perfect coolness, and is given away by the
      father.

 Capt. G. (Thinking to show his learning.) Jack give me away now, quick!

 Capt. M. You've given yourself away quite enough. Her right hand, man!
      Repeat! Repeat! “Theodore Philip.” Have you forgotten your own name?

 Capt. G. stumbles through Affirmation, which Bride repeats without a
      tremor.

 Capt. M. Now the ring! Follow the Padre! Don't pull off my glove! Here it
      is! Great Cupid, he's found his voice.

 Capt. G. repeats Troth in a voice to be heard to the end of the Church and
      turns on his heel.

 Capt. M. (Desperately.) Rein back! Back to your troop! 'Tisn't half legal
      yet.

 PADRE.... joined together let no man put asunder.

 Capt. G. paralyzed with fear jibs after Blessing.

 Capt. M. (Quickly.) On your own front—one length. Take her with you.
      I don't come. You've nothing to say. (Capt. G. jingles up to altar.)

 Capt. M. (In a piercing rattle meant to be a whisper.) Kneel, you
      stiff-necked ruffian! Kneel!

 PADRE... whose daughters are ye so long as ye do well and are not afraid
      with any amazement.

 Capt. M. Dismiss! Break off! Left wheel!

 All troop to vestry. They sign.

 Capt. M. Kiss Her, Gaddy.

 Capt. G. (Rubbing the ink into his glove.) Eh! Wha-at?

 Capt. M. (Taking one pace to Bride.) If you don't, I shall.

 Capt. G. (Interposing an arm.) Not this journey!

 General kissing, in which Capt. G. is pursued by unknown female.

 Capt. G. (Faintly to M.) This is Hades! Can I wipe my face now?

 Capt. M. My responsibility has ended. Better ask Misses GADSBY.

 Capt. G. winces as though shot and procession is Mendelssohned out of
      Church to house, where usual tortures take place over the wedding-cake.

 Capt. M. (At table.) Up with you, Gaddy. They expect a speech.

 Capt. G. (After three minutes' agony.) Ha-hmmm. (Thunders Of applause.)

 Capt. M. Doocid good, for a first attempt. Now go and change your kit
      while Mamma is weeping over “the Missus.” (Capt. G. disappears. Capt. M.
      starts up tearing his hair.) It's not half legal. Where are the shoes? Get
      an ayah.

 AYAH. Missie Captain Sahib done gone band karo all the jutis.

 Capt. M. (Brandishing scab larded sword.) Woman, produce those shoes! Some
      one lend me a bread-knife. We mustn't crack Gaddy's head more than it is.
      (Slices heel off white satin slipper and puts slipper up his sleeve.)

 Where is the Bride? (To the company at large.) Be tender with that rice.
      It's a heathen custom. Give me the big bag.

  Bride slips out quietly into 'rickshaw and departs toward the sunset.

 Capt. M. (In the open.) Stole away, by Jove! So much the worse for Gaddy!
      Here he is. Now Gaddy, this'll be livelier than Amdberan! Where's your
      horse?

 Capt. G. (Furiously, seeing that the women are out of an earshot.) Where
      the d——'s my Wife?

 Capt. M. Half-way to Mahasu by this time. You'll have to ride like Young
      Lochinvar.

 Horse comes round on his hind legs; refuses to let G. handle him.

 Capt. G. Oh you will, will you? Get 'round, you brute—you hog—you
      beast! Get round!

 Wrenches horse's head over, nearly breaking lower jaw: swings himself into
      saddle, and sends home both spurs in the midst of a spattering gale of
      Best Patna.

 Capt. M. For your life and your love—ride, Gaddy—And God bless
      you!

 Throws half a pound of rice at G. who disappears, bowed forward on the
      saddle, in a cloud of sunlit dust.

 Capt. M. I've lost old Gaddy. (Lights cigarette and strolls off, singing
      absently):—“You may carve it on his tombstone, you may cut it on his
      card, That a young man married is a young man marred!”

 Miss DEERCOURT. (From her horse.) Really, Captain Mafflin! You are more
      plain spoken than polite!

 Capt. M. (Aside.) They say marriage is like cholera. 'Wonder who'll be the
      next victim.

 White satin slipper slides from his sleeve and falls at his feet. Left
      wondering.

  

  









 THE GARDEN OF EDEN

 And ye shall be as—Gods!

 SCENE. Thymy grass-plot at back of the Mahasu dak-bungalow, overlooking
      little wooded valley. On the left, glimpse of the Dead Forest of Fagoo; on
      the right, Simla Hills. In background, line of the Snows. CAPTAIN GADSBY,
      now three weeks a husband, is smoking the pipe of peace on a rug in the
      sunshine. Banjo and tobacco-pouch on rug. Overhead the Fagoo eagles. Mrs.
      G. comes out of bungalow.

 Mrs. G. My husband!

 Capt. G. (Lazily, with intense enjoyment.) Eh, wha-at? Say that again.

 Mrs. G. I've written to Mamma and told her that we shall be back on the
      17th.

 Capt. G. Did you give her my love?

 Mrs. G. No, I kept all that for myself. (Sitting down by his side.) I
      thought you wouldn't mind.

 Capt. G. (With mock sternness.) I object awf'ly. How did you know that it
      was yours to keep?

 Mrs. G. I guessed, Phil.

 Capt. G. (Rapturously.) Lit-tle Featherweight!

 Mrs. G. I won' t be called those sporting pet names, bad boy.

 Capt. G. You'll be called anything I choose. Has it ever occurred to you,
      Madam, that you are my Wife?

 Mrs. G. It has. I haven't ceased wondering at it yet.

 Capt. G. Nor I. It seems so strange; and yet, somehow, it doesn't.
      (Confidently.) You see, it could have been no one else.

 Mrs. G. (Softly.) No. No one else—for me or for you. It must have
      been all arranged from the beginning. Phil, tell me again what made you
      care for me.

 Capt. G. How could I help it? You were you, you know.

 Mrs. G. Did you ever want to help it? Speak the truth!

 Capt. G. (A twinkle in his eye.) I did, darling, just at the first. Rut
      only at the very first. (Chuckles.) I called you—stoop low and I'll
      whisper—“a little beast.” Ho! Ho! Ho!

 Mrs. G. (Taking him by the moustache and making him sit up.)
      “A-little-beast!” Stop laughing over your crime! And yet you had the—the—awful
      cheek to propose to me!

 Capt. C. I'd changed my mind then. And you weren't a little beast any
      more.

 Mrs. G. Thank you, sir! And when was I ever?

 Capt. G. Never! But that first day, when you gave me tea in that
      peach-colored muslin gown thing, you looked—you did indeed, dear—such
      an absurd little mite. And I didn't know what to say to you.

 Mrs. G. (Twisting moustache.) So you said “little beast.” Upon my word,
      Sir! I called you a “Crrrreature,” but I wish now I had called you
      something worse.

 Capt. G. (Very meekly.) I apologize, but you're hurting me awf'ly.
      (Interlude.) You're welcome to torture me again on those terms.

 Mrs. G. Oh, why did you let me do it?

 Capt. G. (Looking across valley.) No reason in particular, but—if it
      amused you or did you any good—you might—wipe those dear
      little boots of yours on me.

 Mrs. G. (Stretching out her hands.) Don't! Oh, don't! Philip, my King,
      please don't talk like that. It's how I feel. You're so much too good for
      me. So much too good!

 Capt. G. Me! I'm not fit to put my arm around you. (Puts it round.)

 Mrs. C. Yes, you are. But I—what have I ever done?

 Capt. G. Given me a wee bit of your heart, haven't you, my Queen!

 Mrs. G. That's nothing. Any one would do that. They cou—couldn'thelp
      it.

 Capt. G. Pussy, you'll make me horribly conceited. Just when I was
      beginning to feel so humble, too.

 Mrs. G. Humble! I don't believe it's in your character.

 Capt. G. What do you know of my character, Impertinence?

 Mrs. G. Ah, but I shall, shan't I, Phil? I shall have time in all the
      years and years to come, to know everything about you; and there will be
      no secrets between us.

 Capt. G. Little witch! I believe you know me thoroughly already.

 Mrs. G. I think I can guess. You're selfish?

 Capt. G. Yes.

 Mrs. G. Foolish?

 Capt. G. Very.

 Mrs. G. And a dear?

 Capt. G. That is as my lady pleases.

 Mrs. G. Then your lady is pleased. (A pause.) D'you know that we're two
      solemn, serious, grown-up people—

 Capt. G. (Tilting her straw hat over her eyes.) You grown-up! Pooh! You're
      a baby.

 Mrs. G. And we're talking nonsense.

 Capt. G. Then let's go on talking nonsense. I rather like it. Pussy, I'll
      tell you a secret. Promise not to repeat?

 Mrs. G. Ye-es. Only to you.

 Capt. G. I love you.

 Mrs. G. Re-ally! For how long?

 Capt. G. Forever and ever.

 Mrs. G. That's a long time.

 Capt. G. 'Think so? It's the shortest I can do with.

 Mrs. G. You're getting quite clever.

 Capt. G. I'm talking to you.

 Mrs. G. Prettily turned. Hold up your stupid old head and I'll pay you for
      it.

 Capt. G. (Affecting supreme contempt.) Take it yourself if you want it.

 Mrs. G. I've a great mind to—and I will! (Takes it and is repaid
      with interest.)

 Capt. G, Little Featherweight, it's my opinion that we are a couple of
      idiots.

 Mrs. G. We're the only two sensible people in the world. Ask the eagle.
      He's coming by.

 Capt. G. Ah! I dare say he's seen a good many sensible people at Mahasu.
      They say that those birds live for ever so long.

 Mrs. G. How long?

 Capt. G. A hundred and twenty years.

 Mrs. G. A hundred and twenty years! O-oh! And in a hundred and twenty
      years where will these two sensible people be?

 Capt. G. What does it matter so long as we are together now?

 Mrs. G. (Looking round the horizon.) Yes. Only you and I—I and you—in
      the whole wide, wide world until the end. (Sees the line of the Snows.)
      How big and quiet the hills look! D'you think they care for us?

 Capt. G. 'Can't say I've consulted 'em particularly. I care, and that's
      enough for me.

 Mrs. G. (Drawing nearer to him.) Yes, now—but afterward. What's that
      little black blur on the Snows?

 Capt. G. A snowstorm, forty miles away. You'll see it move, as the wind
      carries it across the face of that spur and then it will be all gone.

 Mrs. G. And then it will be all gone. (Shivers.)

 Capt. G. (Anxiously.) 'Not chilled, pet, are you? 'Better let me get your
      cloak.

 Mrs. G. No. Don't leave me, Phil. Stay here. I believe I am afraid. Oh,
      why are the hills so horrid! Phil, promise me that you'll always love me.

 Capt. G. What's the trouble, darling? I can't promise any more than I
      have; but I'll promise that again and again if you like.

 Mrs. G. (Her head on his shoulder.) Say it, then—say it! N-no—don't!
      The—the—eagles would laugh. (Recovering.) My husband, you've
      married a little goose.

 Capt. G. (Very tenderly.) Have I? I am content whatever she is, so long as
      she is mine.

 Mrs. G. (Quickly.) Because she is yours or because she is me mineself?

 Capt. G. Because she is both. (Piteously.) I'm not clever, dear, and I
      don't think I can make myself understood properly.

 Mrs. G. I understand. Pip, will you tell me something?

 Capt. G. Anything you like. (Aside.) I wonder what's coming now.

 Mrs. G. (Haltingly, her eyes lowered.) You told me once in the old days—centuries
      and centuries ago—that you had been engaged before. I didn't say
      anything—then.

 Capt. G. (Innocently.) Why not?

 Mrs. G. (Raising her eyes to his.) Because—because I was afraid of
      losing you, my heart. But now—tell about it—please.

 Capt. G. There's nothing to tell. I was awf'ly old then—nearly two
      and twenty—and she was quite that.

 Mrs. G. That means she was older than you. I shouldn't like her to have
      been younger. Well?

 Capt. G. Well, I fancied myself in love and raved about a bit, and—oh,
      yes, by Jove! I made up poetry. Ha! Ha!

 Mrs. G. You never wrote any for me! What happened?

 Capt. G. I came out here, and the whole thing went phut. She wrote to say
      that there had been a mistake, and then she married.

 Mrs. G. Did she care for you much?

 Capt. G. No. At least she didn't show it as far as I remember.

 Mrs. G. As far as you remember! Do you remember her name? (Hears it and
      bows her head.) Thank you, my husband.

 Capt. G. Who but you had the right? Now, Little Featherweight, have you
      ever been mixed up in any dark and dismal tragedy?

 Mrs. G. If you call me Mrs. Gadsby, p'raps I'll tell.

 Capt. G. (Throwing Parade rasp into his voice.) Mrs. Gadsby, confess!

 Mrs. G. Good Heavens, Phil! I never knew that you could speak in that
      terrible voice.

 Capt. G. You don't know half my accomplishments yet. Wait till we are
      settled in the Plains, and I'll show you how I bark at my troop. You were
      going to say, darling?

 Mrs. G. I—I don't like to, after that voice. (Tremulously.) Phil,
      never you dare to speak to me in that tone, whatever I may do!

 Capt. G. My poor little love! Why, you're shaking all over. I am so sorry.
      Of course I never meant to upset you Don't tell me anything, I'm a brute.

 Mrs. G. No, you aren't, and I will tell—There was a man.

 Capt. G. (Lightly.) Was there? Lucky man!

 Mrs. G. (In a whisper.) And I thought I cared for him.

 Capt. G. Still luckier man! Well?

 Mrs. G. And I thought I cared for him—and I didn't—and then
      you came—and I cared for you very, very much indeed. That's all.
      (Face hidden.) You aren't angry, are you?

 Capt. G. Angry? Not in the least. (Aside.) Good Lord, what have I done to
      deserve this angel?

 Mrs. G. (Aside.) And he never asked for the name! How funny men are! But
      perhaps it's as well.

 Capt. G. That man will go to heaven because you once thought you cared for
      him. 'Wonder if you'll ever drag me up there?

 Mrs. G. (Firmly.) 'Sha'n't go if you don't.

 Capt. G. Thanks. I say, Pussy, I don't know much about your religious
      beliefs. You were brought up to believe in a heaven and all that, weren't
      you?

 Mrs. G. Yes. But it was a pincushion heaven, with hymn-books in all the
      pews.

 Capt. G. (Wagging his head with intense conviction.) Never mind. There is
      a pukka heaven.

 Mrs. G. Where do you bring that message from, my prophet?

 Capt. G. Here! Because we care for each other. So it's all right.

 Mrs. G. (As a troop of langurs crash through the branches.) So it's all
      right. But Darwin says that we came from those!

 Capt. G. (Placidly.) Ah! Darwin was never in love with an angel. That
      settles it. Sstt, you brutes! Monkeys, indeed! You shouldn't read those
      books.

 Mrs. G. (Folding her hands.) If it pleases my Lord the King to issue
      proclamation.

 Capt. G. Don't, dear one. There are no orders between us. Only I'd rather
      you didn't. They lead to nothing, and bother people's heads.

 Mrs. G. Like your first engagement.

 Capt. G. (With an immense calm.) That was a necessary evil and led to you.
      Are you nothing?

 Mrs. G. Not so very much, am I?

 Capt. G. All this world and the next to me.

 Mrs. G. (Very softly.) My boy of boys! Shall I tell you something?

 Capt. G. Yes, if it's not dreadful—about other men.

 Mrs. G. It's about my own bad little self.

 Capt. G. Then it must be good. Go on, dear.

 Mrs. G. (Slowly.) I don't know why I'm telling you, Pip; but if ever you
      marry again—(Interlude.) Take your hand from my mouth or I'll bite!
      In the future, then remember—I don't know quite how to put it!

 Capt. G. (Snorting indignantly.) Don't try. “Marry again,” indeed!

 Mrs. G. I must. Listen, my husband. Never, never, never tell your wife
      anything that you do not wish her to remember and think over all her life.
      Because a woman—yes, I am a woman—can't forget.

 Capt. G. By Jove, how do you know that?

 Mrs. G. (Confusedly.) I don't. I'm only guessing. I am—I was—a
      silly little girl; but I feel that I know so much, oh, so very much more
      than you, dearest. To begin with, I'm your wife.

 Capt. G. So I have been led to believe.

 Mrs. G. And I shall want to know every one of your secrets—to share
      everything you know with you. (Stares round desperately.)

 Capt. G. So you shall, dear, so you shall—but don't look like that.

 Mrs. G. For your own sake don't stop me, Phil. I shall never talk to you
      in this way again. You must not tell me! At least, not now. Later on, when
      I'm an old matron it won't matter, but if you love me, be very good to me
      now; for this part of my life I shall never forget! Have I made you
      understand?

 Capt. G. I think so, child. Have I said anything yet that you disapprove
      of?

 Mrs. G. Will you be very angry? That—that voice, and what you said
      about the engagement—

 Capt. G. But you asked to be told that, darling.

 Mrs. G. And that's why you shouldn't have told me! You must be the Judge,
      and, oh, Pip, dearly as I love you, I shan't be able to help you! I shall
      hinder you, and you must judge in spite of me!

 Capt. G. (Meditatively.) We have a great many things to find out together,
      God help us both—say so, Pussy—but we shall understand each
      other better every day; and I think I'm beginning to see now. How in the
      world did you come to know just the importance of giving me just that
      lead?

 Mrs. G. I've told you that I don't know. Only somehow it seemed that, in
      all this new life, I was being guided for your sake as well as my own.

 Capt. G. (Aside.) Then Mafflin was right! They know, and we—we're
      blind all of us. (Lightly.) 'Getting a little beyond our depth, dear,
      aren't we? I'll remember, and, if I fail, let me be punished as I deserve.

 Mrs. G. There shall be no punishment. We'll start into life together from
      here—you and I—and no one else.

 Capt. G. And no one else. (A pause.) Your eyelashes are all wet, Sweet?
      Was there ever such a quaint little Absurdity?

 Mrs. G. Was there ever such nonsense talked before?

 Capt. G. (Knocking the ashes out of his pipe.) 'Tisn't what we say, it's
      what we don't say, that helps. And it's all the profoundest philosophy.
      But no one would understand—even if it were put into a book.

 Mrs. G. The idea! No—only we ourselves, or people like ourselves—if
      there are any people like us.

 Capt. G. (Magisterially.) All people, not like ourselves, are blind
      idiots.

 Mrs. G. (Wiping her eyes.) Do you think, then, that there are any people
      as happy as we are?

 Capt. G. 'Must be—unless we've appropriated all the happiness in the
      world.

 Mrs. G. (Looking toward Simla.) Poor dears! Just fancy if we have!

 Capt. G. Then we'll hang on to the whole show, for it's a great deal too
      jolly to lose—eh, wife 'o mine?

 Mrs. G. O Pip! Pip! How much of you is a solemn, married man and how much
      a horrid slangy schoolboy?

 Capt. G. When you tell me how much of you was eighteen last birthday and
      how much is as old as the Sphinx and twice as mysterious, perhaps I'll
      attend to you. Lend me that banjo. The spirit moveth me to yowl at the
      sunset.

 Mrs. G. Mind! It's not tuned. Ah! How that jars!

 Capt. G. (Turning pegs.) It's amazingly different to keep a banjo to
      proper pitch.

 Mrs. G. It's the same with all musical instruments, What shall it be?

 Capt. G. “Vanity,” and let the hills hear. (Sings through the first and
      half of the second verse. Turning to Mrs. G.) Now, chorus! Sing, Pussy!

 BOTH TOGETHER. (Con brio, to the horror of the monkeys who are settling
      for the night.)—

 “Vanity, all is Vanity,” said Wisdom, scorning me—I clasped my true
      Love's tender hand and answered frank and free-ee “If this be Vanity who'd
      be wise? If this be Vanity who'd be wise? If this be Vanity who'd be
      wi-ise (Crescendo.) Vanity let it be!”

 Mrs. G. (Defiantly to the grey of the evening sky.) “Vanity let it be!”

 ECHO. (Prom the Fagoo spur.) Let it be!

  

  









 FATIMA

 And you may go in every room of the house and see everything that is
      there, but into the Blue Room you must not go. —The Story of Blue
      Beard.

 SCENE. The GADSBYS' bungalow in the Plains. Time, 11 A. M. on a Sunday
      morning. Captain GADSBY, in his shirt-sleeves, is bending over a complete
      set of Hussar's equipment, from saddle to picketing-rope, which is neatly
      spread over the floor of his study. He is smoking an unclean briar, and
      his forehead is puckered with thought.

 Capt. G. (To himself, fingering a headstall.) Jack's an ass. There's
      enough brass on this to load a mule—and, if the Americans know
      anything about anything, it can be cut down to a bit only. 'Don't want the
      watering-bridle, either. Humbug!—Half a dozen sets of chains and
      pulleys for one horse! Rot! (Scratching his head.) Now, let's consider it
      all over from the beginning. By Jove, I've forgotten the scale of weights!
      Never mind. 'Keep the bit only, and eliminate every boss from the crupper
      to breastplate. No breastplate at all. Simple leather strap across the
      breast—like the Russians. Hi! Jack never thought of that!

 Mrs. G. (Entering hastily, her hand bound in a cloth.) Oh, Pip, I've
      scalded my hand over that horrid, horrid Tiparee jam!

 Capt. G. (Absently.) Eh! Wha-at?

 Mrs. G. (With round-eyed reproach.) I've scalded it aw-fully! Aren't you
      sorry? And I did so want that jam to jam properly.

 Capt. G. Poor little woman! Let me kiss the place and make it well.
      (Unrolling bandage.) You small sinner! Where's that scald? I can't see it.

 Mrs. G. On the top of the little finger. There!—It's a most 'normous
      big burn!

 Capt. G. (Kissing little finger.) Baby! Let Hyder look after the jam. You
      know I don't care for sweets.

 Mrs. G. Indeed?—Pip!

 Capt. G. Not of that kind, anyhow. And now run along, Minnie, and leave me
      to my own base devices. I'm busy.

 Mrs. G. (Calmly settling herself in long chair.) So I see. What a mess
      you're making! Why have you brought all that smelly leather stuff into the
      house?

 Capt. G. To play with. Do you mind, dear?

 Mrs. G. Let me play too. I'd like it.

 Capt. G. I'm afraid you wouldn't. Pussy—Don't you think that jam
      will burn, or whatever it is that jam does when it's not looked after by a
      clever little housekeeper?

 Mrs. G. I thought you said Hyder could attend to it. I left him in the
      veranda, stirring—when I hurt myself so.

 Capt. G. (His eye returning to the equipment.) Po-oor little woman!—Three
      pounds four and seven is three eleven, and that can be cut down to two
      eight, with just a lee-tle care, without weakening anything. Farriery is
      all rot in incompetent hands. What's the use of a shoe-case when a man's
      scouting? He can't stick it on with a lick—like a stamp—the
      shoe! Skittles—

 Mrs. G. What's skittles? Pah! What is this leather cleaned with?

 Capt. G. Cream and champagne and—Look here, dear, do you really want
      to talk to me about anything important?

 Mrs. G. No. I've done my accounts, and I thought I'd like to see what
      you're doing.

 Capt. G. Well, love, now you've seen and—Would you mind?—That
      is to say—Minnie, I really am busy.

 Mrs. G. You want me to go?

 Capt. G, Yes, dear, for a little while. This tobacco will hang in your
      dress, and saddlery doesn't interest you.

 Mrs. G. Everything you do interests me, Pip.

 Capt. G. Yes, I know, I know, dear. I'll tell you all about it some day
      when I've put a head on this thing. In the meantime—

 Mrs. G. I'm to be turned out of the room like a troublesome child?

 Capt. G. No-o. I don't mean that exactly. But, you see, I shall be
      tramping up and down, shifting these things to and fro, and I shall be in
      your way. Don't you think so?

 Mrs. G. Can't I lift them about? Let me try. (Reaches forward to trooper's
      saddle.)

 Capt. G. Good gracious, child, don't touch it. You'll hurt yourself.
      (Picking up saddle.) Little girls aren't expected to handle numdahs. Now,
      where would you like it put? (Holds saddle above his head.)

 Mrs. G. (A break in her voice.) Nowhere. Pip, how good you are—and
      how strong! Oh, what's that ugly red streak inside your arm?

 Capt. G. (Lowering saddle quickly.) Nothing. It's a mark of sorts.
      (Aside.) And Jack's coming to tiffin with his notions all cut and dried!

 Mrs. G. I know it's a mark, but I've never seen it before. It runs all up
      the arm. What is it?

 Capt. G. A cut—if you want to know.

 Mrs. G. Want to know! Of course I do! I can't have my husband cut to
      pieces in this way. How did it come? Was it an accident? Tell me, Pip.

 Capt. G. (Grimly.) No. 'Twasn't an accident. I got it—from a man—in
      Afghanistan.

 Mrs. G. In action? Oh, Pip, and you never told me!

 Capt. G. I'd forgotten all about it.

 Mrs. G. Hold up your arm! What a horrid, ugly scar! Are you sure it
      doesn't hurt now! How did the man give it you?

 Capt. G. (Desperately looking at his watch.) With a knife. I came down—old
      Van Loo did, that's to say—and fell on my leg, so I couldn't run.
      And then this man came up and began chopping at me as I sprawled.

 Mrs. G. Oh, don't, don't! That's enough!—Well, what happened?

 Capt. G. I couldn't get to my holster, and Mafflin came round the corner
      and stopped the performance.

 Mrs. G. How? He's such a lazy man, I don't believe he did.

 Capt. G. Don't you? I don't think the man had much doubt about it. Jack
      cut his head off.

 Mrs. G. Cut-his-head-off! “With one blow,” as they say in the books?

 Capt. G. I'm not sure. I was too interested in myself to know much about
      it. Anyhow, the head was off, and Jack was punching old Van Loo in the
      ribs to make him get up. Now you know all about it, dear, and now—

 Mrs. G. You want me to go, of course. You never told me about this, though
      I've been married to you for ever so long; and you never would have told
      me if I hadn't found out; and you never do tell me anything about
      yourself, or what you do, or what you take an interest in.

 Capt. G. Darling, I'm always with you, aren't I?

 Mrs. G. Always in my pocket, you were going to say. I know you are; but
      you are always thinking away from me.

 Capt. G. (Trying to hide a smile.) Am I? I wasn't aware of it. I'm awf'ly
      sorry.

 Mrs. G. (Piteously.) Oh, don't make fun of me! Pip, you know what I mean.
      When you are reading one of those things about Cavalry, by that idiotic
      Prince—why doesn't he be a Prince instead of a stable-boy?

 Capt. G. Prince Kraft a stable-boy—Oh, my Aunt! Never mind, dear.
      You were going to say?

 Mrs. G. It doesn't matter; you don't care for what I say. Only—only
      you get up and walk about the room, staring in front of you, and then
      Mafflin comes in to dinner, and after I'm in the drawing-room I can hear
      you and him talking, and talking, and talking, about things I can't
      understand, and—oh, I get so tired and feel so lonely!—I don't
      want to complain and be a trouble, Pip; but I do indeed I do!

 Capt. G. My poor darling! I never thought of that. Why don't you ask some
      nice people in to dinner?

 Mrs. G. Nice people! Where am I to find them? Horrid frumps! And if I did,
      I shouldn't be amused. You know I only want you.

 Capt. G. And you have me surely, Sweetheart?

 Mrs. G. I have not! Pip why don't you take me into your life?

 Capt. G. More than I do? That would be difficult, dear.

 Mrs. G. Yes, I suppose it would—to you. I'm no help to you—no
      companion to you; and you like to have it so.

 Capt. G. Aren't you a little unreasonable, Pussy?

 Mrs. G. (Stamping her foot.) I'm the most reasonable woman in the world—when
      I'm treated properly.

 Capt. G. And since when have I been treating you improperly?

 Mrs. G. Always—and since the beginning. You know you have.

 Capt. G. I don't; but I'm willing to be convinced.

 Mrs. G. (Pointing to saddlery.) There!

 Capt. G. How do you mean?

 Mrs. G. What does all that mean? Why am I not to be told? Is it so
      precious?

 Capt. G. I forget its exact Government value just at present. It means
      that it is a great deal too heavy.

 Mrs. G. Then why do you touch it?

 Capt. G. To make it lighter. See here, little love, I've one notion and
      Jack has another, but we are both agreed that all this equipment is about
      thirty pounds too heavy. The thing is how to cut it down without weakening
      any part of it, and, at the same time, allowing the trooper to carry
      everything he wants for his own comfort—socks and shirts and things
      of that kind.

 Mrs. G. Why doesn't he pack them in a little trunk?

 Capt. G. (Kissing her.) Oh, you darling! Pack them in a little trunk,
      indeed! Hussars don't carry trunks, and it's a most important thing to
      make the horse do all the carrying.

 Mrs. G. But why need you bother about it? You're not a trooper.

 Capt. G. No; but I command a few score of him; and equipment is nearly
      everything in these days.

 Mrs. G. More than me?

 Capt. G. Stupid! Of course not; but it's a matter that I'm tremendously
      interested in, because if I or Jack, or I and Jack, work out some sort of
      lighter saddlery and all that, it's possible that we may get it adopted.

 Mrs. G. How?

 Capt. G. Sanctioned at Home, where they will make a sealed pattern—a
      pattern that all the saddlers must copy—and so it will be used by
      all the regiments.

 Mrs. G. And that interests you?

 Capt. G. It's part of my profession, y'know, and my profession is a good
      deal to me. Everything in a soldier's equipment is important, and if we
      can improve that equipment, so much the better for the soldiers and for
      us.

 Mrs. G. Who's “us”?

 Capt. G. Jack and I; only Jack's notions are too radical. What's that big
      sigh for, Minnie?

 Mrs. G. Oh, nothing—and you've kept all this a secret from me! Why?

 Capt. G. Not a secret, exactly, dear. I didn't say anything about it to
      you because I didn't think it would amuse you.

 Mrs. G. And am I only made to be amused?

 Capt. G. No, of course. I merely mean that it couldn't interest you.

 Mrs. G. It's your work and—and if you'd let me, I'd count all these
      things up. If they are too heavy, you know by how much they are too heavy,
      and you must have a list of things made out to your scale of lightness,
      and—

 Capt. G. I have got both scales somewhere in my head; but it's hard to
      tell how light you can make a head-stall, for instance, until you've
      actually had a model made.

 Mrs. G. But if you read out the list, I could copy it down, and pin it up
      there just above your table. Wouldn't that do?

 Capt. G. It would be awf'ly nice, dear, but it would be giving you trouble
      for nothing. I can't work that way. I go by rule of thumb. I know the
      present scale of weights, and the other one—the one that I'm trying
      to work to—will shift and vary so much that I couldn't be certain,
      even if I wrote it down.

 Mrs. G. I'm so sorry. I thought I might help. Is there anything else that
      I could be of use in?

 Capt. G. (Looking round the room.) I can't think of anything. You're
      always helping me you know.

 Mrs. G. Am I? How?

 Capt. G. You are of course, and as long as you're near me—I can't
      explain exactly, but it's in the air.

 Mrs. G. And that's why you wanted to send me away?

 Capt. G. That's only when I'm trying to do work—grubby work like
      this.

 Mrs. G. Mafflin's better, then, isn't he?

 Capt. G. (Rashly.) Of course he is. Jack and I have been thinking along
      the same groove for two or three years about this equipment. It's our hobby,
      and it may really be useful some day.

 Mrs. G. (After a pause.) And that's all that you have away from me?

 Capt. G. It isn't very far away from you now. Take care the oil on that
      bit doesn't come off on your dress.

 Mrs. G. I wish—I wish so much that I could really help you. I
      believe I could—if I left the room. But that's not what I mean.

 Capt. G. (Aside.) Give me patience! I wish she would go. (Aloud.) I assure
      you you can't do anything for me, Minnie, and I must really settle down to
      this. Where's my pouch?

 Mrs. G. (Crossing to writing-table.) Here you are, Bear. What a mess you
      keep your table in!

 Capt. G. Don' ttouch it. There's a method in my madness, though you
      mightn't think of it.

 Mrs. G. (At table.) I want to look—Do you keep accounts, Pip?

 Capt. G. (Bending over saddlery.) Of a sort. Are you rummaging among the
      Troop papers? Be careful.

 Mrs. G. Why? I sha'n't disturb anything. Good gracious! I had no idea that
      you had anything to do with so many sick horses.

 Capt. G. 'Wish I hadn't, but they insist on falling sick. Minnie, if 1
      were you I really should not investigate those papers. You may come across
      something that you won't like.

 Mrs. G. Why will you always treat me like a child? I know I'm not
      displacing the horrid things.

 Capt. G. (Resignedly.) Very well, then. Don't blame me if anything
      happens. Play with the table and let me go on with the saddlery. (Slipping
      hand into trousers-pocket.) Oh, the deuce!

 Mrs. G. (Her back to G.) What's that for?

 Capt. G. Nothing. (Aside.) There's not much in it, but I wish I'd torn it
      up.

 Mrs. G. (Turning over contents of table.) I know you'll hate me for this;
      but I do want to see what your work is like. (A pause.) Pip, what are
      “farcybuds”?

 Capt. G. Hah! Would you really like to know? They aren't pretty things.

 Mrs. G. This Journal of Veterinary Science says they are of “absorbing
      interest.” Tell me.

 Capt. G. (Aside.) It may turn her attention.

 Gives a long and designedly loathsome account of glanders and farcy.

 Mrs. G. Oh, that's enough. Don't go on!

 Capt. G. But you wanted to know—Then these things suppurate and
      matterate and spread—

 Mrs. G. Pin, you're making me sick! You're a horrid, disgusting schoolboy.

 Capt. G. (On his knees among the bridles.) You asked to be told. It's not
      my fault if you worry me into talking about horrors.

 Mrs. G. Why didn't you say No?

 Capt. G. Good Heavens, child! Have you come in here simply to bully me?

 Mrs. G. I bully you? How could I! You're so strong. (Hysterically.) Strong
      enough to pick me up and put me outside the door and leave me there to
      cry. Aren't you?

 Capt. G. It seems to me that you're an irrational little baby. Are you
      quite well?

 Mrs. G. Do I look ill? (Returning to table). Who is your lady friend with
      the big grey envelope and the fat monogram outside?

 Capt. G. (Aside.) Then it wasn't locked up, confound it. (Aloud.) “God
      made her, therefore let her pass for a woman.” You remember what farcybuds
      are like?

 Mrs. G. (Showing envelope.) This has nothing to do with them. I'm going to
      open it. May I?

 Capt. G. Certainly, if you want to. I'd sooner you didn't though. I don't
      ask to look at your letters to the Deercourt girl.

 Mrs. G. You'd better not, Sir! (Takes letter from envelope.) Now, may I
      look? If you say no, I shall cry.

 Capt. G. You've never cried in my knowledge of you, and I don't believe
      you could.

 Mrs. G. I feel very like it today, Pip. Don't be hard on me. (Reads
      letter.) It begins in the middle, without any “Dear Captain Gadsby,” or
      anything. How funny!

 Capt. G. (Aside.) No, it's not Dear Captain Gadsby, or anything, now. How
      funny!

 Mrs. G. What a strange letter! (Reads.) “And so the moth has come too near
      the candle at last, and has been singed into—shall I say
      Respectability? I congratulate him, and hope he will be as happy as he
      deserves to be.” What does that mean? Is she congratulating you about our
      marriage?

 Capt. G. Yes, I suppose so.

 Mrs. G. (Still reading letter.) She seems to be a particular friend of
      yours.

 Capt. G. Yes. She was an excellent matron of sorts—a Mrs. Herriott—wife
      of a Colonel Herriott. I used to know some of her people at Home long ago—before
      I came out.

 Mrs. G. Some Colonel's wives are young—as young as me. I knew one
      who was younger.

 Capt. G. Then it couldn't have been Mrs. Herriott. She was old enough to
      have been your mother, dear.

 Mrs. G. I remember now. Mrs. Scargill was talking about her at the
      Dutfins' tennis, before you came for me, on Tuesday. Captain Mafflin said
      she was a “dear old woman.” Do you know, I think Mafflin is a very clumsy
      man with his feet.

 Capt. G. (Aside.) Good old Jack! (Aloud.) Why, dear?

 Mrs. G. He had put his cup down on the ground then, and he literally
      stepped into it. Some of the tea spirted over my dress—the grey one.
      I meant to tell you about it before.

 Capt. G. (Aside.) There are the makings of a strategist about Jack though
      his methods are coarse. (Aloud.) You'd better get a new dress, then.
      (Aside.) Let us pray that that will turn her.

 Mrs. G. Oh, it isn't stained in the least. I only thought that I'd tell
      you. (Returning to letter.) What an extraordinary person! (Reads.) “But
      need I remind you that you have taken upon yourself a charge of wardship”—what
      in the world is a charge of wardship?—“which as you yourself know,
      may end in Consequences”—

 Capt. G. (Aside.) It's safest to let em see everything as they come across
      it; but 'seems to me that there are exceptions to the rule. (Aloud.) I
      told you that there was nothing to be gained from rearranging my table.

 Mrs. G. (Absently.) What does the woman mean? She goes on talking about
      Consequences—“almost inevitable Consequences” with a capital C—for
      half a page. (Flushing scarlet.) Oh, good gracious! How abominable!

 Capt. G. (Promptly.) Do you think so? Doesn't it show a sort of motherly
      interest in us? (Aside.) Thank Heaven. Harry always wrapped her meaning up
      safely! (Aloud.) Is it absolutely necessary to go on with the letter,
      darling?

 Mrs. G. It's impertinent—it's simply horrid. What right has this
      woman to write in this way to you? She oughtn't to.

 Capt. G. When you write to the Deercourt girl, I notice that you generally
      fill three or four sheets. Can't you let an old woman babble on paper once
      in a way? She means well.

 Mrs. G. I don't care. She shouldn't write, and if she did, you ought to
      have shown me her letter.

 Capt. G. Can't you understand why I kept it to myself, or must I explain
      at length—as I explained the farcybuds?

 Mrs. G. (Furiously.) Pip I hate you! This is as bad as those idiotic
      saddle-bags on the floor. Never mind whether it would please me or not,
      you ought to have given it to me to read.

 Capt. G. It comes to the same thing. You took it yourself.

 Mrs. G. Yes, but if I hadn't taken it, you wouldn't have said a word. I
      think this Harriet Herriott—it's like a name in a book—is an
      interfering old Thing.

 Capt. G. (Aside.) So long as you thoroughly understand that she is old, I
      don't much care what you think. (Aloud.) Very good, dear. Would you like
      to write and tell her so? She's seven thousand miles away.

 Mrs. G. I don't want to have anything to do with her, but you ought to
      have told me. (Turning to last page of letter.) And she patronizes me,
      too. I've never seen her! (Reads.) “I do not know how the world stands
      with you; in all human probability I shall never know; but whatever I may
      have said before, I pray for her sake more than for yours that all may be
      well. I have learned what misery means, and I dare not wish that any one
      dear to you should share my knowledge.”

 Capt. G. Good God! Can't you leave that letter alone, or, at least, can't
      you refrain from reading it aloud? I've been through it once. Put it back
      on the desk. Do you hear me?

 Mrs. G. (Irresolutely.) I sh-sha'n't! (Looks at G.'s eyes.) Oh, Pip,
      please! I didn't mean to make you angry—'Deed, I didn't. Pip, I'm so
      sorry. I know I've wasted your time—

 Capt. G. (Grimly.) You have. Now, will you be good enough to go—if
      there is nothing more in my room that you are anxious to pry into?

 Mrs. G. (Putting out her hands.) Oh, Pip, don't look at me like that! I've
      never seen you look like that before and it hu-urts me! I'm sorry. I
      oughtn't to have been here at all, and—and—and—(sobbing.)
      Oh, be good to me! Be good to me! There's only you—anywhere! Breaks
      down in long chair, hiding face in cushions.

 Capt. G. (Aside.) She doesn't know how she flicked me on the raw. (Aloud,
      bending over chair.) I didn't mean to be harsh, dear—I didn't
      really. You can stay here as long as you please, and do what you please.
      Don't cry like that. You'll make yourself sick. (Aside.) What on earth has
      come over her? (Aloud.) Darling, what's the matter with you?

 Mrs. G. (Her face still hidden.) Let me go—let me go to my own room.
      Only—only say you aren't angry with me.

 Capt. G. Angry with you, love! Of course not. I was angry with myself. I'd
      lost my temper over the saddlery—Don't hide your face, Pussy. I want
      to kiss it.

 Bends lower, Mrs. G. slides right arm round his neck. Several interludes
      and much sobbing.

 Mrs. G. (In a whisper.) I didn't mean about the jam when I came in to tell
      you— CAPT. G. Bother the jam and the equipment! (Interlude.)

 Mrs. G. (Still more faintly.) My finger wasn't scalded at all. I—wanted
      to speak to you about—about—something else, and—I didn't
      know how.

 Capt. G. Speak away, then. (Looking into her eyes.) Eh! Wha-at? Minnie!
      Here, don't go away! You don't mean?

 Mrs. G. (Hysterically, backing to portiere and hiding her face in its
      folds.) The—the Almost Inevitable Consequences! (Flits through
      portiere as G. attempts to catch her, and bolts her self in her own room.)

 Capt. G. (His arms full of portiere.) Oh! (Sitting down heavily in chair.)
      I'm a brute, a pig—a bully, and a blackguard. My poor, poor little
      darling! “Made to be amused only?”—

  

  









 THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL.

 SCENE. The GADSBYS' bungalow in the Plains, in June. Punkah-coolies asleep
      in veranda where Captain GADSBY is walking up and down. DOCTOR'S trap in
      porch. JUNIOR CHAPLAIN drifting generally and uneasily through the house.
      Time, 3:40 A. M. Heat 94 degrees in veranda.

 DOCTOR. (Coming into veranda and touching G. on the shoulder.) You had
      better go in and see her now.

 Capt. G. (The color of good cigar-ash.) Eh, wha-at? Oh, yes, of course.
      What did you say?

 DOCTOR. (Syllable by syllable.) Go-in-to-the-room-and-see-her. She wants
      to speak to you. (Aside, testily.) I shall have him on my hands next.

 JUNIOR CHAPLAIN. (In half-lighted dining room.) Isn't there any?—

 DOCTOR. (Savagely.) Ha, you little fool!

 JUNIOR CHAPLAIN. Let me do my work. Gadsby, stop a minute—I (Edges
      after G.)

 DOCTOR. Wait till she sends for you at least—at least. Man alive,
      he'll kill you if you go in there! What are you bothering him for?

 JUNIOR CHAPLAIN. (Coming into veranda.) I've given him a stiff brandy-peg.
      He wants it. You've forgotten him for the last ten hours and—forgotten
      yourself too.

 G. enters bedroom, which is lit by one night-lamp. Ayah on the floor
      pretending to be asleep.

 VOICE. (From the bed.) All down the street—such bonfires! Ayah, go
      and put them out! (Appealingly.) How can I sleep with an installation of
      the C.I.E. in my room? No—not C.I.E. Something else. What was it?

 Capt. G. (Trying to control his voice.) Minnie, I'm here. (Bending over
      bed.) Don't you know me, Minnie? It's me—it's Phil—it's your
      husband.

 VOICE. (Mechanically.) It's me—it's Phil—it's your husband.

 Capt. G. She doesn't know me!—It's your own husband, darling.

 VOICE. Your own husband, darling.

 Ayah. (With an inspiration.) Memsahib understanding all I saying.

 Capt. G. Make her understand me then—quick!

 Ayah. (Hand on Mrs. G.'s fore-head.) Memsahib! Captain Sahib here.

 VOICE. Salaem do. (Fretfully.) I know I'm not fit to be seen.

 Ayah. (Aside to G.) Say “marneen” same as breakfash.

 Capt. G. Good morning, little woman. How are we today?

 VOICE. That's Phil. Poor old Phil. (Viciously.) Phil, you fool, I can't
      see you. Come nearer.

 Capt. G. Minnie! Minnie! It's me—you know me?

 VOICE. (Mockingly.) Of course I do. Who does not know the man who was so
      cruel to his wife—almost the only one he ever had?

 Capt. G. Yes, dear. Yes—of course, of course. But won't you speak to
      him? He wants to speak to you so much.

 VOICE. They'd never let him in. The Doctor would give darwaza band even if
      he were in the house. He'll never come. (Despairingly.) O Judas! Judas!
      Judas!

 Capt. G. (Putting out his arms.) They have let him in, and he always was
      in the house Oh, my love—don't you know me?

 VOICE. (In a half chant.) “And it came to pass at the eleventh hour that
      this poor soul repented.” It knocked at the gates, but they were shut—tight
      as a plaster—a great, burning plaster. They had pasted our marriage
      certificate all across the door, and it was made of red-hot iron—people
      really ought to be more careful, you know.

 Capt. G. What am I to do? (Taking her in his arms.) Minnie! speak to me—to
      Phil.

 VOICE. What shall I say? Oh, tell me what to say before it's too late!
      They are all going away and I can't say anything.

 Capt. G. Say you know me! Only say you know me!

 DOCTOR. (Who has entered quietly.) For pity's sake don't take it too much
      to heart, Gadsby. It's this way sometimes. They won't recognize. They say
      all sorts of queer things—don't you see?

 Capt. G. All right! All right! Go away now; she'll recognize me; you're
      bothering her. She must—mustn't she?

 DOCTOR. She will before—Have I your leave to try?—

 Capt. G. Anything you please, so long as she'll know me. It's only a
      question of hours, isn't it?

 DOCTOR. (Professionally.) While there's life there's hope y'know. But
      don't build on it.

 Capt. G. I don't. Pull her together if it's possible. (Aside.) What have I
      done to deserve this?

 DOCTOR. (Bending over bed.) Now, Mrs. Gadsby! We shall be all right
      tomorrow. You must take it, or I sha'n't let Phil see you. It isn't nasty,
      is it?

 Voice. Medicines! Always more medicines! Can't you leave me alone?

 Capt. G. Oh, leave her in peace, Doc!

 DOCTOR. (Stepping back,—aside.) May I be forgiven if I've done
      wrong. (Aloud.) In a few minutes she ought to be sensible; but I daren't
      tell you to look for anything. It's only—

 Capt. G. What? Go on, man.

 DOCTOR. (In a whisper.) Forcing the last rally.

 Capt. G. Then leave us alone.

 DOCTOR. Don't mind what she says at first, if you can. They—they—they
      turn against those they love most sometimes in this.—It's hard, but—

 Capt. G. Am I her husband or are you? Leave us alone for what time we have
      together.

 VOICE. (Confidentially.) And we were engaged quite suddenly, Emma. I
      assure you that I never thought of it for a moment; but, oh, my little Me!—I
      don't know what I should have done if he hadn't proposed.

 Capt. G. She thinks of that Deercourt girl before she thinks of me.
      (Aloud.) Minnie!

 VOICE. Not from the shops, Mummy dear. You can get the real leaves from
      Kaintu, and (laughing weakly) never mind about the blossoms—Dead
      white silk is only fit for widows, and I won't wear it. It's as bad as a
      winding sheet. (A long pause.)

 Capt. G. I never asked a favor yet. If there is anybody to listen to me,
      let her know me—even if I die too!

 VOICE. (Very faintly.) Pip, Pip dear.

 Capt. G. I'm here, darling.

 VOICE. What has happened? They've been bothering me so with medicines and
      things, and they wouldn't let you come and see me. I was never ill before.
      Am I ill now?

 Capt. G. You—you aren't quite well.

 VOICE. How funny! Have I been ill long?

 Capt. G. Some days; but you'll be all right in a little time.

 VOICE. Do you think so, Pip? I don't feel well and—Oh! what have
      they done to my hair?

 Capt. G. I d-d-on't know.

 VOICE. They've cut it off. What a shame!

 Capt. G. It must have been to make your head cooler.

 VOICE. Just like a boy's wig. Don't I look horrid?

 Capt. G. Never looked prettier in your life, dear. (Aside.) How am I to
      ask her to say goodbye?

 VOICE. I don't feel pretty. I feel very ill. My heart won't work. It's
      nearly dead inside me, and there's a funny feeling in my eyes. Everything
      seems the same distance—you and the almirah and the table inside my
      eyes or miles away. What does it mean, Pip?

 Capt. G. You're a little feverish, Sweetheart—very feverish.
      (Breaking down.) My love! my love! How can I let you go?

 VOICE. I thought so. Why didn't you tell me that at first?

 Capt. G. What?

 VOICE. That I am going to—die.

 Capt. G. But you aren't! You sha'n't.

 Ayah to punkah-coolie. (Stepping into veranda after a glance at the bed.
      ). Punkah chor do! (Stop pulling the punkah.)

 VOICE. It's hard, Pip. So very, very hard after one year—just one
      year. (Wailing.) And I'm only twenty. Most girls aren't even married at
      twenty. Can't they do anything to help me? I don't want to die.

 Capt. G. Hush, dear. You won't.

 VOICE. What's the use of talking? Help me! You've never failed me yet. Oh,
      Phil, help me to keep alive. (Feverishly.) I don't believe you wish me to
      live. You weren't a bit sorry when that horrid Baby thing died. I wish I'd
      killed it!

 Capt. G. (Drawing his hand across his forehead.) It's more than a man's
      meant to bear—it's not right. (Aloud.) Minnie, love, I'd die for you
      if it would help.

 VOICE. No more death. There's enough already. Pip, don't you die too.

 Capt. G. I wish I dared.

 VOICE. It says: “Till Death do us part.” Nothing after that—and so
      it would be no use. It stops at the dying. Why does it stop there? Only
      such a very short life, too. Pip, I'm sorry we married.

 Capt. G. No! Anything but that, Min!

 VOICE. Because you'll forget and I'll forget. Oh, Pip, don't forget! I
      always loved you, though I was cross sometimes. If I ever did anything
      that you didn't like, say you forgive me now.

 Capt. G. You never did, darling. On my soul and honor you never did. I
      haven't a thing to forgive you.

 VOICE. I sulked for a whole week about those petunias. (With a laugh.)
      What a little wretch I was, and how grieved you were! Forgive me that, Pp.

 Capt. G. There's nothing to forgive. It was my fault. They were too near
      the drive. For God's sake don't talk so, Minnie! There's such a lot to say
      and so little time to say it in.

 VOICE. Say that you'll always love me—until the end.

 Capt. G. Until the end. (Carried away.) It's a lie. It must be, because
      we've loved each other. This isn't the end.

 VOICE. (Relapsing into semi-delirium.) My Church-service has an ivory
      cross on the back, and it says so, so it must be true. “Till Death do us
      part.”—but that's a lie. (With a parody of G.'s manner.) A damned
      lie! (Recklessly.) Yes, I can swear as well as a Trooper, Pip. I can't
      make my head think, though. That's because they cut off my hair. How can
      one think with one's head all fuzzy? (Pleadingly.) Hold me, Pip! Keep me
      with you always and always. (Relapsing.) But if you marry the Thorniss
      girl when I'm dead, I'll come back and howl under our bedroom window all
      night. Oh, bother! You'll think I'm a jackal. Pip, what time is it?

 Capt. G. A little before the dawn, dear.

 VOICE. I wonder where I shall be this time tomorrow?

 Capt. G. Would you like to see the Padre?

 VOICE. Why should I? He'd tell me that I am going to heaven; and that
      wouldn't be true, because you are here. Do you recollect when he upset the
      cream-ice all over his trousers at the Gassers' tennis?

 Capt. G. Yes, dear.

 VOICE. I often wondered whether he got another pair of trousers; but then
      his are so shiny all over that you really couldn't tell unless you were
      told. Let's call him in and ask.

 Capt. G. (Gravely.) No. I don't think he'd like that. Your head comfy,
      Sweetheart?

 VOICE. (Faintly with a sigh of contentment.) Yeth! Gracious, Pip, when did
      you shave last? Your chin's worse than the barrel of a musical box.—No,
      don't lift it up. I like it. (A pause.) You said you've never cried at
      all. You're crying all over my cheek.

 Capt. G. I-I-I can't help it, dear.

 VOICE. How funny! I couldn't cry now to save my life. (G. shivers.) I want
      to sing.

 Capt. G. Won't it tire you? 'Better not, perhaps.

 VOICE. Why? I won't be bothered about. (Begins in a hoarse quaver)

 “Minnie bakes oaten cake, Minnie brews ale,
 All because her Johnnie's coming home from the sea.” (That's parade, Pip.)
 “And she grows red as a rose, who was so pale;
 And 'Are you sure the church-clock goes?' says she.”

 (Pettishly.) I knew I couldn't take the last note. How do the bass chords
      run? (Puts out her hands and begins playing piano on the sheet.)

 Capt. G. (Catching up hands.) Ahh! Don't do that, Pussy, if you love me.

 VOICE. Love you? Of course I do. Who else should it be? (A pause.)

 VOICE. (Very clearly.) Pip, I'm going now. Something's choking me cruelly.
      (Indistinctly.) Into the dark—without you, my heart—But it's a
      lie, dear—we mustn't believe it.—Forever and ever, living or
      dead. Don't let me go, my husband—hold me tight.—They can't—whatever
      happens. (A cough.) Pip—my Pip! Not for always—and—so—soon!
      (Voice ceases.)

 Pause of ten minutes. G. buries his face in the side of the bed while AYAH
      bends over bed from opposite side and feels Mrs. G.'s breast and forehead.

 Capt. G. (Rising.) Doctor Sahib ko salaam do.

 Ayah. (Still by bedside, with a shriek.) Ail Ail Tuta-phuta! My Memsahib!
      Not getting—not have got!—Pusseena agyal (The sweat has come.)
      (Fiercely to G.) TUM jao Doctor Sahib ko jaldi! (You go to the doctor.)
      Oh, my Memsahib!

 DOCTOR. (Entering hastily.) Come away, Gadsby. (Bends over bed.) Eh! The
      Dev—What inspired you to stop the punkah? Get out, man—go away—wait
      outside! Go! Here, Ayah! (Over his shoulder to G.) Mind I promise nothing.

 The dawn breaks as G. stumbles into the garden.

 Capt. M. (Rehung up at the gate on his way to parade and very soberly.)
      Old man, how goes?

 Capt. G. (Dazed.) I don't quite know. Stay a bit. Have a drink or
      something. Don't run away. You're just getting amusing. Ha! ha!

 Capt. M. (Aside.) What am I let in for? Gaddy has aged ten years in the
      night.

 Capt. G. (Slowly, fingering charger's headstall.) Your curb's too loose.

 Capt. M. So it is. Put it straight, will you? (Aside.) I shall be late for
      parade. Poor Gaddy.

 Capt. G. links and unlinks curb-chain aimlessly, and finally stands
      staring toward the veranda. The day brightens.

 DOCTOR. (Knocked out of professional gravity, tramping across flower-beds
      and shaking G's hands.) It'-it's-it's!—Gadsby, there's a fair chance—a
      dashed fair chance. The flicker, y'know. The sweat, y'know I saw how it
      would be. The punkah, y'know. Deuced clever woman that Ayah of yours.
      Stopped the punkah just at the right time. A dashed good chance! No—you
      don't go in. We'll pull her through yet I promise on my reputation—under
      Providence. Send a man with this note to Bingle. Two heads better than
      one. 'Specially the Ayah! We'll pull her round. (Retreats hastily to
      house.)

 Capt. G. (His head on neck of M.'s charger.) Jack! I bub-bu-believe, I'm
      going to make a bu-bub-bloody exhibitiod of byself.

 Capt. M. (Sniffing openly and feeling in his left cuff.) I b-b-believe,
      I'b doing it already. Old bad, what cad I say? I'b as pleased as—Cod
      dab you, Gaddy! You're one big idiot and I'b adother. (Pulling himself
      together.) Sit tight! Here comes the Devil-dodger.

 JUNIOR CHAPLAIN. (Who is not in the Doctor's confidence.) We—we are
      only men in these things, Gadsby. I know that I can say nothing now to
      help.

 Capt. M. (jealously.) Then don't say it Leave him alone. It's not bad
      enough to croak over. Here, Gaddy, take the chit to Bingle and ride
      hell-for-leather. It'll do you good. I can't go.

 JUNIOR CHAPLAIN. Do him good! (Smiling.) Give me the chit and I'll drive.
      Let him lie down. Your horse is blocking my cart—please!

 Capt. M. (Slowly without reining back.) I beg your pardon—I'll
      apologize. On paper if you like.

 JUNIOR CHAPLAIN. (Flicking M.'s charger.) That'll do, thanks. Turn in,
      Gadsby, and I'll bring Bingle back—ahem—“hell-for-leather.”

 Capt. M. (Solus.) It would have served me right if he'd cut me across the
      face. He can drive too. I shouldn't care to go that pace in a bamboo cart.
      What a faith he must have in his Maker—of harness! Come hup, you
      brute! (Gallops off to parade, blowing his nose, as the sun rises.)

 (INTERVAL OF FIVE WEEKS.)

 Mrs. G. (Very white and pinched, in morning wrapper at breakfast table.)
      How big and strange the room looks, and how glad I am to see it again!
      What dust, though! I must talk to the servants. Sugar, Pip? I've almost
      forgotten. (Seriously.) Wasn't I very ill?

 Capt. G. Iller than I liked. (Tenderly.) Oh, you bad little Pussy, what a
      start you gave me!

 Mrs. G. I'll never do it again.

 Capt. G. You'd better not. And now get those poor pale cheeks pink again,
      or I shall be angry. Don't try to lift the urn. You'll upset it. Wait.
      (Comes round to head of table and lifts urn.)

 Mrs. G. (Quickly.) Khitmatgar, howarchikhana see kettly lao. Butler, get a
      kettle from the cook-house. (Drawing down G.'s face to her own.) Pip dear,
      I remember.

 Capt. G. What?

 Mrs. G. That last terrible night.

 CAPT. G. Then just you forget all about it.

 Mrs. G. (Softly, her eyes filling.) Never. It has brought us very close
      together, my husband. There! (Interlude.) I'm going to give Junda a saree.

 Capt. G. I gave her fifty dibs.

 Mrs. G. So she told me. It was a 'normous reward. Was I worth it? (Several
      interludes.) Don't! Here's the khitmatgar.—Two lumps or one Sir?

  

  









 THE SWELLING OF JORDAN

 If thou hast run with the footmen and they have wearied thee, then how
      canst thou contend with horses? And if in the land of peace wherein thou
      trustedst they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of
      Jordan?

 SCENE. The GADSBYS' bungalow in the Plains, on a January morning. Mrs. G.
      arguing with bearer in back veranda.

 Capt. M. rides up.

 Capt. M. 'Mornin', Mrs. Gadsby. How's the Infant Phenomenon and the Proud
      Proprietor?

 Mrs. G. You'll find them in the front veranda; go through the house. I'm
      Martha just now.

 Capt. M, 'Cumbered about with cares of Khitmatgars? I fly.

 Passes into front veranda, where GADSBV is watching GADSBY JUNIOR, aged
      ten months, crawling about the matting.

 Capt. M. What's the trouble, Gaddy-spoiling an honest man's Europe morning
      this way? (Seeing G. JUNIOR.) By Jove, that yearling's comin' on
      amazingly! Any amount of bone below the knee there.

 Capt. G. Yes, he's a healthy little scoundrel. Don't you think his hair's
      growing?

 Capt. M. Let's have a look. Hi! Hst Come here, General Luck, and we'll
      report on you.

 Mrs. G. (Within.) What absurd name will you give him next? Why do you call
      him that?

 Capt. M. Isn't he our Inspector-General of Cavalry? Doesn't he come down
      in his seventeen-two perambulator every morning the Pink Hussars parade?
      Don't wriggle, Brigadier. Give us your private opinion on the way the
      third squadron went past. 'Trifle ragged, weren't they?

 Capt. G. A bigger set of tailors than the new draft I don't wish to see.
      They've given me more than my fair share—knocking the squadron out
      of shape. It's sickening!

 Capt. M. When you're in command, you'll do better, young 'un. Can'tyou
      walk yet? Grip my finger and try. (To G.) 'Twon't hurt his hocks, will it?

 Capt. G. Oh, no. Don't let him flop, though, or he'll lick all the
      blacking off your boots.

 Mrs. G. (Within.) Who's destroying my son's character?

 Capt. M. And my Godson's. I'm ashamed of you, Gaddy. Punch your father in
      the eye, Jack! Don't you stand it! Hit him again!

 Capt. G. (Sotto voce.) Put The Butcha down and come to the end of the
      veranda. I'd rather the Wife didn't hear—just now.

 Capt. M. You look awf'ly serious. Anything wrong?

 Capt. G. 'Depends on your view entirely. I say, Jack, you won't think more
      hardly of me than you can help, will you? Come further this way.—The
      fact of the matter is, that I've made up my mind—at least I'm
      thinking seriously of—cutting the Service.

 Capt. M. Hwhatt?

 Capt. G. Don't shout. I'm going to send in my papers.

 Capt. M. You! Are you mad?

 Capt. G. No—only married.

 Capt. M. Look here! What's the meaning of it all? You never intend to
      leave us. You can't. Isn't the best squadron of the best regiment of the
      best cavalry in all the world good enough for you?

 Capt. G. (Jerking his head over his shoulder.) She doesn't seem to thrive
      in this God-forsaken country, and there's The Butcha to be considered and
      all that, you know.

 Capt. M. Does she say that she doesn't like India?

 Capt. G. That's the worst of it. She won't for fear of leaving me.

 Capt. M. What are the Hills made for?

 Capt. G. Not for my wife, at any rate.

 Capt. M. You know too much, Gaddy, and—I don't like you any the
      better for it!

 Capt. G. Never mind that. She wants England, and The Butcha would be all
      the better for it. I'm going to chuck. You don't understand.

 Capt. M. (Hotly.) I understand this!—One hundred and thirty-seven
      new horse to be licked into shape somehow before Luck comes round again; a
      hairy-heeled draft who'll give more trouble than the horses; a camp next
      cold weather for a certainty; ourselves the first on the roster; the
      Russian shindy ready to come to a head at five minutes' notice, and you,
      the best of us all, backing out of it all! Think a little, Gaddy. You
      won't do it.

 Capt. G. Hang it, a man has some duties toward his family, I suppose.

 Capt. M. I remember a man, though, who told me, the night after Amdheran,
      when we were picketed under Jagai, and he'd left his sword—by the
      way, did you ever pay Ranken for that sword?—in an Utmanzai's head—that
      man told me that he'd stick by me and the Pinks as long as he lived. I
      don't blame him for not sticking by me—I'm not much of a man—but
      I do blame him for not sticking by the Pink Hussars.

 Capt. G. (Uneasily.) We were little more than boys then. Can't you see,
      Jack, how things stand? 'Tisn't as if we were serving for our bread. We've
      all of us, more or less, got the filthy lucre. I'm luckier than some,
      perhaps. There's no call for me to serve on.

 Capt. M. None in the world for you or for us, except the Regimental. If
      you don't choose to answer to that, of course—

 Capt. G. Don't be too hard on a man. You know that a lot of us only take
      up the thing for a few years and then go back to Town and catch on with
      the rest.

 Capt. M. Not lots, and they aren't some of Us.

 Capt. G. And then there are one's affairs at Home to be considered—my
      place and the rents, and all that. I don't suppose my father can last much
      longer, and that means the title, and so on.

 Capt. M. 'Fraid you won't be entered in the Stud Book correctly unless you
      go Home? Take six months, then, and come out in October. If I could slay
      off a brother or two, I s'pose I should be a Marquis of sorts. Any fool
      can be that; but it needs men, Gaddy—men like you—to lead
      flanking squadrons properly. Don't you delude yourself into the belief
      that you're going Home to take your place and prance about among
      pink-nosed Kabuli dowagers. You aren't built that way. I know better.

 Capt. G. A man has a right to live his life as happily as he can. You
      aren't married.

 Capt. M. No—praise be to Providence and the one or two women who
      have had the good sense to jawab me.

 Capt. G. Then you don't know what it is to go into your own room and see
      your wife's head on the pillow, and when everything else is safe and the
      house shut up for the night, to wonder whether the roof-beams won't give
      and kill her.

 Capt. M. (Aside.) Revelations first and second! (Aloud.) So-o! I knew a
      man who got squiffy at our Mess once and confided to me that he never
      helped his wife on to her horse without praying that she'd break her neck
      before she came back. All husbands aren't alike, you see.

 Capt. G. What on earth has that to do with my case? The man must ha' been
      mad, or his wife as bad as they make 'em.

 Capt. M. (Aside.) 'No fault of yours if either weren't all you say. You've
      forgotten the time when you were insane about the Herriott woman. You
      always were a good hand at forgetting. (Aloud.) Not more mad than men who
      go to the other extreme. Be reasonable, Gaddy. Your roof-beams are sound
      enough.

 Capt. G. That was only a way of speaking. I've been uneasy and worried
      about the Wife ever since that awful business three years ago—when—I
      nearly lost her. Can you wonder?

 Capt. M. Oh, a shell never falls twice in the same place. You've paid your
      toll to misfortune—why should your Wife be picked out more than
      anybody else's?

 Capt. G. I can talk just as reasonably as you can, but you don't
      understand—you don't understand. And then there's The Butcha. Deuce
      knows where the Ayah takes him to sit in the evening! He has a bit of a
      cough. Haven't you noticed it?

 Capt. M. Bosh! The Brigadier's jumping out of his skin with pure
      condition. He's got a muzzle like a rose-leaf and the chest of a
      two-year-old. What's demoralized you?

 Capt. G. Funk. That's the long and the short of it. Funk!

 Capt. M. But what is there to funk?

 Capt. G. Everything. It's ghastly.

 Capt. M. Ah! I see. You don't want to fight, And by Jingo when we do,
 You've got the kid, you've got the Wife,
 You've got the money, too.
That's about the case, eh?

 Capt. G. I suppose that's it. But it's not for myself. It's because of
      them. At least I think it is.

 Capt. M. Are you sure? Looking at the matter in a cold-blooded light, the
      Wife is provided for even if you were wiped out tonight. She has an
      ancestral home to go to, money and the Brigadier to carry on the
      illustrious name.

 Capt. G. Then it is for myself or because they are part of me. You don't
      see it. My life's so good, so pleasant, as it is, that I want to make it
      quite safe. Can't you understand?

 Capt. M. Perfectly. “Shelter-pit for the Off'cer's charger,” as they say
      in the Line.

 Capt. G. And I have everything to my hand to make it so. I'm sick of the
      strain and the worry for their sakes out here; and there isn't a single
      real difficulty to prevent my dropping it altogether. It'll only cost me—Jack,
      I hope you'll never know the shame that I've been going through for the
      past six months.

 Capt. M. Hold on there! I don't wish to be told. Every man has his moods
      and tenses sometimes.

 Capt. G. (Laughing bitterly.) Has he? What do you call craning over to see
      where your near-fore lands?

 Capt. M. In my case it means that I have been on the Considerable Bend,
      and have come to parade with a Head and a Hand. It passes in three
      strides.

 Capt. G. (Lowering voice.) It never passes with me, Jack. I'm always
      thinking about it. Phil Gadsby funking a fall on parade! Sweet picture,
      isn't it! Draw it for me.

 Capt. M. (Gravely.) Heaven forbid! A man like you can't be as bad as that.
      A fall is no nice thing, but one never gives it a thought.

 Capt. G. Doesn't one? Wait till you've got a wife and a youngster of your
      own, and then you'll know how the roar of the squadron behind you turns
      you cold all up the back.

 Capt. M. (Aside.) And this man led at Amdheran after Bagal Deasin went
      under, and we were all mixed up together, and he came out of the snow
      dripping like a butcher. (Aloud.) Skittles! The men can always open out,
      and you can always pick your way more or less. We haven't the dust to
      bother us, as the men have, and whoever heard of a horse stepping on a
      man?

 Capt. G. Never—as long as he can see. But did they open out for poor
      Errington?

 Capt. M. Oh, this is childish!

 Capt. G. I know it is, worse than that. I don't care. You've ridden Van
      Loo. Is he the sort of brute to pick his way—'specially when we're
      coming up in column of troop with any pace on?

 Capt. M. Once in a Blue Moon do we gallop in column of troop, and then
      only to save time. Aren't three lengths enough for you?

 Capt. G. Yes—quite enough. They just allow for the full development
      of the smash. I'm talking like a cur, I know: but I tell you that, for the
      past three months, I've felt every hoof of the squadron in the small of my
      back every time that I've led.

 Capt. M. But, Gaddy, this is awful!

 Capt. G. Isn't it lovely? Isn't it royal? A Captain of the Pink Hussars
      watering up his charger before parade like the blasted boozing Colonel of
      a Black Regiment!

 Capt. M. You never did!

 Capt. G. Once only. He squelched like a mussuck, and the
      Troop-Sergeant-Major cocked his eye at me. You know old Haffy's eye. I was
      afraid to do it again.

 Capt. M. I should think so. That was the best way to rupture old Van Loo's
      tummy, and make him crumple you up. You knew that.

 Capt. G. I didn't care. It took the edge off him.

 Capt. M. “Took the edge off him”? Gaddy, you—you—you mustn't,
      you know! Think of the men.

 Capt. G. That's another thing I am afraid of. D'you s'pose they know?

 Capt. M. Let's hope not; but they're deadly quick to spot skirm—little
      things of that kind. See here, old man, send the Wife Home for the hot
      weather and come to Kashmir with me. We'll start a boat on the Dal or
      cross the Rhotang—shoot ibex or loaf—which you please. Only
      come! You're a bit off your oats and you're talking nonsense. Look at the
      Colonel—swag-bellied rascal that he is. He has a wife and no end of
      a bow-window of his own. Can any one of us ride round him—chalkstones
      and all? I can't, and I think I can shove a crock along a bit.

 Capt. G. Some men are different. I haven't any nerve. Lord help me, I
      haven't the nerve! I've taken up a hole and a half to get my knees well
      under the wallets. I can't help it. I'm so afraid of anything happening to
      me. On my soul, I ought to be broke in front of the squadron, for
      cowardice.

 Capt. M. Ugly word, that. I should never have the courage to own up.

 Capt. G. I meant to lie about my reasons when I began, but—I've got
      out of the habit of lying to you, old man. Jack, you won't?—But I
      know you won't.

 Capt. M. Of course not. (Half aloud.) The Pinks are paying dearly for
      their Pride.

 Capt. G. Eh! Wha-at?

 Capt. M. Don't you know? The men have called Mrs. Gadsby the Pride of the
      Pink Hussars ever since she came to us.

 Capt. G. 'Tisn't her fault. Don't think that. It's all mine.

 Capt. M. What does she say?

 Capt. G. I haven't exactly put it before her. She's the best little woman
      in the world, Jack, and all that—but she wouldn't counsel a man to
      stick to his calling if it came between him and her. At least, I think—

 Capt. M. Never mind. Don't tell her what you told me. Go on the Peerage
      and Landed-Gentry tack.

 Capt. G. She'd see through it. She's five times cleverer than I am.

 Capt. M. (Aside.) Then she'll accept the sacrifice and think a little bit
      worse of him for the rest of her days.

 Capt. G. (Absently.) I say, do you despise me?

 Capt. M. 'Queer way of putting it. Have you ever been asked that question?
      Think a minute. What answer used you to give?

 Capt. G. So bad as that? I'm not entitled to expect anything more, but
      it's a bit hard when one's best friend turns round and—

 Capt. M. So I have found. But you will have consolations—Bailiffs
      and Drains and Liquid Manure and the Primrose League, and, perhaps, if
      you're lucky, the Colonelcy of a Yeomanry Cav-al-ry Regiment—all
      uniform and no riding, I believe. How old are you?

 Capt. G. Thirty-three. I know it's—

 Capt. M. At forty you'll be a fool of a J. P. landlord. At fifty you'll
      own a bath-chair, and The Brigadier, if he takes after you, will be
      fluttering the dovecotes of—what's the particular dunghill you're
      going to? Also, Mrs. Gadsby will be fat.

 Capt. G. (Limply.) This is rather more than a joke.

 Capt. M. D'you think so? Isn't cutting the Service a joke? It generally
      takes a man fifty years to arrive at it. You're quite right, though. It is
      more than a joke. You've managed it in thirty-three.

 Capt. G. Don't make me feel worse than I do. Will it satisfy you if I own
      that I am a shirker, a skrim-shanker, and a coward?

 Capt. M. It will not, because I'm the only man in the world who can talk
      to you like this without being knocked down. You mustn't take all that
      I've said to heart in this way. I only spoke—a lot of it at least—out
      of pure selfishness, because, because—Oh, damn it all, old man,—I
      don't know what I shall do without you. Of course, you've got the money
      and the place and all that—and there are two very good reasons why
      you should take care of yourself.

 Capt. G. 'Doesn't make it any sweeter. I'm backing out—I know I am.
      I always had a soft drop in me somewhere—and I daren't risk any
      danger to them.

 Capt. M. Why in the world should you? You're bound to think of your family—bound
      to think. Er—hmm. If I wasn't a younger son I'd go too—be shot
      if I wouldn't!

 Capt. G. Thank you, Jack. It's a kind lie, but it's the blackest you've
      told for some time. I know what I'm doing, and I'm going into it with my
      eyes open. Old man, I can't help it. What would you do if you were in my
      place?

 Capt. M. (Aside.) 'Couldn't conceive any woman getting permanently between
      me and the Regiment. (Aloud.) 'Can't say. 'Very likely I should do no
      better. I'm sorry for you—awf'ly sorry—but “if them's your
      sentiments,” I believe, I really do, that you are acting wisely.

 Capt. G. Do you? I hope you do. (In a whisper.) Jack, be very sure of
      yourself before you marry. I'm an ungrateful ruffian to say this, but
      marriage—even as good a marriage as mine has been—hampers a
      man's work, it cripples his sword-arm, and oh, it plays Hell with his
      notions of duty. Sometimes—good and sweet as she is—sometimes
      I could wish that I had kept my freedom—No, I don't mean that
      exactly.

 Mrs. G. (Coming down veranda.) What are you wagging your head over, Pip?

 Capt. M. (Turning quickly.) Me, as usual. The old sermon. Your husband is
      recommending me to get married. 'Never saw such a one-ideaed man.

 Mrs. G. Well, why don't you? I dare say you would make some woman very
      happy.

 Capt. G. There's the Law and the Prophets, Jack. Never mind the Regiment.
      Make a woman happy. (Aside.) O Lord!

 Capt. M. We'll see. I must be off to make a Troop Cook desperately
      unhappy. I won't have the wily Hussar fed on Government Bullock Train
      shinbones—(Hastily.) Surely black ants can't be good for The
      Brigadier. He's picking em off the matting and eating 'em. Here, Senor
      Comandante Don Grubbynose, come and talk to me. (Lifts G. JUNIOR in his
      arms.) 'Want my watch? You won't be able to put it into your mouth, but
      you can try. (G. JUNIOR drops watch, breaking dial and hands.)

 Mrs. G. Oh, Captain Mafflin, I am so sorry! Jack, you bad, bad little
      villain. Ahhh!

 Capt. M. It's not the least consequence, I assure you. He'd treat the
      world in the same way if he could get it into his hands. Everything's made
      to be played, with and broken, isn't it, young 'un?

  Mrs. G. Mafflin didn't at all like his watch being broken, though he was
      too polite to say so. It was entirely his fault for giving it to the
      child. Dem little puds are werry, werry feeble, aren't dey, by
      Jack-in-de-box? (To G.) What did he want to see you for?

 Capt. G. Regimental shop as usual.

 Mrs. G. The Regiment! Always the Regiment. On my word, I sometimes feel
      jealous of Mafflin.

 Capt. G. (Wearily.) Poor old Jack? I don't think you need. Isn't it time
      for The Butcha to have his nap? Bring a chair out here, dear. I've got
      some thing to talk over with you.

 THIS IS THE END OF THE STORY OF THE GADSBYS
