<h2>OUR NEW NEIGHBORS AT PONKAPOG</h2>

<h3>BY THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH</h3>


<p>When I saw the little house building, an eighth of a mile beyond my own,
on the Old Bay Road, I wondered who were to be the tenants. The modest
structure was set well back from the road, among the trees, as if the
inmates were to care nothing whatever for a view of the stylish
equipages which sweep by during the summer season. For my part, I like
to see the passing, in town or country; but each has his own
unaccountable taste. The proprietor, who seemed to be also the architect
of the new house, superintended the various details of the work with an
assiduity that gave me a high opinion of his intelligence and executive
ability, and I congratulated myself on the prospect of having some very
agreeable neighbors.</p>

<p>It was quite early in the spring, if I remember, when they moved into
the cottage&mdash;a newly married couple, evidently: the wife very young,
pretty, and with the air of a lady; the husband somewhat older, but
still in the first flush of manhood. It was understood in the village
that they came from Baltimore; but no one knew them personally, and they
brought no letters of introduction. (For obvious reasons, I refrain from
mentioning names.) It was clear that, for the present at least, their
own company was entirely sufficient for them. They made no advance
toward the acquaintance of any of the families in the neighborhood, and
consequently were left to themselves. That, apparently, was what they
desired, and why<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span> they came to Ponkapog. For after its black bass and
wild duck and teal, solitude is the chief staple of Ponkapog. Perhaps
its perfect rural loveliness should be included. Lying high up under the
wing of the Blue Hills, and in the odorous breath of pines and cedars,
it chances to be the most enchanting bit of unlaced disheveled country
within fifty miles of Boston, which, moreover, can be reached in half an
hour's ride by railway. But the nearest railway station (Heaven be
praised!) is two miles distant, and the seclusion is without a flaw.
Ponkapog has one mail a day; two mails a day would render the place
uninhabitable.</p>

<p>The village&mdash;it looks like a compact village at a distance, but unravels
and disappears the moment you drive into it&mdash;has quite a large floating
population. I do not allude to the perch and pickerel in Ponkapog Pond.
Along the Old Bay Road, a highway even in the Colonial days, there are a
number of attractive villas and cottages straggling off toward Milton,
which are occupied for the summer by people from the city. These birds
of passage are a distinct class from the permanent inhabitants, and the
two seldom closely assimilate unless there has been some previous
connection. It seemed to me that our new neighbors were to come under
the head of permanent inhabitants; they had built their own house, and
had the air of intending to live in it all the year round.</p>

<p>"Are you not going to call on them?" I asked my wife one morning.</p>

<p>"When they call on <i>us</i>," she replied lightly.</p>

<p>"But it is our place to call first, they being strangers."</p>

<p>This was said as seriously as the circumstance demanded; but my wife
turned it off with a laugh, and I said no more, always trusting to her
intuitions in these matters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p>

<p>She was right. She would not have been received, and a cool "Not at
home" would have been a bitter social pill to us if we had gone out of
our way to be courteous.</p>

<p>I saw a great deal of our neighbors, nevertheless. Their cottage lay
between us and the post-office&mdash;where <i>he</i> was never to be met with by
any chance&mdash;and I caught frequent glimpses of the two working in the
garden. Floriculture did not appear so much an object as exercise.
Possibly it was neither; maybe they were engaged in digging for
specimens of those arrowheads and flint hatchets, which are continually
coming to the surface hereabouts. There is scarcely an acre in which the
plowshare has not turned up some primitive stone weapon or domestic
utensil, disdainfully left to us by the red men who once held this
domain&mdash;an ancient tribe called the Punkypoags, a forlorn descendant of
which, one Polly Crowd, figures in the annual Blue Book, down to the
close of the Southern war, as a state pensioner. At that period she
appears to have struck a trail to the Happy Hunting Grounds. I quote
from the local historiographer.</p>

<p>Whether they were developing a kitchen garden, or emulating Professor
Schliemann, at Mycen&aelig;, the newcomers were evidently persons of refined
musical taste: the lady had a contralto voice of remarkable sweetness,
although of no great compass, and I used often to linger of a morning by
the high gate and listen to her executing an arietta, conjecturally at
some window upstairs, for the house was not visible from the turnpike.
The husband, somewhere about the ground, would occasionally respond with
two or three bars. It was all quite an ideal, Arcadian business. They
seemed very happy together, these two persons, who asked no odds
whatever of the community in which they had settled themselves.</p>

<p>There was a queerness, a sort of mystery, about this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span> couple which I
admit piqued my curiosity, though as a rule I have no morbid interest in
the affairs of my neighbors. They behaved like a pair of lovers who had
run off and got married clandestinely. I willingly acquitted them,
however, of having done anything unlawful; for, to change a word in the
lines of the poet,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It is a joy to <i>think</i> the best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We may of human kind."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Admitting the hypothesis of elopement, there was no mystery in their
neither sending nor receiving letters. But where did they get their
groceries? I do not mean the money to pay for them&mdash;that is an enigma
apart&mdash;but the groceries themselves. No express wagon, no butcher's
cart, no vehicle of any description, was ever observed to stop at their
domicile. Yet they did not order family stores at the sole establishment
in the village&mdash;an inexhaustible little bottle of a shop which, I
advertise it gratis, can turn out anything in the way of groceries, from
a hand-saw to a pocket-handkerchief. I confess that I allowed this
unimportant detail of their <i>m&eacute;nage</i> to occupy more of my speculation
than was creditable to me.</p>

<p>In several respects our neighbors reminded me of those inexplicable
persons we sometimes come across in great cities, though seldom or never
in suburban places, where the field may be supposed too restricted for
their operations&mdash;persons who have no perceptible means of subsistence,
and manage to live royally on nothing a year. They hold no government
bonds, they possess no real estate (our neighbors did own their house),
they toil not, neither do they spin; yet they reap all the numerous soft
advantages that usually result from honest toil and skilful spinning.
How do they do it? But this is a digression, and I am quite of the
opinion of the old lady in "David Copperfield," who says, "Let us have
no meandering!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<p>Though my wife had declined to risk a ceremonious call on our neighbors
as a family, I saw no reason why I should not speak to the husband as an
individual, when I happened to encounter him by the wayside. I made
several approaches to do so, when it occurred to my penetration that my
neighbor had the air of trying to avoid me. I resolved to put the
suspicion to the test, and one forenoon, when he was sauntering along on
the opposite side of the road, in the vicinity of Fisher's sawmill, I
deliberately crossed over to address him. The brusque manner in which he
hurried away was not to be misunderstood. Of course I was not going to
force myself upon him.</p>

<p>It was at this time that I began to formulate uncharitable suppositions
touching our neighbors, and would have been as well pleased if some of
my choicest fruit-trees had not overhung their wall. I determined to
keep my eyes open later in the season, when the fruit should be ripe to
pluck. In some folks, a sense of the delicate shades of difference
between <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i> does not seem to be very strongly developed in
the Moon of Cherries, to use the old Indian phrase.</p>

<p>I was sufficiently magnanimous not to impart any of these sinister
impressions to the families with whom we were on visiting terms; for I
despise a gossip. I would say nothing against the persons up the road
until I had something definite to say. My interest in them was&mdash;well,
not exactly extinguished, but burning low. I met the gentleman at
intervals, and passed him without recognition; at rarer intervals I saw
the lady.</p>

<p>After a while I not only missed my occasional glimpses of her pretty,
slim figure, always draped in some soft black stuff with a bit of
scarlet at the throat, but I inferred that she did not go about the
house singing in her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span> light-hearted manner, as formerly. What had
happened? Had the honeymoon suffered eclipse already? Was she ill? I
fancied she was ill, and that I detected a certain anxiety in the
husband, who spent the mornings digging solitarily in the garden, and
seemed to have relinquished those long jaunts to the brow of Blue Hill,
where there is a superb view of all Norfolk County combined with sundry
venerable rattlesnakes with twelve rattles.</p>

<p>As the days went by it became certain that the lady was confined to the
house, perhaps seriously ill, possibly a confirmed invalid. Whether she
was attended by a physician from Canton or from Milton, I was unable to
say; but neither the gig with the large white allopathic horse, nor the
gig with the hom&oelig;opathic sorrel mare, was ever seen hitched at the
gate during the day. If a physician had charge of the case, he visited
his patient only at night. All this moved my sympathy, and I reproached
myself with having had hard thoughts of our neighbors. Trouble had come
to them early. I would have liked to offer them such small, friendly
services as lay in my power; but the memory of the repulse I had
sustained still rankled in me. So I hesitated.</p>

<p>One morning my two boys burst into the library with their eyes
sparkling.</p>

<p>"You know the old elm down the road?" cried one.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The elm with the hang-bird's nest?" shrieked the other.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!"</p>

<p>"Well, we both just climbed up, and there's three young ones in it!"</p>

<p>Then I smiled to think that our new neighbors had got such a promising
little family.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span></p>

<h2>MY FIRST VISIT TO PORTLAND</h2>

<h3>BY MAJOR JACK DOWNING</h3>


<p>In the fall of the year 1829, I took it into my head I'd go to Portland.
I had heard a good deal about Portland, what a fine place it was, and
how the folks got rich there proper fast; and that fall there was a
couple of new papers come up to our place from there, called the
"Portland Courier" and "Family Reader," and they told a good many queer
kind of things about Portland, and one thing and another; and all at
once it popped into my head, and I up and told father, and says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am going to Portland, whether or no; and I'll see what this world is
made of yet."</p>

<p>Father stared a little at first, and said he was afraid I would get
lost; but when he see I was bent upon it, he give it up, and he stepped
to his chist, and opened the till, and took out a dollar, and he gave it
to me; and says he,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jack, this is all I can do for you; but go and lead an honest life, and
I believe I shall hear good of you yet."</p>

<p>He turned and walked across the room, but I could see the tears start
into his eyes. And mother sat down and had a hearty crying-spell.</p>

<p>This made me feel rather bad for a minit or two, and I almost had a mind
to give it up; and then again father's dream came into my mind, and I
mustered up courage, and declared I'd go. So I tackled up the old horse,
and packed in a load of axe-handles, and a few notions; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span> mother
fried me some doughnuts, and put 'em into a box, along with some cheese,
and sausages, and ropped me up another shirt, for I told her I didn't
know how long I should be gone. And after I got rigged out, I went round
and bid all the neighbors good-by, and jumped in, and drove off for
Portland.</p>

<p>Aunt Sally had been married two or three years before, and moved to
Portland; and I inquired round till I found out where she lived, and
went there, and put the old horse up, and eat some supper, and went to
bed.</p>

<p>And the next morning I got up, and straightened right off to see the
editor of the "Portland Courier," for I knew by what I had seen in his
paper, that he was just the man to tell me which way to steer. And when
I come to see him, I knew I was right; for soon as I told him my name,
and what I wanted, he took me by the hand as kind as if he had been a
brother, and says he,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mister," says he, "I'll do anything I can to assist you. You have come
to a good town; Portland is a healthy, thriving place, and any man with
a proper degree of enterprise may do well here. But," says he,
"stranger," and he looked mighty kind of knowing, says he, "if you want
to make out to your mind, you must do as the steamboats do."</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "how do they do?" for I didn't know what a steamboat
was, any more than the man in the moon.</p>

<p>"Why," says he, "they go ahead. And you must drive about among the folks
here just as though you were at home, on the farm among the cattle.
Don't be afraid of any of them, but figure away, and I dare say you'll
get into good business in a very little while. But," says he, "there's
one thing you must be careful of; and that is, not to get into the hands
of those are folks that trades up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span> round Huckler's Row, for ther's some
sharpers up there, if they get hold of you, would twist your eye-teeth
out in five minits."</p>

<p>Well, arter he had giv me all the good advice he could, I went back to
Aunt Sally's ag'in, and got some breakfast; and then I walked all over
the town, to see what chance I could find to sell my axe-handles and
things and to get into business.</p>

<p>After I had walked about three or four hours, I come along towards the
upper end of the town, where I found there were stores and shops of all
sorts and sizes. And I met a feller, and says I,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What place is this?"</p>

<p>"Why, this," says he, "is Huckler's Row."</p>

<p>"What!" says I, "are these the stores where the traders in Huckler's Row
keep?"</p>

<p>And says he, "Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, then," says I to myself, "I have a pesky good mind to go in and
have a try with one of these chaps, and see if they can twist my
eye-teeth out. If they can get the best end of a bargain out of me, they
can do what there ain't a man in our place can do; and I should just
like to know what sort of stuff these 'ere Portland chaps are made of."
So I goes into the best-looking store among 'em. And I see some biscuit
on the shelf, and says I,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mister, how much do you ax apiece for them 'ere biscuits?"</p>

<p>"A cent apiece," says he.</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "I shan't give you that, but, if you've a mind to, I'll
give you two cents for three of them, for I begin to feel a little as
though I would like to take a bite."</p>

<p>"Well," says he, "I wouldn't sell 'em to anybody else so, but, seeing
it's you, I don't care if you take 'em."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span></p>

<p>I knew he lied, for he never seen me before in his life. Well, he handed
down the biscuits, and I took 'em and walked round the store awhile, to
see what else he had to sell. At last says I,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mister, have you got any good cider?"</p>

<p>Says he, "Yes, as good as ever ye see."</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "what do you ax a glass for it?"</p>

<p>"Two cents," says he.</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "seems to me I feel more dry than I do hungry now. Ain't
you a mind to take these 'ere biscuits again, and give me a glass of
cider?"</p>

<p>And says he,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't care if I do."</p>

<p>So he took and laid 'em on the shelf again, and poured out a glass of
cider. I took the cider and drinkt it down, and, to tell the truth, it
was capital good cider. Then says I,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I guess it's time for me to be a-going," and I stept along towards the
door; but says he,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stop, mister: I believe you haven't paid me for the cider?"</p>

<p>"Not paid you for the cider!" says I. "What do you mean by that? Didn't
the biscuits that I give you just come to the cider?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ah, right!" says he.</p>

<p>So I started to go again, and says he,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But stop there, mister: you didn't pay me for the biscuits."</p>

<p>"What!" says I, "do you mean to impose upon me? do you think I am going
to pay you for the biscuits and let you keep them, too? Ain't they there
now on your shelf? What more do you want? I guess, sir, you don't
whittle me in that way."</p>

<p>So I turned about and marched off, and left the feller<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span> staring and
scratching his head, as though he was struck with a dunderment.</p>

<p>Howsomever, I didn't want to cheat him, only jest to show 'em it wa'n't
so easy a matter to pull my eye-teeth out; so I called in next day and
paid him two cents.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE HIRED HAND AND "HA'NTS"</h2>

<h3>BY E.O. LAUGHLIN</h3>


<p>The Hired Hand was Johnnie's oracle. His auguries were infallible; from
his decisions there was no appeal. The wisdom of experienced age was
his, and he always stood willing to impart it to the youngest. No
question was too trivial for him to consider, and none too abstruse for
him to answer. He did not tell Johnnie to "never mind" or wait until he
grew older, but was ever willing to pause in his work to explain things.
And his oracular qualifications were genuine. He had traveled&mdash;had even
been as far as the State Fair; he had read&mdash;from <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> to
<i>Dick the Dead Shot</i>, and, more than all, he had meditated deeply.</p>

<p>The Hired Hand's name was Eph. Perhaps he had another name, too, but if
so it had become obsolete. Far and wide he was known simply as Eph.</p>

<p>Eph was generally termed "a cur'ous feller," and this characterization
applied equally well to his peculiar appearance and his inquiring
disposition. In his confirmation nature had evidently sacrificed her
love of beauty to a temporary passion for elongation. Length seemed to
have been the central thought, the theme, as it were, upon which he had
been composed. This effect was heightened by generously broad hands and
feet and a contrastingly abbreviated chin. The latter feature caused his
countenance to wear in repose a decidedly vacant look, but it was seldom
caught reposing, usually having to bear a smirk of some sort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span></p>

<p>Eph's position in the Winkle household was as peculiar as his
personality. Nominally he was a hired servant, but, in fact, from his
own point of view at least, he was Mr. Winkle's private secretary and
confidential adviser. He had been on the place "ever sence old Fan was a
yearlin'," which was a long while, indeed; and had come to regard
himself as indispensable. The Winkles treated him as one of the family,
and he reciprocated in truly familiar ways. He sat at the table with
them, helped entertain their guests, and often accompanied them to
church. In regulating matters on the farm Mr. Winkle proposed, but Eph
invariably disposed, in a diplomatic way, of course; and, although his
judgment might be based on false logic, the result was generally
successful and satisfactory.</p>

<p>With all his good qualities and her attachment to him, however, Mrs.
Winkle was not sure that Eph's moral status was quite sound, and she was
inclined to discourage Johnnie's association with him. As a matter of
fact she had overheard Johnnie utter several bad words, of which Eph was
certainly the prime source. But a mother's solicitude was of little
avail when compared with Eph's Delphian wisdom. Johnnie would steal away
to join Eph in the field at every chance, and the information he
acquired at these secret s&eacute;ances, was varied and valuable.</p>

<p>It was Eph who taught him how to tell the time of day by the sun; how to
insert a "dutchman" in the place of a lost suspender button; how to make
bird-traps; and how to "skin the cat." Eph initiated him into the
mysteries of magic and witchcraft, and showed him how to locate a
subterranean vein of water by means of a twig of witch-hazel. Eph also
confided to Johnnie that he himself could stanch the flow of blood or
stop a toothache in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>stantly by force of a certain charm, but he could
not tell how to do this because the secret could be imparted only from
man to woman, or vice versa. Even the shadowy domain of spirits had not
been exempt from Eph's investigations, and he related many a terrifying
experience with "ha'nts."</p>

<p>Johnnie was first introduced to the ghost world one summer night, when
he and Eph had gone fishing together.</p>

<p>"If ye want to ketch the big uns, always go at night in the dark o' the
moon," said Eph, and his piscatorial knowledge was absolute.</p>

<p>They had fished in silence for some time, and Johnnie was nodding, when
Eph suddenly whispered:</p>

<p>"Let's go home, sonny, I think I see a ha'nt down yander."</p>

<p>Johnnie had no idea what a "ha'nt" might be, but Eph's constrained
manner betokened something dreadful.</p>

<p>It was not until they had come within sight of home that Johnnie
ventured to inquire:</p>

<p>"Say, Eph, what is a ha'nt?"</p>

<p>"Huh! What is ha'nts? Why, sonny, you mean to tell me you don't know
what ha'nts is?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly; sompin' like wildcats, ain't they?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be confounded! Wildcats! Not by a long shot;" and Eph broke
into the soft chuckle which always preceded his explanations. They
reached the orchard fence, and, seating himself squarely on the topmost
rail, Eph began impressively:</p>

<p>"Ha'nts is the remains of dead folks&mdash;more 'specially them that's been
assinated, er, that is, kilt&mdash;understan'? They're kind o' like sperrits,
ye know. After so long a time they take to comin' back to yarth an'
ha'ntin' the precise spot where they wuz murdered. They always come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
after dark, an' the diffrunt shapes they take on is supprisin'. I have
seed ha'nts that looked like sheep, an' ha'nts that looked like human
persons; but lots of 'em ye cain't see a-tall, bein' invisible, as the
sayin' is. Now, fer all we know, they may be a ha'nt settin' right here
betwixt us, this minute!"</p>

<p>With this solemn declaration Johnnie shivered and began edging closer to
Eph, until restrained and appalled by the thought that he might actually
sit on the unseen spirit by such movement.</p>

<p>"But do they hurt people, Eph?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>Eph gave vent to another chuckle.</p>

<p>"Not if ye understan' the'r ways," he observed sagely. "If ye let 'em
alone an' don't go foolin' aroun' the'r ha'ntin'-groun' they'll never
harm ye. But don't ye never trifle with no ha'nt, sonny. I knowed a
feller't thought 'twuz smart to hector 'em an' said he wuzn't feared.
Onct he throwed a rock at one&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Eph paused.</p>

<p>"What h-happened?" gasped Johnnie.</p>

<p>"In one year from that time," replied Eph gruesomely, "that there
feller's cow wuz hit by lightnin'; in three year his hoss kicked him an'
busted a rib; an' in seven year he wuz a corpse!"</p>

<p>The power of this horrible example was too much for Johnnie.</p>

<p>"Don't you reckon it's bedtime?" he suggested tremblingly.</p>

<p>Thenceforth for many months Johnnie led a haunted life. Ghosts glowered
at him from cellar and garret. Specters slunk at his heels, phantoms
flitted through the barn. Twilight teemed with horrors, and midnight,
when he awoke at that hour, made of his bedroom a veritable Brocken.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span></p>

<p>It was vain for his parents to expostulate with him. Was one not bound
to believe one's own eyes? And how about the testimony of the Hired
Hand?</p>

<p>The story in his reader&mdash;told in verse and graphically illustrated&mdash;of
the boy named Walter, who, being alone on a lonesome highway one dark
night, beheld a sight that made his blood run cold, acquired an abnormal
interest for Johnnie. Walter, with courage resembling madness, marched
straight up to the alleged ghost and laughed gleefully to find, "It was
a friendly guide-post, his wand'ring steps to guide."</p>

<p>This was all very well, as it turned out, but what if it had been a
sure-enough ghost, reflected Johnnie. What if it had reached down with
its long, snaky arms and snatched Walter up&mdash;and run off with him in the
dark&mdash;and no telling what? Or it might have swooped straight up in the
air with him, for ghosts could do that. Johnnie resolved he would not
take any chances with friendly guide-posts which might turn out to be
hostile spirits.</p>

<p>Then there was the similar tale of the lame goose, and the one
concerning the pillow in the swing&mdash;each intended, no doubt, to allay
foolish fears on the part of children, but exercising an opposite and
harrowing influence upon Johnnie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span></p>

<h2>GARDEN ETHICS</h2>

<h3>BY CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER</h3>


<p>I believe that I have found, if not original sin, at least vegetable
total depravity in my garden; and it was there before I went into it. It
is the bunch-, or joint-, or snake-grass,&mdash;whatever it is called. As I
do not know the names of all the weeds and plants, I have to do as Adam
did in his garden,&mdash;name things as I find them. This grass has a
slender, beautiful stalk: and when you cut it down, or pull up a long
root of it, you fancy it is got rid of; but in a day or two it will come
up in the same spot in half a dozen vigorous blades. Cutting down and
pulling up is what it thrives on. Extermination rather helps it. If you
follow a slender white root, it will be found to run under the ground
until it meets another slender white root; and you will soon unearth a
network of them, with a knot somewhere, sending out dozens of
sharp-pointed, healthy shoots, every joint prepared to be an independent
life and plant. The only way to deal with it is to take one part hoe and
two parts fingers, and carefully dig it out, not leaving a joint
anywhere. It will take a little time, say all summer, to dig out
thoroughly a small patch; but if you once dig it out, and keep it out,
you will have no further trouble.</p>

<p>I have said it was total depravity. Here it is. If you attempt to pull
up and root out sin in you, which shows on the surface,&mdash;if it does not
show, you do not care for it,&mdash;you may have noticed how it runs into an
interior network of sins, and an ever-sprouting branch of these roots
somewhere; and that you can not pull out one without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span> making a general
internal disturbance, and rooting up your whole being. I suppose it is
less trouble to quietly cut them off at the top&mdash;say once a week, on
Sunday, when you put on your religious clothes and face,&mdash;so that no one
will see them, and not try to eradicate the network within.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;This moral vegetable figure is at the service of any
clergyman who will have the manliness to come forward and help me at a
day's hoeing on my potatoes. None but the orthodox need apply.</p>

<p>I, however, believe in the intellectual, if not the moral, qualities of
vegetables, and especially weeds. There was a worthless vine that (or
who) started up about midway between a grape-trellis and a row of
bean-poles, some three feet from each, but a little nearer the trellis.
When it came out of the ground, it looked around to see what it should
do. The trellis was already occupied. The bean-pole was empty. There was
evidently a little the best chance of light, air, and sole
proprietorship on the pole. And the vine started for the pole, and began
to climb it with determination. Here was as distinct an act of choice,
of reason, as a boy exercises when he goes into a forest, and, looking
about, decides which tree he will climb. And, besides, how did the vine
know enough to travel in exactly the right direction, three feet, to
find what it wanted? This is intellect. The weeds, on the other hand,
have hateful moral qualities. To cut down a weed is, therefore, to do a
moral action. I feel as if I were destroying a sin. My hoe becomes an
instrument of retributive justice. I am an apostle of nature. This view
of the matter lends a dignity to the art of hoeing which nothing else
does, and lifts it into the region of ethics. Hoeing becomes, not a
pastime, but a duty. And you get to regard it so, as the days and the
weeds lengthen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Observation.</i>&mdash;Nevertheless, what a man needs in gardening is a
cast-iron back, with a hinge in it. The hoe is an ingenious instrument,
calculated to call out a great deal of strength at a great disadvantage.</p>

<p>The striped bug has come, the saddest of the year. He is a moral
double-ender, iron-clad at that. He is unpleasant in two ways. He
burrows in the ground so that you can not find him, and he flies away so
that you can not catch him. He is rather handsome, as bugs go, but
utterly dastardly, in that he gnaws the stem of the plant close to the
ground, and ruins it without any apparent advantage to himself. I find
him on the hills of cucumbers (perhaps it will be a cholera-year, and we
shall not want any), the squashes (small loss), and the melons (which
never ripen). The best way to deal with the striped bug is to sit down
by the hills, and patiently watch for him. If you are spry, you can
annoy him. This, however, takes time. It takes all day and part of the
night. For he flieth in the darkness, and wasteth at noonday. If you get
up before the dew is off the plants,&mdash;it goes off very early,&mdash;you can
sprinkle soot on the plant (soot is my panacea: if I can get the disease
of a plant reduced to the necessity of soot, I am all right); and soot
is unpleasant to the bug. But the best thing to do is set a toad to
catch the bugs. The toad at once establishes the most intimate relations
with the bug. It is a pleasure to see such unity among the lower
animals. The difficulty is to make the toad stay and watch the hill. If
you know your toad, it is all right. If you do not, you must build a
tight fence round the plants, which the toad can not jump over. This,
however, introduces a new element. I find that I have a zo&ouml;logical
garden. It is an unexpected result of my little enterprise, which never
aspired to the completeness of the Paris "Jardin des Plantes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span></p>

<h2>A TRAVELED DONKEY</h2>

<h3>BY BERT LESTON TAYLOR</h3>


<p>But Buddie got no farther. The sound of music came to her ears, and she
stopped to listen. The music was faint and sweet, with the sighful
quality of an &AElig;olian harp. Now it seemed near, now far.</p>

<p>"What can it be?" said Buddie.</p>

<p>"Wait here and I'll find out," said Snowfeathers. He darted away and
returned before you could count fifty.</p>

<p>"A traveling musician," he reported. "Come along. It's only a little
way."</p>

<p>Back he flew, with Buddie scrambling after. A few yards brought her to a
little open place, and here was the queerest sight she had yet seen in
this queer wood.</p>

<p>On a bank of reindeer moss, at the foot of a great white birch, a
mouse-colored donkey sat playing a lute. Over his head, hanging from a
bit of bark, was the sign:</p>

<div class="bboxsm">
<div class="boxtext">
<p style="text-align: center;">
<b>WHILE YOU WAIT<br />
OLD SAWS RESET</b><br />
</p></div></div>

<p>After the many strange things that Buddie had come upon in Queerwood,
nothing could surprise her very much. Besides, as she never before had
seen a donkey, or a lute, or the combination of donkey and lute, it did
not strike her as especially remarkable that the musician should be
holding his instrument upside down, and sweeping the strings with one of
his long ears, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span> he was able to wave without moving his head a jot.
And this it was that gave to the music its soft and furry-purry quality.</p>

<p>The Donkey greeted Buddie with a careless nod, and remarked, as if
anticipating a comment he had heard many times:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I play everything <i>by ear</i>."</p>

<p>"Please keep on playing," said Buddie, taking a seat on another clump of
reindeer moss.</p>

<p>"I intended to," said the Donkey; and the random chords changed to a
crooning melody which wonderfully pleased Buddie, whose opportunities to
hear music were sadly few. As for the White Blackbird, he tucked his
little head under his wing and went fast asleep.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of it?" asked the Donkey, putting down the
lute.</p>

<p>"Very nice, sir," answered Buddie, enthusiastically; though she added to
herself: The idea of saying sir to an animal! "Would you please tell me
your name?" she requested.</p>

<p>The Donkey pawed open a saddle-bag, drew forth with his teeth a card,
and presented it to Buddie, who spelled out the following:</p>

<div class="bboxsm">
<div class="boxtext">
<p style="text-align: center;">
<b>PROFESSOR BRAY<br />
TENORE BARITONALE<br />
TEACHER OF SINGING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALL METHODS<br />
CONCERTS AND RECITALS</b><br />
</p></div></div>

<p>While Buddie was reading this the Donkey again picked up his instrument
and thrummed the strings.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see a donkey play a lute?" said he. "That's an old saw,"
he added.</p>

<p>"I never saw a donkey before," said Buddie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span></p>

<p>"You haven't traveled much," said the other. "The world is full of
them."</p>

<p>"This is the farthest I've ever been from home," confessed Buddie,
feeling very insignificant indeed.</p>

<p>"And how far may that be?"</p>

<p>Buddie couldn't tell exactly.</p>

<p>"But it can't be a great way," she said. "I live in the log house by the
lake."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said the Donkey. "That's no distance at all." Buddie shrank
another inch or two. "I'm a great traveler myself. All donkeys travel
that can. If a donkey travels, you know, he <i>may</i> come home a horse; and
to become a horse is, of course, the ambition of every donkey!"</p>

<p>"Is it?" was all Buddie could think of to remark. What could she say
that would interest a globe-trotter?</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have an old saw you'd like reset," suggested the Donkey,
still thrumming the lute-strings.</p>

<p>Buddie thought a moment.</p>

<p>"There's an old saw hanging up in our woodshed," she began, but got no
farther.</p>

<p>"Hee-haw! hee-haw!" laughed the Donkey. "Thistles and cactus, but that's
rich!" And he hee-hawed until the tears ran down his nose. Poor Buddie,
who knew she was being laughed at but didn't know why, began to feel
very much like crying and wished she might run away.</p>

<p>"Excuse these tears," the Donkey said at last, recovering his family
gravity. "Didn't you ever hear the saying, A burnt child dreads the
fire?"</p>

<p>Buddie nodded, and plucked up her spirits.</p>

<p>"Well, that's an old saw. And you must have heard that other very old
saw, No use crying over spilt milk."</p>

<p>Another nod from Buddie.</p>

<p>"Here's my setting of that," said the Donkey; and after a few
introductory chords, he sang:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Oh, why do you cry, my pretty little maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With a Boo-hoo-hoo and a Heigho?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I've spilled my milk, kind sir,' she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the Cat said, 'Me-oh! my-oh!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'No use to cry, my pretty little maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With a Boo-hoo-hoo and a Heigho.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'But what shall I do, kind sir?' she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the Cat said, 'Me-oh! my-oh!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Why, dry your eyes, my pretty little maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With a Boo-hoo-hoo and a Heigho.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Oh, thank you, thank you, sir,' she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the Cat said, 'Me-oh! my-oh!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"How do you like my voice?" asked the Donkey, in a tone that said very
plainly: "If you don't like it you're no judge of singing."</p>

<p>Buddie did not at once reply. A professional critic would have said, and
enjoyed saying, that the voice was of the hit-or-miss variety; that it
was pitched too high (all donkeys make that mistake); that it was harsh,
rasping and unsympathetic, and that altogether the performance was "not
convincing."</p>

<p>Now, Little One, although Buddie was not a professional critic, and
neither knew how to wound nor enjoyed wounding, even <i>she</i> found the
Donkey's voice harsh; but she did not wish to hurt his feelings&mdash;for
donkeys <i>have</i> feelings, in spite of a popular opinion to the contrary.
And, after all, it was pretty good singing for a donkey. Critics should
not, as they sometimes do, apply to donkeys the standards by which
nightingales are judged. So Buddie was able to say, truthfully and
kindly:</p>

<p>"I think you do very well; very well, indeed."</p>

<p>It was a small tribute, but the Donkey was so blinded by conceit that he
accepted it as the greatest compliment.</p>

<p>"I <i>ought</i> to sing well," he said. "I've studied methods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span> enough. The
more methods you try, you know, the more of a donkey you are."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," murmured Buddie, not understanding in the least.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on the Donkey; "I've taken the Donkesi Method, the Sobraylia
Method, the Thistlefixu Method&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't quite know what you mean by 'methods,'" ventured
Buddie.</p>

<p>The Donkey regarded her with a pitying smile.</p>

<p>"A method," he explained, "is a way of singing 'Ah!' For example, in the
Thistlefixu Method, which I am at present using, I fill my mouth full of
thistles, stand on one leg, take in a breath three yards long, and sing
'Ah!' The only trouble with this method is that the thistles tickle your
throat and make you cough, and you have to spray the vocal cords twice a
day, which is considerable trouble, especially when traveling, as <i>I</i>
always am."</p>

<p>"I should think it <i>would</i> be," said Buddie. "Won't you sing something
else?"</p>

<p>"I'm a little hoarse," apologized the singer.</p>

<p>"That's what you want to be, isn't it?" said Buddie, misunderstanding
him.</p>

<p>"Hee-haw!" laughed the Donkey. "Is that a joke? I mean my <i>throat</i> is
hoarse."</p>

<p>"And the rest of you is donkey!" cried Buddie, who could see a point as
quickly as any one of her age.</p>

<p>"There's something to that," said the other, thoughtfully. "Now, if the
<i>hoarseness</i> should spread&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you became <i>horse</i> all over&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Think of another old saw," said the Donkey, picking up his lute.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; I don't believe I can remember any more old saws," said Buddie,
after racking her small brain for a minute or two.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said the Donkey. "They're as common as, Pass the butter, or,
Some more tea, please. Ever hear, Fair words butter no parsnips?"</p>

<p>Buddie shook her head.</p>

<p>"The wolf does something every day that keeps him from church on
Sunday&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Again Buddy shook her head.</p>

<p>"It is hard to shave an egg&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Still another shake.</p>

<p>"A miss is as good as a mile? You can not drive a windmill with a pair
of bellows? Help the lame dog over the stile? A hand-saw is a good
thing, but not to shave with? Nothing venture, nothing have? Well, you
haven't heard much, for a fact," said the Donkey, contemptuously, as
Buddie shook her head after each proverb. "I'll try a few more; there's
no end to them. Ever hear, When the sky falls we shall all catch larks?
Too many cooks spoil the broth?"</p>

<p>"I've heard <i>that</i>," said Buddie, eagerly.</p>

<p>"It's a wonder," returned the Donkey. "Well, I have a very nice setting
of that." And he sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Some said, 'Stir it fast,'<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Some said, 'Slow';<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some said, 'Skim it off,'<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Some said, 'No';<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some said, 'Pepper,'<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Some said, 'Salt';&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All gave good advice,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">All found fault.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Poor little Tommy Trottett!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Couldn't eat it when he got it."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I like that," said Buddie. "Oh, and I've just thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span> of another old
ax&mdash;I mean saw, if it <i>is</i> one&mdash;Don't count your chickens before they
are hatched. Do you sing that?"</p>

<p>"One of my best," replied the Donkey. And again he sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Thirteen eggs,' said Sammy Patch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Are thirteen chickens when they hatch.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hen gave a cluck, but said no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the hen had heard such things before.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The eggs fall out from tilted pail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave behind a yellow trail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sammy,&mdash;counting, as he goes,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, Sammy Patch, your 'rithmetic<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Won't hatch a solitary chick."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I like that the best," said Buddie, who knew what it was to tip over a
pail of eggs, and felt as sorry for Sammy Patch as if he really existed.</p>

<p>"It's one of my best," said the Donkey. "I don't call it my very best.
Personally I prefer, Look before you leap. You've heard that old saw, I
dare say."</p>

<p>"No; but that doesn't matter. I shall like it just as well," replied
Buddie.</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> doesn't follow, but <i>this</i> does," said the Donkey, and once more
he sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A foolish Frog, one summer day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While splashing round in careless way,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'I think I know,' remarked the Frog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'A safer place than on this log;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">For when a man<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Comes with a can<br /></span>
<span class="i8">His object is malicious.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus far the foolish Frog was wise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But had he better used his eyes,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
<span class="i6">He would have seen,<br /></span>

<span class="i8">To see where you are going."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Buddie, however, clung to her former opinion. "I like <i>Sammy Patch</i> the
best," said she.</p>

<p>"That," rejoined the singer, "is a matter of taste, as the donkey said
to the horse who preferred hay to thistles. Usually the public likes
best the very piece the composer himself cares least about. So wherever
I go I hear, 'Oh, Professor, do sing us that beautiful song about Sammy
Patch.' And I can't poke my head inside the Thistle Club but some donkey
bawls out, 'Here's Bray! Now we'll have a song. Sing us <i>Sammy Patch</i>,
old fellow.' Really, I've sung that song so many times I'm tired of the
sound of it."</p>

<p>"It must be nice to be such a favorite," said Buddie.</p>

<p>"Suppose we go up to the Corner and see what's stirring," suggested the
Donkey, with a yawn.</p>

<p>"Oh, are <i>you</i> going up to the Corner, too?" cried Buddie. "I am to meet
the Rabbit there at two o'clock. I hope it isn't late."</p>

<p>The Donkey glanced skyward.</p>

<p>"It isn't noon yet," said he.</p>

<p>"How do you tell time?" inquired Buddie.</p>

<p>"By the way it flies. Time flies, you know. You can tell a great many
birds that way, too." As he spoke the Donkey put his lute into one of
his bags and took down his sign.</p>

<p>"You can ride if you wish," he offered graciously.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Buddie. And leaving the White<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span> Blackbird asleep on his
perch,&mdash;for, as Buddie said, he was having such a lovely nap it would be
a pity to wake him,&mdash;they set off through the wood.</p>

<p>It was bad traveling for a short distance, but presently they came out
on an old log-road; and along this the Donkey ambled at an easy pace. On
both sides grew wild flowers in wonderful abundance, but, as Buddie
noticed, they were all of one kind&mdash;Enchanter's Nightshade.</p>

<p>Buddie had also noticed, when she climbed to her comfortable seat, a
peculiar marking on the Donkey's broad back. It was bronze in color, and
in shape like a cross.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's a strawberry mark," she thought, "and he may not want to
talk about it." But curiosity got the better of her.</p>

<p>"Oh, that?" said the Donkey, carelessly, in reply to a question. "That's
a Victoria Cross. I served three months with the British army in South
Africa, and was decorated for gallantry in leading a charge of the
ambulance corps. I shall have to ask you not to hang things on my neck.
It's all I can do to hold up my head."</p>

<p>"Oh, excuse me," said Buddie, untying the sign, <span class="smcap">Old Saws Reset While You
Wait</span>.</p>

<p>"Hang it round your own neck," said the Donkey, and Buddie did so.</p>

<p>"I often wonder," she said, "whether a horse doesn't sometimes get tired
holding his head out at the end of his neck. And as for a giraffe, I
don't see how he stands it."</p>

<p>"Well, a giraffe's neck runs out at a more convenient angle," said the
Donkey. "Still, it <i>is</i> tiresome without a check-rein. You hear a great
deal about a check-rein being a cruel invention, but, on the contrary,
it's a great blessing. Now, a nose-bag is a positive outrage, and the
more oats it contains the more of an imposition it is. People have the
queerest ideas!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span></p>

<h2>SELECTING THE FACULTY</h2>

<h3>BY BAYNARD RUST HALL</h3>


<p>Our Board of Trustees, it will be remembered, had been directed by the
Legislature to procure, as the ordinance called it, "Teachers for the
commencement of the State College at Woodville." That business, by the
Board, was committed to Dr. Sylvan and Robert Carlton&mdash;the most learned
gentleman of the body, and of&mdash;the New Purchase. Our honorable Board
will be more specially introduced hereafter; at present we shall bring
forward certain rejected candidates, that, like rejected prize essays,
they may be published, and <i>thus</i> have their revenge.</p>

<p>None can tell us how plenty good things are till he looks for them; and
hence, to the great surprise of the Committee, there seemed to be a
sudden growth and a large crop of persons even in and around Woodville,
either already qualified for the "Professorships," as we named them in
our publication, or who <i>could</i> "qualify" by the time of election. As to
the "chair" named also in our publications, one very worthy and
disinterested schoolmaster offered, as a great collateral inducement for
his being elected, "<i>to find his own chair!</i>"&mdash;a vast saving to the
State, if the same chair I saw in Mr. Whackum's school-room. For his
chair there was one with a hickory bottom; and doubtless he would have
filled it, and even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span> lapped over its edges, with equal dignity in the
recitation room of Big College.</p>

<p>The Committee had, at an early day, given an invitation to the Rev.
Charles Clarence, A.M., of New Jersey, and his answer had been
affirmative; yet for political reasons we had been obliged to invite
competitors, or <i>make</i> them, and we found and created "a right smart
sprinkle."</p>

<p>Hopes of success were built on many things&mdash;for instance, on poverty; a
plea being entered that something ought to be done for the poor
fellow&mdash;on one's having taught a common school all his born days, who
now deserved to rise a peg&mdash;on political, or religious, or fanatical
partizan qualifications&mdash;and on pure patriotic principles, such as a
person's having been "born in a canebrake and rocked in a sugar trough."
On the other hand, a fat, dull-headed, and modest Englishman asked for a
place, because he had been born in Liverpool! and had seen the world
beyond the woods and waters, too! And another fussy, talkative,
pragmatical little gentleman rested his pretensions on his ability to
draw and paint maps!&mdash;not projecting them in roundabout scientific
processes, but in that speedy and elegant style in which young ladies
<i>copy</i> maps at first chop boarding-schools! Nay, so transcendent seemed
Mr. Merchator's claims, when his <i>show</i> or <i>sample</i> maps were exhibited
to us, that some in our Board, and nearly everybody out of it, were
confident he would do for Professor of Mathematics and even Principal.</p>

<p>But of all our unsuccessful candidates, we shall introduce by name only
two&mdash;Mr. James Jimmy, A.S.S., and Mr. Solomon Rapid, A. to Z.</p>

<p>Mr. Jimmy, who aspired to the mathematical chair, was master of a small
school of all sexes, near Woodville. At the first, he was kindly, yet
honestly told, his knowledge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span> was too limited and inaccurate; yet,
notwithstanding this, and some almost rude repulses afterward, he
persisted in his application and his hopes. To give evidence of
competency, he once told me he was arranging a new spelling-book, the
publication of which would make him known as a literary man, and be an
unspeakable advantage to "the rising generation." And this naturally
brought on the following colloquy about the work:</p>

<p>"Ah! indeed! Mr. Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, Mr. Carlton."</p>

<p>"On what new principle do you go, sir?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, on the principles of nature and common sense. I allow
school-books for schools are all too powerful obstruse and hard-like to
be understood without exemplifying illustrations."</p>

<p>"Yes, but Mr. Jimmy, how is a child's spelling-book to be made any
plainer?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, by clear explifications of the words in one column, by
exemplifying illustrations in the other."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, Mr. Jimmy, give me a specimen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"An example&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To be sure&mdash;here's a spes-a-example; you see, for instance, I put in
the spelling-column, C-r-e-a-m, <i>cream</i>, and here in the explification
column, I put the exemplifying illustration&mdash;<i>Unctious part of milk!</i>"</p>

<p>We had asked, at our first interview, if our candidate was an
algebraist, and his reply was <i>negative</i>; but, "he allowed he could
'<i>qualify</i>' by the time of election, as he was powerful good at figures,
and had cyphered clean through every arithmetic he had ever seen, the
rule of promiscuous questions and all!" Hence, some weeks after, as I
was passing his door, on my way to a squirrel hunt,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span> with a party of
friends, Mr. Jimmy, hurrying out with a slate in his hand, begged me to
stop a moment, and thus addressed me:</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Carlton, this algebra is a most powerful thing&mdash;ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Indeed it is, Mr. Jimmy&mdash;have you been looking into it?"</p>

<p>"Looking into it! I have been all through this here fust part; and by
election time, I allow I'll be ready for examination."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir! but it is such a pretty thing! Only to think of cyphering by
letters! Why, sir, the sums come out, and bring the answers exactly like
figures. Jist stop a minute&mdash;look here: <i>a</i> stands for 6, and <i>b</i> stands
for 8, and <i>c</i> stands for 4, and <i>d</i> stands for figure 10; now if I say
a plus b minus c equals d, it is all the same as if I said, 6 is 6 and 8
makes 14, and 4 subtracted, leaves 10! Why, sir, I done a whole slate
full of letters and signs; and afterward, when I tried by figures, they
every one of them came out right and brung the answer! I mean to cypher
by letters altogether."</p>

<p>"Mr. Jimmy, my company is nearly out of sight&mdash;if you can get along this
way through simple and quadratic equations by our meeting, your chance
will not be so bad&mdash;good morning, sir."</p>

<p>But our man of "letters" quit cyphering the new way, and returned to
plain figures long before reaching equations; and so he could not become
our professor. Yet anxious to do us all the good in his power, after our
college opened, he waited on me, a leading trustee, with a proposal to
board our students, and authorized me to publish&mdash;"as how Mr. James
Jimmy will take strange students&mdash;students not belonging to
Woodville&mdash;to board, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span> one dollar a week, and find everything, washing
included, and will black their <i>shoes</i> three times a week to <i>boot</i>,
and&mdash;<i>give them their dog-wood and cherry-bitters every morning into the
bargain!</i>"</p>

<p>The most extraordinary candidate, however, was Mr. Solomon Rapid. He was
now somewhat advanced into the shaving age, and was ready to assume
offices the most opposite in character; although justice compels us to
say Mr. Rapid was as fit for one thing as another. Deeming it waste of
time to prepare for any station till he was certain of obtaining it, he
wisely demanded the place first, and then set to work to become
qualified for its duties, being, I suspect, the very man, or some
relation of his, who is recorded as not knowing whether he could read
Greek, as he had never tried. And, besides, Mr. Solomon Rapid contended
that all offices, from president down to fence-viewer, were open to
every white American citizen; and that every republican had a
blood-bought right to seek any that struck his fancy; and if the profits
were less, or the duties more onerous than had been anticipated, that a
man ought to resign and try another.</p>

<p>Naturally, therefore, Mr. Rapid thought he would like to sit in our
chair of languages, or have some employment in the State college; and
hence he called for that purpose on Dr. Sylvan, who, knowing the
candidate's character, maliciously sent him to me. Accordingly, the
young gentleman presented himself, and without ceremony, instantly made
known his business thus:</p>

<p>"I heerd, sir, you wanted somebody to teach the State school, and I'm
come to let you know I'm willing to take the place."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, we are going to elect a professor of languages who is to be
the principal and a professor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't care which I take, but I'm willing to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span> the principal.
I can teach sifring, reading, writing, joggerfee, surveying, grammur,
spelling, definition, parsin&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you a linguist?"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"You, of course, understand the dead languages?"</p>

<p>"Well, can't say I ever seed much of them, though I have heerd tell of
them; but I can soon larn them&mdash;they ain't more than a few of them I
allow?"</p>

<p>"Oh! my dear sir, it is not possible&mdash;we&mdash;can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I never seed what I couldn't larn about as smart as anybody&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Rapid, I do not mean to question your abilities; but if you are now
wholly unacquainted with the dead languages, it is impossible for you or
any other talented man to learn them under four or five years."</p>

<p>"Pshoo! foo! I'll bet I larn one in three weeks! Try me, sir,&mdash;let's
have the furst one furst&mdash;how many are there?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Rapid, it is utterly impossible; but if you insist, I will loan you
a Latin book&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's your sort, let's have it, that's all I want, fair play."</p>

<p>Accordingly, I handed him a copy of Histori&aelig; Sacr&aelig;, with which he soon
went away, saying, he "didn't allow it would take long to git through
Latin, if 'twas only sich a thin patch of a book as that."</p>

<p>In a few weeks, to my no small surprise, Mr. Solomon Rapid again
presented himself; and drawing forth the book began with a triumphant
expression of countenance:</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I have done the Latin."</p>

<p>"Done the Latin!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can read it as fast as English."</p>

<p>"Read it as fast as English!!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, as fast as English&mdash;and I didn't find it hard at all."</p>

<p>"May I try you on a page?"</p>

<p>"Try away, try away; that's what I've come for."</p>

<p>"Please read here then, Mr. Rapid;" and in order to give him a fair
chance, I pointed to the first lines of the first chapter, viz.: "In
principio Deus creavit c&oelig;lum et terram intra sex dies; primo die
fecit lucem," etc.</p>

<p>"That, sir?" and then he read thus, "In prinspo duse creevit kalelum et
terrum intra sex dyes&mdash;primmo dye fe-fe-sit looseum," etc.</p>

<p>"That will do, Mr. Rapid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! ha! I told you so."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;but translate."</p>

<p>"Translate!" (eyebrows elevating.)</p>

<p>"Yes, translate, render it."</p>

<p>"Render it!! how's that?" (forehead more wrinkled.)</p>

<p>"Why, yes, render it into English&mdash;give me the meaning of it."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Meaning</span>!!" (staring full in my face, his eyes like saucers, and
forehead wrinkled with the furrows of eighty)&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Meaning</span>!! I didn't know
it <i>had</i> any meaning. I thought it was a <span class="smcap">Dead</span> language!!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Well, reader, I am glad you are <i>not</i> laughing at Mr. Rapid; for how
should anything <i>dead</i> speak out so as to be understood? And indeed,
does not his definition suit the vexed feelings of some young gentlemen
attempting to read Latin without any interlinear translation? and who
inwardly, cursing both book and teacher, blast their souls "if they can
make any sense out of it." The ancients may yet speak in their own
languages to a few; but to most who boast the honor of their
acquaintance, they are certainly dead in the sense of Solomon Rapid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span></p>

<h2>ROLLO LEARNING TO READ</h2>

<h3>BY ROBERT J. BURDETTE</h3>


<p>When Rollo was five years young, his father said to him one evening:</p>

<p>"Rollo, put away your roller skates and bicycle, carry that rowing
machine out into the hall, and come to me. It is time for you to learn
to read."</p>

<p>Then Rollo's father opened the book which he had sent home on a truck
and talked to the little boy about it. It was Bancroft's History of the
United States, half complete in twenty-three volumes. Rollo's father
explained to Rollo and Mary his system of education, with special
reference to Rollo's learning to read. His plan was that Mary should
teach Rollo fifteen hours a day for ten years, and by that time Rollo
would be half through the beginning of the first volume, and would like
it very much indeed.</p>

<p>Rollo was delighted at the prospect. He cried aloud:</p>

<p>"Oh, papa! thank you very much. When I read this book clear through, all
the way to the end of the last volume, may I have another little book to
read?"</p>

<p>"No," replied his father, "that may not be; because you will never get
to the last volume of this one. For as fast as you read one volume, the
author of this history, or his heirs, executors, administrators, or
assigns, will write another as an appendix. So even though you should
live to be a very old man, like the boy preacher, this history will
always be twenty-three volumes ahead of you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span> Now, Mary and Rollo, this
will be a hard task (pronounced tawsk) for both of you, and Mary must
remember that Rollo is a very little boy, and must be very patient and
gentle."</p>

<p>The next morning after the one preceding it, Mary began the first
lesson. In the beginning she was so gentle and patient that her mother
went away and cried, because she feared her dear little daughter was
becoming too good for this sinful world, and might soon spread her wings
and fly away and be an angel.</p>

<p>But in the space of a short time, the novelty of the expedition wore
off, and Mary resumed running her temper&mdash;which was of the
old-fashioned, low-pressure kind, just forward of the fire-box&mdash;on its
old schedule. When she pointed to "A" for the seventh time, and Rollo
said "W," she tore the page out by the roots, hit her little brother
such a whack over the head with the big book that it set his birthday
back six weeks, slapped him twice, and was just going to bite him, when
her mother came in. Mary told her that Rollo had fallen down stairs and
torn his book and raised that dreadful lump on his head. This time
Mary's mother restrained her emotion, and Mary cried. But it was not
because she feared her mother was pining away. Oh, no; it was her
mother's rugged health and virile strength that grieved Mary, as long as
the seance lasted, which was during the entire performance.</p>

<p>That evening Rollo's father taught Rollo his lesson and made Mary sit by
and observe his methods, because, he said, that would be normal
instruction for her. He said:</p>

<p>"Mary, you must learn to control your temper and curb your impatience if
you want to wear low-neck dresses, and teach school. You must be sweet
and patient, or you will never succeed as a teacher. Now, Rollo, what is
this letter?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span></p>

<p>"I dunno," said Rollo, resolutely.</p>

<p>"That is A," said his father, sweetly.</p>

<p>"Huh," replied Rollo, "I knowed that."</p>

<p>"Then why did you not say so?" replied his father, so sweetly that
Jonas, the hired boy, sitting in the corner, licked his chops.</p>

<p>Rollo's father went on with the lesson:</p>

<p>"What is this, Rollo?"</p>

<p>"I dunno," said Rollo, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Sure?" asked his father. "You do not know what it is?"</p>

<p>"Nuck," said Rollo.</p>

<p>"It is A," said his father.</p>

<p>"A what?" asked Rollo.</p>

<p>"A nothing," replied his father, "it is just A. Now, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Just A," said Rollo.</p>

<p>"Do not be flip, my son," said Mr. Holliday, "but attend to your lesson.
What letter is this?"</p>

<p>"I dunno," said Rollo.</p>

<p>"Don't fib to me," said his father, gently, "you said a minute ago that
you knew. That is N."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Rollo, meekly. Rollo, although he was a little boy,
was no slouch, if he did wear bibs; he knew where he lived without
looking at the door-plate. When it came time to be meek, there was no
boy this side of the planet Mars who could be meeker, on shorter notice.
So he said, "Yes, sir," with that subdued and well pleased alacrity of a
boy who has just been asked to guess the answer to the conundrum, "Will
you have another piece of pie?"</p>

<p>"Well," said his father, rather suddenly, "what is it?"</p>

<p>"M," said Rollo, confidently.</p>

<p>"N!" yelled his father, in three-line Gothic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span></p>

<p>"N," echoed Rollo, in lower case nonpareil.</p>

<p>"B-a-n," said his father, "what does that spell?"</p>

<p>"Cat?" suggested Rollo, a trifle uncertainly.</p>

<p>"Cat?" snapped his father, with a sarcastic inflection, "b-a-n, cat!
Where were you raised? Ban! B-a-n&mdash;Ban! Say it! Say it, or I'll get at
you with a skate-strap!"</p>

<p>"B-a-m, band," said Rollo, who was beginning to wish that he had a
rain-check and could come back and see the remaining innings some other
day.</p>

<p>"Ba-a-a-an!" shouted his father, "B-a-n, Ban, Ban, Ban! Now say Ban!"</p>

<p>"Ban," said Rollo, with a little gasp.</p>

<p>"That's right," his father said, in an encouraging tone; "you will learn
to read one of these years if you give your mind to it. All he needs,
you see, Mary, is a teacher who doesn't lose patience with him the first
time he makes a mistake. Now, Rollo, how do you spell, B-a-n&mdash;Ban?"</p>

<p>Rollo started out timidly on c-a&mdash;then changed to d-o,&mdash;and finally
compromised on h-e-n.</p>

<p>Mr. Holiday made a pass at him with Volume I, but Rollo saw it coming
and got out of the way.</p>

<p>"B-a-n!" his father shouted, "B-a-n, Ban! Ban! Ban! Ban! Ban! Now go on,
if you think you know how to spell that! What comes next? Oh, you're
enough to tire the patience of Job! I've a good mind to make you learn
by the Pollard system, and begin where you leave off! Go ahead, why
don't you? Whatta you waiting for? Read on! What comes next? Why, croft,
of course; anybody ought to know that&mdash;c-r-o-f-t, croft, Bancroft! What
does that apostrophe mean? I mean, what does that punctuation mark
between t and s stand for? You don't know? Take that, then! (whack).
What comes after Bancroft? Spell it! Spell it, I tell you, and don't be
all night about it! Can't, eh? Well, read it then; if you can't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span> spell
it, read it. H-i-s-t-o-r-y-ry, history; Bancroft's History of the United
States! Now what does that spell? I mean, spell that! Spell it! Oh, go
away! Go to bed! Stupid, stupid child," he added as the little boy went
weeping out of the room, "he'll never learn anything so long as he
lives. I declare he has tired me all out, and I used to teach school in
Trivoli township, too. Taught one whole winter in district number three
when Nick Worthington was county superintendent, and had my salary&mdash;look
here, Mary, what do you find in that English grammar to giggle about?
You go to bed, too, and listen to me&mdash;if Rollo can't read that whole
book clear through without making a mistake to-morrow night, you'll wish
you had been born without a back, that's all."</p>

<p>The following morning, when Rollo's father drove away to business, he
paused a moment as Rollo stood at the gate for a final good-by kiss&mdash;for
Rollo's daily good-byes began at the door and lasted as long as his
father was in sight&mdash;Mr. Holliday said:</p>

<p>"Some day, Rollo, you will thank me for teaching you to read."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Rollo, respectfully, and then added, "but not this
day."</p>

<p>Rollo's head, though it had here and there transient bumps consequent
upon foot-ball practice, was not naturally or permanently hilly. On the
contrary, it was quite level.</p>

<h2>ELIZABETH ELIZA WRITES A PAPER</h2>

<h3>BY LUCRETIA P. HALE</h3>


<p>Elizabeth Eliza joined the Circumambient Club with the idea that it
would be a long time before she, a new member, would have to read a
paper. She would have time to hear the other papers read, and to see how
it was done; and she would find it easy when her turn came. By that time
she would have some ideas; and long before she would be called upon, she
would have leisure to sit down and write out something. But a year
passed away, and the time was drawing near. She had, meanwhile, devoted
herself to her studies, and had tried to inform herself on all subjects
by way of preparation. She had consulted one of the old members of the
Club as to the choice of a subject.</p>

<p>"Oh, write about anything," was the answer,&mdash;"anything you have been
thinking of."</p>

<p>Elizabeth Eliza was forced to say she had not been thinking lately. She
had not had time. The family had moved, and there was always an
excitement about something, that prevented her sitting down to think.</p>

<p>"Why not write on your family adventures?" asked the old member.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Eliza was sure her mother would think it made them too public;
and most of the Club papers, she observed, had some thought in them. She
preferred to find an idea.</p>

<p>So she set herself to the occupation of thinking. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span> went out on the
piazza to think; she stayed in the house to think. She tried a corner of
the china-closet. She tried thinking in the cars, and lost her
pocket-book; she tried it in the garden, and walked into the strawberry
bed. In the house and out of the house, it seemed to be the same,&mdash;she
could not think of anything to think of. For many weeks she was seen
sitting on the sofa or in the window, and nobody disturbed her. "She is
thinking about her paper," the family would say, but she only knew that
she could not think of anything.</p>

<p>Agamemnon told her that many writers waited till the last moment, when
inspiration came, which was much finer than anything studied. Elizabeth
Eliza thought it would be terrible to wait till the last moment, if the
inspiration should not come! She might combine the two ways,&mdash;wait till
a few days before the last, and then sit down and write anyhow. This
would give a chance for inspiration, while she would not run the risk of
writing nothing.</p>

<p>She was much discouraged. Perhaps she had better give it up? But, no;
everybody wrote a paper: if not now, she would have to do it some time!</p>

<p>And at last the idea of a subject came to her! But it was as hard to
find a moment to write as to think. The morning was noisy, till the
little boys had gone to school; for they had begun again upon their
regular course, with the plan of taking up the study of cider in
October. And after the little boys had gone to school, now it was one
thing, now it was another,&mdash;the china-closet to be cleaned, or one of
the neighbors in to look at the sewing-machine. She tried after dinner,
but would fall asleep. She felt that evening would be the true time,
after the cares of the day were over.</p>

<p>The Peterkins had wire mosquito-nets all over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span> house,&mdash;at every door
and every window. They were as eager to keep out the flies as the
mosquitoes. The doors were all furnished with strong springs, that
pulled the doors to as soon as they were opened. The little boys had
practised running in and out of each door, and slamming it after them.
This made a good deal of noise, for they had gained great success in
making one door slam directly after another, and at times would keep up
a running volley of artillery, as they called it, with the slamming of
the doors. Mr. Peterkin, however, preferred it to flies.</p>

<p>So Elizabeth Eliza felt she would venture to write of a summer evening
with all the windows open.</p>

<p>She seated herself one evening in the library, between two large
kerosene lamps, with paper, pen, and ink before her. It was a beautiful
night, with the smell of the roses coming in through the mosquito-nets,
and just the faintest odor of kerosene by her side. She began upon her
work. But what was her dismay! She found herself immediately surrounded
with mosquitoes. They attacked her at every point. They fell upon her
hand as she moved it to the inkstand; they hovered, buzzing, over her
head; they planted themselves under the lace of her sleeve. If she moved
her left hand to frighten them off from one point, another band fixed
themselves upon her right hand. Not only did they flutter and sting, but
they sang in a heathenish manner, distracting her attention as she tried
to write, as she tried to waft them off. Nor was this all. Myriads of
June-bugs and millers hovered round, flung themselves into the lamps,
and made disagreeable funeral-pyres of themselves, tumbling noisily on
her paper in their last unpleasant agonies. Occasionally one darted with
a rush toward Elizabeth Eliza's head.</p>

<p>If there was anything Elizabeth Eliza had a terror of it was a June-bug.
She had heard that they had a tend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>ency to get into the hair. One had
been caught in the hair of a friend of hers, who had long, luxuriant
hair. But the legs of the June-bug were caught in it like fishhooks, and
it had to be cut out, and the June-bug was only extricated by
sacrificing large masses of the flowing locks.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Eliza flung her handkerchief over her head. Could she
sacrifice what hair she had to the claims of literature? She gave a cry
of dismay.</p>

<p>The little boys rushed in a moment to the rescue. They flapped
newspapers, flung sofa-cushions; they offered to stand by her side with
fly-whisks, that she might be free to write. But the struggle was too
exciting for her, and the flying insects seemed to increase. Moths of
every description&mdash;large brown moths, small, delicate white
millers&mdash;whirled about her, while the irritating hum of the mosquito
kept on more than ever. Mr. Peterkin and the rest of the family came in
to inquire about the trouble. It was discovered that each of the little
boys had been standing in the opening of a wire door for some time,
watching to see when Elizabeth Eliza would have made her preparations
and would begin to write. Countless numbers of dorbugs and winged
creatures of every description had taken occasion to come in. It was
found that they were in every part of the house.</p>

<p>"We might open all the blinds and screens," suggested Agamemnon, "and
make a vigorous onslaught and drive them all out at once."</p>

<p>"I do believe there are more inside than out now," said Solomon John.</p>

<p>"The wire nets, of course," said Agamemnon, "keep them in now."</p>

<p>"We might go outside," proposed Solomon John, "and drive in all that are
left. Then to-morrow morning, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span> they are all torpid, kill them and
make collections of them."</p>

<p>Agamemnon had a tent which he had provided in case he should ever go to
the Adirondacks, and he proposed using it for the night. The little boys
were wild for this.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peterkin thought she and Elizabeth Eliza would prefer trying to
sleep in the house. But perhaps Elizabeth Eliza would go on with her
paper with more comfort out of doors.</p>

<p>A student's lamp was carried out, and she was established on the steps
of the back piazza, while screens were all carefully closed to prevent
the mosquitoes and insects from flying out. But it was no use. There
were outside still swarms of winged creatures that plunged themselves
about her, and she had not been there long before a huge miller flung
himself into the lamp and put it out. She gave up for the evening.</p>

<p>Still the paper went on. "How fortunate," exclaimed Elizabeth Eliza,
"that I did not put it off till the last evening!" Having once begun,
she persevered in it at every odd moment of the day. Agamemnon presented
her with a volume of "Synonymes," which was a great service to her. She
read her paper, in its various stages, to Agamemnon first, for his
criticism, then to her father in the library, then to Mr. and Mrs.
Peterkin together, next to Solomon John, and afterward to the whole
family assembled. She was almost glad that the lady from Philadelphia
was not in town, as she wished it to be her own unaided production. She
declined all invitations for the week before the night of the Club, and
on the very day she kept her room with <i>eau sucr&eacute;e</i>, that she might save
her voice. Solomon John provided her with Brown's Bronchial Troches when
the evening came, and Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span> Peterkin advised a handkerchief over her
head, in case of June-bugs.</p>

<p>It was, however, a cool night. Agamemnon escorted her to the house.</p>

<p>The Club met at Ann Maria Bromwick's. No gentlemen were admitted to the
regular meetings. There were what Solomon John called "occasional annual
meetings," to which they were invited, when all the choicest papers of
the year were re-read.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Eliza was placed at the head of the room, at a small table,
with a brilliant gas-jet on one side. It was so cool the windows could
be closed. Mrs. Peterkin, as a guest, sat in the front row.</p>

<p>This was her paper, as Elizabeth Eliza read it, for she frequently
inserted fresh expressions:&mdash;</p>


<h3>THE SUN</h3>

<p>It is impossible that much can be known about it. This is why we have
taken it up as a subject. We mean the sun that lights us by day and
leaves us by night. In the first place, it is so far off. No
measuring-tapes could reach it; and both the earth and the sun are
moving about us, that it would be difficult to adjust ladders to reach
it, if we could. Of course, people have written about it, and there are
those who have told us how many miles off it is. But it is a very large
number, with a great many figures in it; and though it is taught in most
if not all of our public schools, it is a chance if any one of the
scholars remembers exactly how much it is.</p>

<p>It is the same with its size. We can not, as we have said, reach it by
ladders to measure it; and if we did reach it, we should have no
measuring-tapes large enough, and those that shut up with springs are
difficult to use in a high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span> places. We are told, it is true, in a great
many of the school-books, the size of the sun; but, again, very few of
those who have learned the number have been able to remember it after
they have recited it, even if they remembered it then. And almost all of
the scholars have lost their school-books, or have neglected to carry
them home, and so they are not able to refer to them,&mdash;I mean, after
leaving school. I must say that is the case with me, I should say with
us, though it was different. The older ones gave their school-books to
the younger ones, who took them back to school to lose them, or who have
destroyed them when there were no younger ones to go to school. I should
say there are such families. What I mean is, the fact that in some
families there are no younger children to take off the school-books. But
even then they are put away on upper shelves, in closets or in attics,
and seldom found if wanted,&mdash;if then, dusty.</p>

<p>Of course, we all know of a class of persons called astronomers, who
might be able to give us information on the subject in hand, and who
probably do furnish what information is found in school-books. It should
be observed, however, that these astronomers carry on their observations
always in the night. Now, it is well known that the sun does not shine
in the night. Indeed, that is one of the peculiarities of the night,
that there is no sun to light us, so we have to go to bed as long as
there is nothing else we can do without its light, unless we use lamps,
gas, or kerosene, which is very well for the evening, but would be
expensive all night long; the same with candles. How, then, can we
depend upon their statements, if not made from their own observation,&mdash;I
mean, if they never saw the sun?</p>

<p>We can not expect that astronomers should give us any valuable
information with regard to the sun, which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span> never see, their
occupation compelling them to be up at night. It is quite likely that
they never see it; for we should not expect them to sit up all day as
well as all night, as, under such circumstances, their lives would not
last long.</p>

<p>Indeed, we are told that their name is taken from the word <i>aster</i>,
which means "star;" the word is "aster&mdash;know&mdash;more." This, doubtless,
means that they know more about the stars than other things. We see,
therefore, that their knowledge is confined to the stars, and we can not
trust what they have to tell us of the sun.</p>

<p>There are other asters which should not be mixed up with these,&mdash;we mean
those growing by the wayside in the fall of the year. The astronomers,
from their nocturnal habits, can scarcely be acquainted with them; but
as it does not come within our province, we will not inquire.</p>

<p>We are left, then, to seek our own information about the sun. But we are
met with a difficulty. To know a thing, we must look at it. How can we
look at the sun? It is so very bright that our eyes are dazzled in
gazing upon it. We have to turn away, or they would be put out,&mdash;the
sight, I mean. It is true, we might use smoked glass, but that is apt to
come off on the nose. How, then, if we can not look at it, can we find
out about it? The noonday would seem to be the better hour, when it is
the sunniest; but, besides injuring the eyes, it is painful to the neck
to look up for a long time. It is easy to say that our examination of
this heavenly body should take place at sunrise, when we could look at
it more on a level, without having to endanger the spine. But how many
people are up at sunrise? Those who get up early do it because they are
compelled to, and have something else to do than look at the sun.</p>

<p>The milkman goes forth to carry the daily milk, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span> ice-man to leave
the daily ice. But either of these would be afraid of exposing their
vehicles to the heating orb of day,&mdash;the milkman afraid of turning the
milk, the ice-man timorous of melting his ice&mdash;and they probably avoid
those directions where they shall meet the sun's rays. The student, who
might inform us, has been burning the midnight oil. The student is not
in the mood to consider the early sun.</p>

<p>There remains to us the evening, also,&mdash;the leisure hour of the day.
But, alas! our houses are not built with an adaptation to this subject.
They are seldom made to look toward the sunset. A careful inquiry and
close observation, such as have been called for in preparation of this
paper, have developed the fact that not a single house in this town
faces the sunset! There may be windows looking that way, but in such a
case there is always a barn between. I can testify to this from personal
observations, because, with my brothers, we have walked through the
several streets of this town with note-books, carefully noting every
house looking upon the sunset, and have found none from which the sunset
could be studied. Sometimes it was the next house, sometimes a row of
houses, or its own wood-house, that stood in the way.</p>

<p>Of course, a study of the sun might be pursued out of doors. But in
summer, sunstroke would be likely to follow; in winter, neuralgia and
cold. And how could you consult your books, your dictionaries, your
encyclop&aelig;dias? There seems to be no hour of the day for studying the
sun. You might go to the East to see it at its rising, or to the West to
gaze upon its setting, but&mdash;you don't.</p>

<p>Here Elizabeth Eliza came to a pause. She had written five different
endings, and had brought them all, thinking, when the moment came, she
would choose one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span> them. She was pausing to select one, and
inadvertently said, to close the phrase, "you don't." She had not meant
to use the expression, which she would not have thought sufficiently
imposing,&mdash;it dropped out unconsciously,&mdash;but it was received as a close
with rapturous applause.</p>

<p>She had read slowly, and now that the audience applauded at such a
length, she had time to feel she was much exhausted and glad of an end.
Why not stop there, though there were some pages more? Applause, too,
was heard from the outside. Some of the gentlemen had come,&mdash;Mr.
Peterkin, Agamemnon, and Solomon John, with others,&mdash;and demanded
admission.</p>

<p>"Since it is all over, let them in," said Ann Maria Bromwick.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Eliza assented, and rose to shake hands with her applauding
friends.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span></p>

<h2>MR. STIVER'S HORSE</h2>

<h3>BY JAMES MONTGOMERY BAILEY</h3>


<p>The other morning at breakfast Mrs. Perkins observed that Mr. Stiver, in
whose house we live, had been called away, and wanted to know if I would
see to his horse through the day.</p>

<p>I knew that Mr. Stiver owned a horse, because I occasionally saw him
drive out of the yard, and I saw the stable every day,&mdash;but what kind of
a horse I didn't know. I never went into the stable, for two reasons: in
the first place, I had no desire to; and, secondly, I didn't know as the
horse cared particularly for company.</p>

<p>I never took care of a horse in my life; and, had I been of a less
hopeful nature, the charge Mr. Stiver had left with me might have had a
very depressing effect; but I told Mrs. Perkins I would do it.</p>

<p>"You know how to take care of a horse, don't you?" said she.</p>

<p>I gave her a reassuring wink. In fact, I knew so little about it that I
didn't think it safe to converse more fluently than by winks.</p>

<p>After breakfast I seized a toothpick and walked out towards the stable.
There was nothing particular to do, as Stiver had given him his
breakfast, and I found him eating it; so I looked around. The horse
looked around, too, and stared pretty hard at me. There was but little
said on either side. I hunted up the location of the feed, and then sat
down on a peck measure and fell to studying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span> the beast. There is a wide
difference in horses. Some of them will kick you over and never look
around to see what becomes of you. I don't like a disposition like that,
and I wondered if Stiver's horse was one of them.</p>

<p>When I came home at noon I went straight to the stable. The animal was
there all right. Stiver hadn't told me what to give him for dinner, and
I had not given the subject any thought; but I went to the oat-box and
filled the peck measure and sallied boldly up to the manger.</p>

<p>When he saw the oats he almost smiled; this pleased and amused him. I
emptied them into the trough, and left him above me to admire the way I
parted my hair behind. I just got my head up in time to save the whole
of it. He had his ears back, his mouth open, and looked as if he were on
the point of committing murder. I went out and filled the measure again,
and climbed up the side of the stall and emptied it on top of him. He
brought his head up so suddenly at this that I immediately got down,
letting go of everything to do it. I struck on the sharp edge of a
barrel, rolled over a couple of times, then disappeared under a
hay-cutter. The peck measure went down on the other side, and got
mysteriously tangled up in that animal's heels, and he went to work at
it, and then ensued the most dreadful noise I ever heard in all my life,
and I have been married eighteen years.</p>

<p>It did seem as if I never would get out from under that hay-cutter; and
all the while I was struggling and wrenching myself and the cutter
apart, that awful beast was kicking around in the stall, and making the
most appalling sound imaginable.</p>

<p>When I got out I found Mrs. Perkins at the door. She had heard the
racket, and had sped out to the stable, her only thought being of me and
three stove-lids which she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span> had under her arm, and one of which she was
about to fire at the beast.</p>

<p>This made me mad.</p>

<p>"Go away, you unfortunate idiot!" I shouted: "do you want to knock my
brains out?" For I remembered seeing Mrs. Perkins sling a missile once
before, and that I nearly lost an eye by the operation, although
standing on the other side of the house at the time.</p>

<p>She retired at once. And at the same time the animal quieted down, but
there was nothing left of that peck measure, not even the maker's name.</p>

<p>I followed Mrs. Perkins into the house, and had her do me up, and then I
sat down in a chair and fell into a profound strain of meditation. After
a while I felt better, and went out to the stable again. The horse was
leaning against the stable stall, with eyes half closed, and appeared to
be very much engrossed in thought.</p>

<p>"Step off to the left," I said, rubbing his back.</p>

<p>He didn't step. I got the pitchfork and punched him in the leg with the
handle. He immediately raised up both hind legs at once, and that fork
flew out of my hands, and went rattling up against the timbers above,
and came down again in an instant, the end of the handle rapping me with
such force on the top of the head that I sat right down on the floor
under the impression that I was standing in front of a drug-store in the
evening. I went back to the house and got some more stuff on me. But I
couldn't keep away from that stable. I went out there again. The thought
struck me that what the horse wanted was exercise. If that thought had
been an empty glycerin-can, it would have saved a windfall of luck for
me.</p>

<p>But exercise would tone him down, and exercise him I should. I laughed
to myself to think how I would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span> trounce him around the yard. I didn't
laugh again that afternoon. I got him unhitched, and then wondered how I
was to get him out of the stall without carrying him out. I pushed, but
he wouldn't budge. I stood looking at him in the face, thinking of
something to say, when he suddenly solved the difficulty by veering
about and plunging for the door. I followed, as a matter of course,
because I had a tight hold on the rope, and hit about every
partition-stud worth speaking of on that side of the barn. Mrs. Perkins
was at the window and saw us come out of the door. She subsequently
remarked that we came out skipping like two innocent children. The
skipping was entirely unintentional on my part. I felt as if I stood on
the verge of eternity. My legs may have skipped, but my mind was filled
with awe.</p>

<p>I took the animal out to exercise him. He exercised me before I got
through with it. He went around a few times in a circle; then he stopped
suddenly, spread out his forelegs, and looked at me. Then he leaned
forward a little, and hoisted both hind legs, and threw about two
coal-hods of mud over a line full of clothes Mrs. Perkins had just hung
out.</p>

<p>That excellent lady had taken a position at the window, and, whenever
the evolutions of the awful beast permitted, I caught a glance of her
features. She appeared to be very much interested in the proceedings;
but the instant that the mud flew, she disappeared from the window, and
a moment later she appeared on the stoop with a long poker in her hand,
and fire enough in her eye to heat it red-hot.</p>

<p>Just then Stiver's horse stood up on his hind legs and tried to hug me
with the others. This scared me. A horse never shows his strength to
such advantage as when he is coming down on you like a frantic
pile-driver. I in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>stantly dodged, and the cold sweat fairly boiled out
of me.</p>

<p>It suddenly came over me that I had once figured in a similar position
years ago. My grandfather owned a little white horse that would get up
from a meal at Delmonico's to kick the President of the United States.
He sent me to the lot one day, and unhappily suggested that I often went
after that horse and suffered all kinds of defeat in getting him out of
the pasture, but I had never tried to ride him. Heaven knows I never
thought of it. I had my usual trouble with him that day. He tried to
jump over me, and push me down in a mud-hole, and finally got up on his
hind legs and came waltzing after me with facilities enough to convert
me into hash, but I turned and just made for that fence with all the
agony a prospect of instant death could crowd into me. If our candidate
for the Presidency had run one-half as well, there would be seventy-five
postmasters in Danbury to-day, instead of one.</p>

<p>I got him out finally, and then he was quiet enough, and I took him up
alongside the fence and got on him. He stopped an instant, one brief
instant, and then tore off down the road at a frightful speed. I lay
down on him and clasped my hands tightly around his neck, and thought of
my home. When we got to the stable I was confident he would stop, but he
didn't. He drove straight at the door. It was a low door, just high
enough to permit him to go in at lightning speed, but there was no room
for me. I saw if I struck that stable the struggle would be a very brief
one. I thought this all over in an instant, and then, spreading put my
arms and legs, emitted a scream, and the next moment I was bounding
about in the filth of that stable-yard. All this passed through my mind
as Stiver's horse went up into the air. It frightened Mrs. Perkins
dreadfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, you old fool!" she said; "why don't you get rid of him?"</p>

<p>"How can I?" said I, in desperation.</p>

<p>"Why, there are a thousand ways," said she.</p>

<p>This is just like a woman. How differently a statesman would have
answered!</p>

<p>But I could think of only two ways to dispose of the beast. I could
either swallow him where he stood and then sit down on him, or I could
crawl inside of him and kick him to death.</p>

<p>But I was saved either of these expedients by his coming towards me so
abruptly that I dropped the rope in terror, and then he turned about,
and, kicking me full of mud, shot for the gate, ripping the clothes-line
in two, and went on down the street at a horrible gallop, with two of
Mrs. Perkins' garments, which he hastily snatched from the line,
floating over his neck in a very picturesque manner.</p>

<p>So I was afterwards told. I was too full of mud myself to see the way
into the house.</p>

<p>Stiver got his horse all right, and stays at home to care for him. Mrs.
Perkins has gone to her mother's to recuperate, and I am healing as fast
as possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE CRIMSON CORD<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>

<h3>BY ELLIS PARKER BUTLER</h3>


<p>I had not seen Perkins for six months or so and things were dull. I was
beginning to tire of sitting indolently in my office with nothing to do
but clip coupons from my bonds. Money is good enough, in its way, but it
is not interesting unless it is doing something lively&mdash;doubling itself
or getting lost. What I wanted was excitement&mdash;an adventure&mdash;and I knew
that if I could find Perkins I could have both. A scheme is a business
adventure, and Perkins was the greatest schemer in or out of Chicago.</p>

<p>Just then Perkins walked into my office.</p>

<p>"Perkins," I said, as soon as he had arranged his feet comfortably on my
desk, "I'm tired. I'm restless. I have been wishing for you for a month.
I want to go into a big scheme and make a lot of new, up-to-date cash.
I'm sick of this tame, old cash that I have. It isn't interesting. No
cash is interesting except the coming cash."</p>

<p>"I'm with you," said Perkins, "what is your scheme?"</p>

<p>"I have none," I said sadly, "that is just my trouble. I have sat here
for days trying to think of a good practical scheme, but I can't. I
don't believe there is an unworked scheme in the whole wide, wide
world."</p>

<p>Perkins waved his hand.</p>

<p>"My boy," he exclaimed, "there are millions! You've thousands of 'em
right here in your office! You're falling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span> over them, sitting on them,
walking on them! Schemes? Everything is a scheme. Everything has money
in it!"</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "for you. But you are a genius."</p>

<p>"Genius, yes," Perkins said smiling cheerfully, "else why Perkins the
Great? Why Perkins the originator? Why the Great and Only Perkins of
Portland?"</p>

<p>"All right," I said, "what I want is for your genius to get busy. I'll
give you a week to work up a good scheme."</p>

<p>Perkins pushed back his hat and brought his feet to the floor with a
smack.</p>

<p>"Why the delay?" he queried, "time is money. Hand me something from your
desk."</p>

<p>I looked in my pigeonholes and pulled from one a small ball of string.
Perkins took it in his hand and looked at it with great admiration.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked seriously.</p>

<p>"That," I said humoring him, for I knew something great would be evolved
from his wonderful brain, "is a ball of red twine I bought at the
ten-cent store. I bought it last Saturday. It was sold to me by a
freckled young lady in a white shirtwaist. I paid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" Perkins cried, "what is it?"</p>

<p>I looked at the ball of twine curiously. I tried to see something
remarkable in it. I couldn't. It remained a simple ball of red twine and
I told Perkins so.</p>

<p>"The difference," declared Perkins, "between mediocrity and genius!
Mediocrity always sees red twine; genius sees a ball of Crimson Cord!"</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair and looked at me triumphantly. He folded his
arms as if he had settled the matter. His attitude seemed to say that he
had made a fortune for us. Suddenly he reached forward, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span> grasping my
scissors, began snipping off small lengths of the twine.</p>

<p>"The Crimson Cord!" he ejaculated. "What does it suggest?"</p>

<p>I told him that it suggested a parcel from the druggist's. I had often
seen just such twine about a druggist's parcel.</p>

<p>Perkins sniffed disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Druggists?" he exclaimed with disgust. "Mystery! Blood! 'The Crimson
Cord.' Daggers! Murder! Strangling! Clues! 'The Crimson Cord'&mdash;"</p>

<p>He motioned wildly with his hands as if the possibilities of the phrase
were quite beyond his power of expression.</p>

<p>"It sounds like a book," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Great!" cried Perkins. "A novel! The novel! Think of the words 'A
Crimson Cord' in blood-red letters six feet high on a white ground!" He
pulled his hat over his eyes and spread out his hands, and I think he
shuddered.</p>

<p>"Think of 'A Crimson Cord,'" he muttered, "in blood-red letters on a
ground of dead, sepulchral black, with a crimson cord writhing through
them like a serpent."</p>

<p>He sat up suddenly and threw one hand in the air.</p>

<p>"Think," he cried, "of the words in black on white with a crimson cord
drawn taut across the whole ad!"</p>

<p>He beamed upon me.</p>

<p>"The cover of the book," he said quite calmly, "will be white&mdash;virgin,
spotless white&mdash;with black lettering, and the cord in crimson. With each
copy we will give a crimson silk cord for a book-mark. Each copy will be
done up in a white box and tied with crimson cord."</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and tilted his head upward.</p>

<p>"A thick book," he said, "with deckel edges and pic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>tures by Christy.
No, pictures by Pyle. Deep, mysterious pictures! Shadows and gloom! And
wide, wide margins. And a gloomy foreword. One fifty per copy, at all
booksellers."</p>

<p>Perkins opened his eyes and set his hat straight with a quick motion of
his hand. He arose and pulled on his gloves.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Contracts!" he said. "Contracts for advertising! We must boom 'The
Crimson Cord.' We must boom her big!"</p>

<p>He went out and closed the door. Presently, when I supposed him well on
the way down town, he opened the door and inserted his head.</p>

<p>"Gilt tops," he announced. "One million copies the first impression!"</p>

<p>And then he was gone.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>A week later Chicago and the greater part of the United States was
placarded with "The Crimson Cord." Perkins did his work thoroughly and
well, and great was the interest in the mysterious title. It was an old
dodge, but a good one. Nothing appeared on the advertisements but the
mere title. No word as to what "The Crimson Cord" was. Perkins merely
announced the words and left them to rankle in the reader's mind, and as
a natural consequence each new advertisement served to excite new
interest.</p>

<p>When we made our contracts for magazine advertising&mdash;and we took a full
page in every worthy magazine&mdash;the publishers were at a loss to classify
the advertisement, and it sometimes appeared among the breakfast foods,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
and sometimes sandwiched in between the automobiles and the hot water
heaters. Only one publication placed it among the books.</p>

<p>But it was all good advertising, and Perkins was a busy man. He racked
his inventive brain for new methods of placing the title before the
public. In fact so busy was he at his labor of introducing the title
that he quite forgot the book itself.</p>

<p>One day he came to the office with a small, rectangular package. He
unwrapped it in his customary enthusiastic manner, and set on my desk a
cigar box bound in the style he had selected for the binding of "The
Crimson Cord." It was then I spoke of the advisability of having
something to the book besides the cover and a boom.</p>

<p>"Perkins," I said, "don't you think it is about time we got hold of the
novel&mdash;the reading, the words?"</p>

<p>For a moment he seemed stunned. It was clear that he had quite forgotten
that book-buyers like to have a little reading matter in their books.
But he was only dismayed for a moment.</p>

<p>"Tut!" he cried presently. "All in good time! The novel is easy.
Anything will do. I'm no literary man. I don't read a book in a year.
You get the novel."</p>

<p>"But I don't read a book in five years!" I exclaimed. "I don't know
anything about books. I don't know where to get a novel."</p>

<p>"Advertise!" he exclaimed. "Advertise! You can get anything, from an
apron to an ancestor, if you advertise for it. Offer a prize&mdash;offer a
thousand dollars for the best novel. There must be thousands of novels
not in use."</p>

<p>Perkins was right. I advertised as he suggested and learned that there
were thousands of novels not in use. They came to us by basketfuls and
cartloads. We had novels of all kinds&mdash;historical and hysterical,
humorous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span> and numerous, but particularly numerous. You would be
surprised to learn how many ready-made novels can be had on short
notice. It beats quick lunch. And most of them are equally indigestible.
I read one or two but I was no judge of novels. Perkins suggested that
we draw lots to see which we should use.</p>

<p>It really made little difference what the story was about. "The Crimson
Cord" fits almost any kind of a book. It is a nice, non-committal sort
of title, and might mean the guilt that bound two sinners, or the tie of
affection that binds lovers, or a blood relationship, or it might be a
mystification title with nothing in the book about it.</p>

<p>But the choice settled itself. One morning a manuscript arrived that was
tied with a piece of red twine, and we chose that one for good luck
because of the twine. Perkins said that was a sufficient excuse for the
title, too. We would publish the book anonymously, and let it be known
that the only clue to the writer was the crimson cord with which the
manuscript was tied when we received it. It would be a first-class
advertisement.</p>

<p>Perkins, however, was not much interested in the story, and he left me
to settle the details. I wrote to the author asking him to call, and he
turned out to be a young woman.</p>

<p>Our interview was rather shy. I was a little doubtful about the proper
way to talk to a real author, being purely a Chicagoan myself, and I had
an idea that while my usual vocabulary was good enough for business
purposes it might be too easy-going to impress a literary person
properly, and in trying to talk up to her standard I had to be very
careful in my choice of words. No publisher likes to have his authors
think he is weak in the grammar line.</p>

<p>Miss Rosa Belle Vincent, however, was quite as flus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>tered as I was. She
seemed ill-at-ease and anxious to get away, which I supposed was because
she had not often conversed with publishers who paid a thousand dollars
cash in advance for a manuscript.</p>

<p>She was not at all what I had thought an author would look like. She
didn't even wear glasses. If I had met her on the street I should have
said: "There goes a pretty flip stenographer." She was that kind&mdash;big
picture hat and high pompadour.</p>

<p>I was afraid she would try to run the talk into literary lines and Ibsen
and Gorky, where I would have been swamped in a minute, but she didn't,
and, although I had wondered how to break the subject of money when
conversing with one who must be thinking of nobler things, I found she
was less shy when on that subject than when talking about her book.</p>

<p>"Well now," I said, as soon as I had got her seated, "we have decided to
buy this novel of yours. Can you recommend it as a thoroughly
respectable and intellectual production?"</p>

<p>She said she could.</p>

<p>"Haven't you read it?" she asked in some surprise.</p>

<p>"No," I stammered. "At least, not yet. I'm going to as soon as I can
find the requisite leisure. You see, we are very busy just now&mdash;very
busy. But if you can vouch for the story being a first-class
article&mdash;something, say, like 'The Vicar of Wakefield' or 'David
Harum'&mdash;we'll take it."</p>

<p>"Now you're talking," she said. "And do I get the check now?"</p>

<p>"Wait," I said; "not so fast. I have forgotten one thing," and I saw her
face fall. "We want the privilege of publishing the novel under a title
of our own, and anonymously. If that is not satisfactory the deal is
off."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span></p>

<p>She brightened in a moment.</p>

<p>"It's a go, if that's all," she said. "Call it whatever you please, and
the more anonymous it is the better it will suit yours truly."</p>

<p>So we settled the matter then and there, and when I gave her our check
for a thousand she said I was all right.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Half an hour after Miss Vincent had left the office Perkins came in with
his arms full of bundles, which he opened, spreading their contents on
my desk.</p>

<p>He had a pair of suspenders with nickel-silver mountings, a tie, a
lady's belt, a pair of low shoes, a shirt, a box of cigars, a package of
cookies, and a half-dozen other things of divers and miscellaneous
character. I poked them over and examined them, while he leaned against
the desk with his legs crossed. He was beaming upon me.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "what is it&mdash;a bargain sale?"</p>

<p>Perkins leaned over and tapped the pile with his long fore-finger.</p>

<p>"Aftermath!" he crowed, "aftermath!"</p>

<p>"The dickens it is," I exclaimed, "and what has aftermath got to do with
this truck? It looks like the aftermath of a notion store."</p>

<p>He tipped his "Air-the-Hair" hat over one ear and put his thumbs in the
armholes of his "ready-tailored" vest.</p>

<p>"Genius!" he announced. "Brains! Foresight! Else why Perkins the Great?
Why not Perkins the Nobody?"</p>

<p>He raised the suspenders tenderly from the pile and fondled them in his
hands.</p>

<p>"See this?" he asked, running his finger along the red corded edge of
the elastic. He took up the tie and ran his nail along the red stripe
that formed the selvedge on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span> back, and said: "See this?" He pointed
to the red laces of the low shoes and asked, "See this?" And so through
the whole collection.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked. "It's genius! It's foresight."</p>

<p>He waved his hand over the pile.</p>

<p>"The aftermath!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"These suspenders are the Crimson Cord suspenders. These shoes are the
Crimson Cord shoes. This tie is the Crimson Cord tie. These crackers are
the Crimson Cord brand. Perkins &amp; Co. get out a great book, 'The Crimson
Cord!' Sell five million copies. Dramatized, it runs three hundred
nights. Everybody talking Crimson Cord. Country goes Crimson Cord crazy.
Result&mdash;up jump Crimson Cord this and Crimson Cord that. Who gets the
benefit? Perkins &amp; Co.? No! We pay the advertising bills and the other
man sells his Crimson Cord cigars. That is usual."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "I'm smoking a David Harum cigar this minute, and I am
wearing a Carvel collar."</p>

<p>"How prevent it?" asked Perkins. "One way only,&mdash;discovered by Perkins.
Copyright the words 'Crimson Cord' as trade-mark for every possible
thing. Sell the trade-mark on royalty; ten per cent. of all receipts for
'Crimson Cord' brands comes to Perkins &amp; Co. Get a cinch on the
aftermath!"</p>

<p>"Perkins!" I cried, "I admire you. You <i>are</i> a genius. And have you
contracts with all these&mdash;notions?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Perkins, "that's Perkins' method. Who originated the Crimson
Cord? Perkins did. Who is entitled to the profits on the Crimson Cord?
Perkins is. Perkins is wide awake <i>all</i> the time. Perkins gets a profit
on the aftermath and the math and the before the math."</p>

<p>And so he did. He made his new contracts with the magazines on the
exchange plan&mdash;we gave a page of ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>vertising in the "Crimson Cord" for
a page of advertising in the magazine. We guaranteed five million
circulation. We arranged with all the manufacturers of the Crimson Cord
brands of goods to give coupons, one hundred of which entitled the
holder to a copy of "The Crimson Cord." With a pair of Crimson Cord
suspenders you get five coupons; with each Crimson Cord cigar, one
coupon; and so on.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>On the first of October we announced in our advertisement that "The
Crimson Cord" was a book; the greatest novel of the century; a
thrilling, exciting tale of love. Miss Vincent had told me it was a love
story. Just to make everything sure, however, I sent the manuscript to
Professor Wiggins, who is the most erudite man I ever met. He knows
eighteen languages, and reads Egyptian as easily as I read English. In
fact his specialty is old Egyptian ruins and so on. He has written
several books on them.</p>

<p>Professor said the novel seemed to him very light and trashy, but
grammatically O.K. He said he never read novels, not having time, but he
thought that "The Crimson Cord" was just about the sort of thing a silly
public that refused to buy his "Some Light on the Dynastic Proclivities
of the Hyksos" would scramble for. On the whole I considered the report
satisfactory.</p>

<p>We found we would be unable to have Pyle illustrate the book, he being
too busy, so we turned it over to a young man at the Art Institute.</p>

<p>That was the fifteenth of October, and we had promised the book to the
public for the first of November, but we had it already in type and the
young man, his name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span> was Gilkowsky, promised to work night and day on
the illustrations.</p>

<p>The next morning, almost as soon as I reached the office, Gilkowsky came
in. He seemed a little hesitant, but I welcomed him warmly, and he spoke
up.</p>

<p>"I have a girl to go with," he said, and I wondered what I had to do
with Mr. Gilkowsky's girl, but he continued:</p>

<p>"She's a nice girl and a good looker, but she's got bad taste in some
things. She's too loud in hats, and too trashy in literature. I don't
like to say this about her, but it's true and I'm trying to educate her
in good hats and good literature. So I thought it would be a good thing
to take around this 'Crimson Cord' and let her read it to me."</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"Did she like it?" I asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilkowsky looked at me closely.</p>

<p>"She did," he said, but not so enthusiastically as I had expected.</p>

<p>"It's her favorite book. Now, I don't know what your scheme is, and I
suppose you know what you are doing better than I do; but I thought
perhaps I had better come around before I got to work on the
illustrations and see if perhaps you hadn't given me the wrong
manuscript."</p>

<p>"No, that was the right manuscript," I said. "Was there anything wrong
about it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gilkowsky laughed nervously.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" he said. "But did you read it?"</p>

<p>I told him I had not because I had been so rushed with details connected
with advertising the book.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I'll tell you. This girl of mine reads pretty trashy
stuff, and she knows about all the cheap novels there are. She dotes on
'The Duchess,' and puts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span> her last dime into Braddon. She knows them all
by heart. Have you ever read 'Lady Audley's Secret'?"</p>

<p>"I see," I said. "One is a sequel to the other."</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Gilkowsky. "One is the other. Some one has flim-flammed
you and sold you a typewritten copy of 'Lady Audley's Secret' as a new
novel."</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>When I told Perkins he merely remarked that he thought every publishing
house ought to have some one in it who knew something about books, apart
from the advertising end, although that was, of course, the most
important. He said we might go ahead and publish "Lady Audley's Secret"
under the title of "The Crimson Cord," as such things had been done
before, but the best thing to do would be to charge Rosa Belle Vincent's
thousand dollars to Profit and Loss and hustle for another
novel&mdash;something reliable and not shop-worn.</p>

<p>Perkins had been studying the literature market a little and he advised
me to get something from Indiana this time, so I telegraphed an
advertisement to the Indianapolis papers and two days later we had
ninety-eight historical novels by Indiana authors from which to choose.
Several were of the right length, and we chose one and sent it to Mr.
Gilkowsky with a request that he read it to his sweetheart. She had
never read it before.</p>

<p>We sent a detective to Dillville, Indiana, where the author lived, and
the report we received was most satisfactory.</p>

<p>The author was a sober, industrious young man, just out of the high
school, and bore a first-class reputation for honesty. He had never been
in Virginia, where the scene of his story was laid, and they had no
library in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span> Dillville, and our detective assured us that the young man
was in every way fitted to write a historical novel.</p>

<p>"The Crimson Cord" made an immense success. You can guess how it boomed
when I say that although it was published at a dollar and a half, it was
sold by every department store for fifty-four cents, away below cost,
just like sugar, or Vandeventer's Baby Food, or Q &amp; Z Corsets, or any
other staple. We sold our first edition of five million copies inside of
three months, and got out another edition of two million, and a
specially illustrated holiday edition and an <i>edition de luxe</i>, and "The
Crimson Cord" is still selling in paper-covered cheap edition.</p>

<p>With the royalties received from the aftermath and the profit on the
book itself, we made&mdash;well, Perkins has a country place at Lakewood, and
I have my cottage at Newport.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span></p>

<h2>MORRIS AND THE HONORABLE TIM<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></h2>

<h3>BY MYRA KELLY</h3>


<p>On the first day of school, after the Christmas holidays, teacher found
herself surrounded by a howling mob of little savages in which she had
much difficulty in recognizing her cherished First-Reader Class. Isidore
Belchatosky's face was so wreathed in smiles and foreign matter as to be
beyond identification; Nathan Spiderwitz had placed all his trust in a
solitary suspender and two unstable buttons; Eva Kidansky had entirely
freed herself from restraining hooks and eyes; Isidore Applebaum had
discarded shoe-laces; and Abie Ashnewsky had bartered his only necktie
for a yard of "shoe-string" licorice.</p>

<p>Miss Bailey was greatly disheartened by this reversion to the original
type. She delivered daily lectures on nail-brushes, hair-ribbons, shoe
polish, pins, buttons, elastic, and other means to grace. Her talks on
soap and water became almost personal in tone, and her insistence on a
close union between such garments as were meant to be united, led to a
lively traffic in twisted and disreputable safety-pins. And yet the
First-Reader Class, in all other branches of learning so receptive and
responsive, made but halting and uncertain progress toward that state of
virtue which is next to godliness.</p>

<p>Early in January came the report that "Gum Shoe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span> Tim" was on the
war-path and might be expected at any time. Miss Bailey heard the
tidings in calm ignorance until Miss Blake, who ruled over the adjoining
kingdom, interpreted the warning. A license to teach in the public
schools of New York is good for only one year. Its renewal depends upon
the reports of the Principal in charge of the school and of the
Associate Superintendent in whose district the school chances to be.
After three such renewals the license becomes permanent, but Miss Bailey
was, as a teacher, barely four months old. The Associate Superintendent
for her vicinity was the Honorable Timothy O'Shea, known and dreaded as
"Gum Shoe Tim," owing to his engaging way of creeping softly up
back-stairs and appearing, all unheralded and unwelcome, upon the
threshold of his intended victim.</p>

<p>This, Miss Blake explained, was in defiance of all the rules of
etiquette governing such visits of inspection. The proper procedure had
been that of Mr. O'Shea's predecessor, who had always given timely
notice of his coming and a hint as to the subjects in which he intended
to examine the children. Some days later he would amble from room to
room, accompanied by the amiable Principal, and followed by the
gratitude of smiling and unruffled teachers.</p>

<p>This kind old gentleman was now retired and had been succeeded by Mr.
O'Shea, who, in addition to his unexpectedness, was adorned by an
abominable temper, an overbearing manner, and a sense of cruel humor. He
had almost finished his examinations at the nearest school where, during
a brisk campaign of eight days, he had caused five dismissals, nine
cases of nervous exhaustion, and an epidemic of hysteria.</p>

<p>Day by day nerves grew more tense, tempers more unsure, sleep and
appetite more fugitive. Experienced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span> teachers went stolidly on with the
ordinary routine, while beginners devoted time and energy to the more
spectacular portions of the curriculum. But no one knew the Honorable
Timothy's pet subjects, and so no one could specialize to any great
extent.</p>

<p>Miss Bailey was one of the beginners, and Room 18 was made to shine as
the sun. Morris Mogilewsky, Monitor of the Gold-Fish Bowl, wrought
busily until his charges glowed redly against the water plants in their
shining bowl. Creepers crept, plants grew, and ferns waved under the
care of Nathan Spiderwitz, Monitor of the Window Boxes. There was such a
martial swing and strut in Patrick Brennan's leadership of the line that
it inflamed even the timid heart of Isidore Wishnewsky with a war-like
glow and his feet with a spasmodic but well-meant tramp. Sadie
Gonorowsky and Eva, her cousin, sat closely side by side, no longer "mad
on theirselves," but "mit kind feelings." The work of the preceding term
was laid in neat and docketed piles upon the low book-case. The children
were enjoined to keep clean and entire. And Teacher, a nervous and
unsmiling Teacher, waited dully.</p>

<p>A week passed thus, and then the good-hearted and experienced Miss Blake
hurried ponderously across the hall to put Teacher on her guard.</p>

<p>"I've just had a note from one of the grammar teachers," she panted.
"'Gum Shoe Tim' is up in Miss Green's room! He'll take this floor next.
Now, see here, child, don't look so frightened. The Principal is with
Tim. Of course you're nervous, but try not to show it, and you'll be all
right. His lay is discipline and reading. Well, good luck to you!"</p>

<p>Miss Bailey took heart of grace. The children read surprisingly well,
were absolutely good, and the enemy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span> under convoy of the friendly
Principal would be much less terrifying than the enemy at large and
alone. It was, therefore, with a manner almost serene that she turned to
greet the kindly concerned Principal and the dreaded "Gum Shoe Tim." The
latter she found less ominous of aspect than she had been led to fear,
and the Principal's charming little speech of introduction made her
flush with quick pleasure. And the anxious eyes of Sadie Gonorowsky,
noting the flush, grew calm as Sadie whispered to Eva, her close cousin:</p>

<p>"Say, Teacher has a glad. She's red on the face. It could to be her
papa."</p>

<p>"No. It's comp'ny," answered Eva sagely. "It ain't her papa. It's
comp'ny the whiles Teacher takes him by the hand."</p>

<p>The children were not in the least disconcerted by the presence of the
large man. They always enjoyed visitors, and they liked the heavy gold
chain which festooned the wide waistcoat of this guest; and, as they
watched him, the Associate Superintendent began to superintend.</p>

<p>He looked at the children all in their clean and smiling rows; he looked
at the flowers and the gold-fish; at the pictures and the plaster casts;
he looked at the work of the last term and he looked at Teacher. As he
looked he swayed gently on his rubber heels and decided that he was
going to enjoy the coming quarter of an hour. Teacher pleased him from
the first. She was neither old nor ill-favored, and she was most
evidently nervous. The combination appealed both to his love of power
and his peculiar sense of humor. Settling deliberately in the chair of
state, he began:</p>

<p>"Can the children sing, Miss Bailey?"</p>

<p>They could sing very prettily and they did.</p>

<p>"Very nice, indeed," said the voice of visiting author<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>ity. "Very nice.
Their music is exceptionally good. And are they drilled? Children, will
you march for me?"</p>

<p>Again they could and did. Patrick marshaled his line in time and triumph
up and down the aisles to the evident interest and approval of the
"comp'ny," and then Teacher led the class through some very energetic
Swedish movements. While arms and bodies were bending and straightening
at Teacher's command and example, the door opened and a breathless boy
rushed in. He bore an unfolded note and, as Teacher had no hand to
spare, the boy placed the paper on the desk under the softening eyes of
the Honorable Timothy, who glanced down idly and then pounced upon the
note and read its every word.</p>

<p>"For you, Miss Bailey," he said in the voice before which even the
school janitor had been known to quail. "Your friend was thoughtful,
though a little late." And poor palpitating Miss Bailey read:</p>

<p>"Watch out! 'Gum Shoe Tim' is in the building. The Principal caught him
on the back-stairs, and they're going round together. He's as cross as a
bear. Greene in dead faint in the dressing-room. Says he's going to fire
her. Watch out for him, and send the news on. His lay is reading and
discipline."</p>

<p>Miss Bailey grew cold with sick and unreasoning fear. As she gazed
wide-eyed at the living confirmation of the statement that "Gum Shoe
Tim" was "as cross as a bear," the gentle-hearted Principal took the
paper from her nerveless grasp.</p>

<p>"It's all right," he assured her. "Mr. O'Shea understands that you had
no part in this. It's all right. You are not responsible."</p>

<p>But Teacher had no ears for his soothing. She could only watch with
fascinated eyes as the Honorable Timothy reclaimed the note and wrote
across it's damning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span> face: "Miss Greene may come to. She is not
fired.&mdash;T. O'S."</p>

<p>"Here, boy," he called; "take this to your teacher." The puzzled
messenger turned to obey, and the Associate Superintendent saw that
though his dignity had suffered his power had increased. To the list of
those whom he might, if so disposed, devour, he had now added the name
of the Principal, who was quick to understand that an unpleasant
investigation lay before him. If Miss Bailey could not be held
responsible for this system of inter-classroom communication, it was
clear that the Principal could.</p>

<p>Every trace of interest had left Mr. O'Shea's voice as he asked:</p>

<p>"Can they read?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they read," responded Teacher, but her spirit was crushed and
the children reflected her depression. Still, they were marvelously good
and that blundering note had said, "Discipline is his lay." Well, here
he had it.</p>

<p>There was one spectator of this drama, who, understanding no word nor
incident therein, yet dismissed no shade of the many emotions which had
stirred the light face of his lady. Toward the front of the room sat
Morris Mogilewsky, with every nerve tuned to Teacher's, and with an
appreciation of the situation in which the other children had no share.
On the afternoon of one of those dreary days of waiting for the evil
which had now come, Teacher had endeavored to explain the nature and
possible result of this ordeal to her favorite. It was clear to him now
that she was troubled, and he held the large and unaccustomed presence
of the "comp'ny mit whiskers" responsible. Countless generations of
ancestors had followed and fostered the instinct which now led Morris to
propitiate an angry power. Luckily, he was prepared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span> with an offering of
a suitable nature. He had meant to enjoy it for yet a few days, and then
to give it to Teacher. She was such a sensible person about presents.
One might give her one's most cherished possession with a brave and
cordial heart, for on each Friday afternoon she returned the gifts she
had received during the week. And this with no abatement of gratitude.</p>

<p>Morris rose stealthily, crept forward, and placed a bright blue
bromo-seltzer bottle in the fat hand which hung over the back of the
chair of state. The hand closed instinctively as, with dawning
curiosity, the Honorable Timothy studied the small figure at his side.
It began in a wealth of loosely curling hair which shaded a delicate
face, very pointed as to chin and monopolized by a pair of dark eyes,
sad and deep and beautiful. A faded blue "jumper" was buttoned tightly
across the narrow chest; frayed trousers were precariously attached to
the "jumper," and impossible shoes and stockings supplemented the
trousers. Glancing from boy to bottle, the "comp'ny mit whiskers" asked:</p>

<p>"What's this for?"</p>

<p>"For you."</p>

<p>"What's in it?"</p>

<p>"A present."</p>

<p>Mr. O'Shea removed the cork and proceeded to draw out incredible
quantities of absorbent cotton. When there was no more to come, a faint
tinkle sounded within the blue depths, and Mr. O'Shea, reversing the
bottle, found himself possessed of a trampled and disfigured sleeve link
of most palpable brass.</p>

<p>"It's from gold," Morris assured him. "You puts it in your&mdash;'scuse
me&mdash;shirt. Wish you health to wear it."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the Honorable Tim, and there was a tiny break in the
gloom which had enveloped him. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span> then, with a quick memory of the
note and of his anger:</p>

<p>"Miss Bailey, who is this young man?"</p>

<p>And Teacher, of whose hobbies Morris was one, answered warmly: "That is
Morris Mogilewsky, the best of boys. He takes care of the gold-fish, and
does all sorts of things for me. Don't you, dear?"</p>

<p>"Teacher, yiss ma'an," Morris answered. "I'm lovin' much mit you. I
gives presents on the comp'ny over you."</p>

<p>"Ain't he rather big to speak such broken English?" asked Mr. O'Shea. "I
hope you remember that it is part of your duty to stamp out the
dialect."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," Miss Bailey answered. "But Morris has been in America for
so short a time. Nine months, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Teacher, yiss ma'an. I comes out of Russia," responded Morris, on the
verge of tears and with his face buried in Teacher's dress.</p>

<p>Now Mr. O'Shea had his prejudices&mdash;strong and deep. He had been given
jurisdiction over that particular district because it was his native
heath, and the Board of Education considered that he would be more in
sympathy with the inhabitants than a stranger. The truth was absolutely
the reverse. Because he had spent his early years in a large old house
on East Broadway, because he now saw his birthplace changed to a squalid
tenement, and the happy hunting grounds of his youth grown ragged and
foreign&mdash;swarming with strange faces and noisy with strange tongues&mdash;Mr.
O'Shea bore a sullen grudge against the usurping race.</p>

<p>He resented the caressing air with which Teacher held the little hand
placed so confidently within her own and he welcomed the opportunity of
gratifying his still ruffled temper and his racial antagonism at the
same time. He would take a rise out of this young woman about her
lit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>tle Jew. She would be comforted later on. Mr. O'Shea rather fancied
himself in the r&ocirc;le of comforter, when the sufferer was neither old nor
ill-favored. And so he set about creating the distress which he would
later change to gratitude and joy. Assuredly the Honorable Timothy had a
well-developed sense of humor.</p>

<p>"His English is certainly dreadful," remarked the voice of authority,
and it was not an English voice, nor is O'Shea distinctively an English
name. "Dreadful. And, by the way, I hope you are not spoiling these
youngsters. You must remember that you are fitting them for the battle
of life. Don't coddle your soldiers. Can you reconcile your present
attitude with discipline?"</p>

<p>"With Morris&mdash;yes," Teacher answered. "He is gentle and tractable beyond
words."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you're right," grunted Mr. O'Shea, "but don't coddle
them."</p>

<p>And so the incident closed. The sleeve link was tucked, before Morris's
yearning eyes, into the reluctant pocket of the wide white waistcoat,
and Morris returned to his place. He found his reader and the proper
page, and the lesson went on with brisk serenity; real on the children's
part, but bravely assumed on Teacher's. Child after child stood up,
read, sat down again, and it came to be the duty of Bertha Binderwitz to
read the entire page of which the others had each read a line. She began
jubilantly, but soon stumbled, hesitated, and wailed:</p>

<p>"Stands a fierce word. I don't know what it is," and Teacher turned to
write the puzzling word upon the blackboard.</p>

<p>Morris's heart stopped with a sickening suddenness and then rushed madly
on again. He had a new and dreadful duty to perform. All his mother's
counsel, all his father's precepts told him that it was his duty. Yet
fear held him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span> in his little seat behind his little desk, while his
conscience insisted on this unalterable decree of the social code: "So
somebody's clothes is wrong it's polite you says ''scuse' and tells it
out."</p>

<p>And here was Teacher whom he dearly loved, whose ideals of personal
adornment extended to full sets of buttons on jumpers and to laces in
both shoes, here was his immaculate lady fair in urgent need of
assistance and advice, and all because she had on that day inaugurated a
delightfully vigorous exercise for which, architecturally, she was not
designed.</p>

<p>There was yet room for hope that some one else would see the breach and
brave the danger. But no. The visitor sat stolidly in the chair of
state, the Principal sat serenely beside him, the children sat each in
his own little place, behind his own little desk, keeping his own little
eyes on his own little book. No. Morris's soul cried with Hamlet's:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The time is out of joint;&mdash;O cursed spite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ever I was born to set it right!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Up into the quiet air went his timid hand. Teacher, knowing him in his
more garrulous moods, ignored the threatened interruption of Bertha's
spirited r&eacute;sum&eacute;, but the windmill action of the little arm attracted the
Honorable Tim's attention.</p>

<p>"The best of boys wants you," he suggested, and Teacher perforce asked:</p>

<p>"Well, Morris, what is it?"</p>

<p>Not until he was on his feet did the Monitor of the Gold-Fish Bowl
appreciate the enormity of the mission he had undertaken. The other
children began to understand, and watched his struggle for words and
breath with sympathy or derision, as their natures prompted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span> But there
are no words in which one may politely mention ineffective safety-pins
to one's glass of fashion. Morris's knees trembled queerly, his
breathing grew difficult, and Teacher seemed a very great way off as she
asked again:</p>

<p>"Well, what is it, dear?"</p>

<p>Morris panted a little, smiled weakly, and then sat down. Teacher was
evidently puzzled, the "comp'ny" alert, the Principal uneasy.</p>

<p>"Now, Morris," Teacher remonstrated, "you must tell me what you want."</p>

<p>But Morris had deserted his etiquette and his veracity, and murmured
only:</p>

<p>"Nothings."</p>

<p>"Just wanted to be noticed," said the Honorable Tim. "It is easy to
spoil them." And he watched the best of boys rather closely, for a habit
of interrupting reading lessons, wantonly and without reason, was a
trait in the young of which he disapproved.</p>

<p>When this disapprobation manifested itself in Mr. O'Shea's countenance,
the loyal heart of Morris interpreted it as a new menace to his
sovereign. No later than yesterday she had warned them of the vital
importance of coherence. "Every one knows," she had said, "that only
common little boys and girls come apart. No one ever likes them," and
the big stranger was even now misjudging her.</p>

<p>Again his short arm agitated the quiet air. Again his trembling legs
upheld a trembling boy. Again authority urged. Again Teacher asked:</p>

<p>"Well, Morris, what is it, dear?"</p>

<p>All this was as before, but not as before was poor harassed Miss
Bailey's swoop down the aisle, her sudden taking Morris's troubled
little face between her soft<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span> hands, the quick near meeting with her
kind eyes, the note of pleading in her repetition:</p>

<p>"What do you want, Morris?"</p>

<p>He was beginning to answer when it occurred to him that the truth might
make her cry. There was an unsteadiness about her upper lip which seemed
to indicate the possibility. Suddenly he found that he no longer yearned
for words in which to tell her of her disjointment, but for something
else&mdash;anything else&mdash;to say.</p>

<p>His miserable eyes escaped from hers and wandered to the wall in
desperate search for conversation. There was no help in the pictures, no
inspiration in the plaster casts, but on the blackboard he read,
"Tuesday, January twenty-first, 1902." Only the date, but he must make
it serve. With teacher close beside him, with the hostile eye of the
Honorable Tim upon him, hedged round about by the frightened or admiring
regard of the First-Reader Class, Morris blinked rapidly, swallowed
resolutely, and remarked:</p>

<p>"Teacher, this year's Nineteen-hundred-and-two," and knew that all was
over.</p>

<p>The caressing clasp of Teacher's hands grew into a grip of anger. The
countenance of Mr. O'Shea took on the beautiful expression of the
prophet who has found honor and verification in his own country.</p>

<p>"The best of boys has his off days and this is one of them," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"Morris," said Teacher, "did you stop a reading lesson to tell me that?
Do you think I don't know what the year is? I'm ashamed of you."</p>

<p>Never had she spoken thus. If the telling had been difficult to Morris
when she was "glad on him," it was impossible now that she was a prey to
such evident "mad feelings." And yet he must make some explanation. So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
he murmured: "Teacher, I tells you 'scuse. I know you knows what year
stands, on'y it's polite I tells you something, und I had a fraid."</p>

<p>"And so you bothered your Teacher with that nonsense," said Tim. "You're
a nice boy!"</p>

<p>Morris's eyes were hardly more appealing than Teacher's as the two
culprits, for so they felt themselves, turned to their judge.</p>

<p>"Morris is a strange boy," Miss Bailey explained. "He can't be managed
by ordinary methods&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And extraordinary methods don't seem to work to-day," Mr. O'Shea
interjected.</p>

<p>"And I think," Teacher continued, "that it might be better not to press
the point."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you have no control over him&mdash;" Mr. O'Shea was beginning
pleasantly, when the Principal suggested:</p>

<p>"You'd better let us hear what he has to say, Miss Bailey; make him
understand that you are master here." And Teacher, with a heart-sick
laugh at the irony of this advice in the presence of the Associate
Superintendent, turned to obey.</p>

<p>But Morris would utter no words but these, dozens of times repeated: "I
have a fraid." Miss Bailey coaxed, bribed, threatened and cajoled; shook
him surreptitiously, petted him openly. The result was always the same:
"It's polite I tells you something out, on'y I had a fraid."</p>

<p>"But, Morris, dear, of what?" cried Teacher. "Are you afraid of me? Stop
crying now and answer. Are you afraid of Miss Bailey?"</p>

<p>"N-o-o-oh m-a-a-an."</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of the Principal?"</p>

<p>"N-o-o-oh m-a-a-an."</p>

<p>"Are you afraid,"&mdash;with a slight pause, during which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span> a native hue of
honesty was foully done to death&mdash;"of the kind gentleman we are all so
glad to see?"</p>

<p>"N-o-o-oh m-a-a-an."</p>

<p>"Well, then what is the matter with you? Are you sick? Don't you think
you would like to go home to your mother?"</p>

<p>"No-o-o-oh m-a-a-an; I ain't sick. I tells you 'scuse."</p>

<p>The repeated imitation of a sorrowful goat was too much for the
Honorable Tim.</p>

<p>"Bring that boy to me," he commanded. "I'll show you how to manage
refractory and rebellious children."</p>

<p>With much difficulty and many assurances that the gentleman was not
going to hurt him, Miss Bailey succeeded in untwining Morris's legs from
the supports of the desk and in half carrying, half leading him up to
the chair of state. An ominous silence had settled over the room. Eva
Gonorowsky was weeping softly, and the redoubtable Isidore Applebaum was
stiffened in a frozen calm.</p>

<p>"Morris," began the Associate Superintendent in his most awful tones,
"will you tell me why you raised your hand? Come here, sir."</p>

<p>Teacher urged him gently, and like dog to heel, he went. He halted
within a pace or two of Mr. O'Shea, and lifted a beseeching face toward
him.</p>

<p>"I couldn't to tell nothing out," said he. "I tells you 'scuse. I'm got
a fraid."</p>

<p>The Honorable Tim lunged quickly and caught the terrified boy
preparatory to shaking him, but Morris escaped and fled to his haven of
safety&mdash;his Teacher's arms. When Miss Bailey felt the quick clasp of the
thin little hands, the heavy beating of the over-tired heart, and the
deep convulsive sobs, she turned on the Honorable Timothy O'Shea and
spoke:</p>

<p>"I must ask you to leave this room at once," she an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>nounced. The
Principal started and then sat back. Teacher's eyes were dangerous, and
the Honorable Tim might profit by a lesson. "You've frightened the child
until he can't breathe. I can do nothing with him while you remain. The
examination is ended. You may go."</p>

<p>Now Mr. O'Shea saw he had gone a little too far in his effort to create
the proper dramatic setting for his clemency. He had not expected the
young woman to "rise" quite so far and high. His deprecating
half-apology, half-eulogy, gave Morris the opportunity he craved.</p>

<p>"Teacher," he panted; "I wants to whisper mit you in the ear."</p>

<p>With a dexterous movement he knelt upon her lap and tore out his
solitary safety-pin. He then clasped her tightly and made his
explanation. He began in the softest of whispers, which increased in
volume as it did in interest, so that he reached the climax at the full
power of his boy soprano voice.</p>

<p>"Teacher, Missis Bailey, I know you know what year stands. On'y it's
polite I tells you something, und I had a fraid the while the 'comp'ny
mit the whiskers' sets und rubbers. But, Teacher, it's like this: your
jumper's sticking out und you could to take mine safety-pin."</p>

<p>He had understood so little of all that had passed that he was beyond
being surprised by the result of this communication. Miss Bailey had
gathered him into her arms and had cried in a queer helpless way. And as
she cried she had said over and over again: "Morris, how could you? Oh,
how could you, dear? How could you?"</p>

<p>The Principal and "the comp'ny mit whiskers" looked solemnly at one
another for a struggling moment, and had then broken into laughter, long
and loud, until the visiting authority was limp and moist. The children
waited in polite uncertainty, but when Miss Bailey, after some
in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>decision, had contributed a wan smile, which later grew into a shaky
laugh, the First-Reader Class went wild.</p>

<p>Then the Honorable Timothy arose to say good-by. He reiterated his
praise of the singing and reading, the blackboard work and the moral
tone. An awkward pause ensued, during which the Principal engaged the
young Gonorowskys in impromptu conversation. The Honorable Tim crossed
over to Miss Bailey's side and steadied himself for a great effort.</p>

<p>"Teacher," he began meekly, "I tells you 'scuse. This sort of thing
makes a man feel like a bull in a china shop. Do you think the little
fellow will shake hands with me? I was really only joking."</p>

<p>"But surely he will," said Miss Bailey, as she glanced down at the
tangle of dark curls resting against her breast. "Morris, dear, aren't
you going to say good-by to the gentleman?"</p>

<p>Morris relaxed one hand from its grasp on his lady and bestowed it on
Mr. O'Shea.</p>

<p>"Good-by," said he gently. "I gives you presents, from gold presents,
the while you're friends mit Teacher. I'm loving much mit her, too."</p>

<p>At this moment the Principal turned, and Mr. O'Shea, in a desperate
attempt to retrieve his dignity, began: "As to class management and
discipline&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the Principal was not to be deceived.</p>

<p>"Don't you think, Mr. O'Shea," said he, "that you and I had better leave
the management of the little ones to the women? You have noticed,
perhaps, that this is Nature's method."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE GENIAL IDIOT SUGGESTS A COMIC OPERA</h2>

<h3>BY JOHN KENDRICK BANGS</h3>


<p>"There's a harvest for you," said the Idiot, as he perused a recently
published criticism of a comic opera. "There have been thirty-nine new
comic operas produced this year and four of 'em were worth seeing. It is
very evident that the Gilbert and Sullivan industry hasn't gone to the
wall whatever slumps other enterprises have suffered from."</p>

<p>"That is a goodly number," said the Poet. "Thirty-nine, eh? I knew there
was a raft of them, but I had no idea there were as many as that."</p>

<p>"Why don't you go in and do one, Mr. Poet?" suggested the Idiot. "They
tell me it's as easy as rolling off a log. All you've got to do is to
forget all your ideas and remember all the old jokes you ever heard.
Slap 'em together around a lot of dances, write two dozen lyrics about
some Googoo Belle, hire a composer, and there you are. Hanged if I
haven't thought of writing one myself."</p>

<p>"I fancy it isn't as easy as it looks," observed the Poet. "It requires
just as much thought to be thoughtless as it does to be thoughtful."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said the Idiot. "I'd undertake the job cheerfully if some
manager would make it worth my while, and what's more, if I ever got
into the swing of the business I'll bet I could turn out a libretto a
day for three days of the week for the next two months."</p>

<p>"If I had your confidence I'd try it," laughed the Poet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span> "but alas, in
making me Nature did not design a confidence man."</p>

<p>"Nonsense again," said the Idiot. "Any man who can get the editors to
print Sonnets to Diana's Eyebrow, and little lyrics of Madison Square,
Longacre Square, Battery Place and Boston Common, the way you do, has a
right to consider himself an adept at bunco. I tell you what I'll do
with you. I'll swap off my confidence for your lyrical facility and see
what I can do. Why can't we collaborate and get up a libretto for next
season? They tell me there's large money in it."</p>

<p>"There certainly is if you catch on," said the Poet. "Vastly more than
in any other kind of writing that I know. I don't know but that I would
like to collaborate with you on something of the sort. What is your
idea?"</p>

<p>"Mind's a blank on the subject," sighed the Idiot. "That's the reason I
think I can turn the trick. As I said before, you don't need ideas.
Better off without 'em. Just sit down and write."</p>

<p>"But you must have some kind of a story," persisted the Poet.</p>

<p>"Not to begin with," said the Idiot. "Just write your choruses and
songs, slap in your jokes, fasten 'em together, and the thing is done.
First act, get your hero and heroine into trouble. Second act, get 'em
out."</p>

<p>"And for the third?" queried the Poet.</p>

<p>"Don't have a third," said the Idiot. "A third is always
superfluous&mdash;but if you must have it, make up some kind of a vaudeville
show and stick it in between the first and second."</p>

<p>"Tush!" said the Bibliomaniac. "That would make a gay comic opera."</p>

<p>"Of course it would, Mr. Bib," the Idiot agreed. "And that's what we
want. If there's anything in this world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span> that I hate more than another
it is a sombre comic opera. I've been to a lot of 'em, and I give you my
word of honor that next to a funeral a comic opera that lacks gaiety is
one of the most depressing functions known to modern science. Some of
'em are enough to make an undertaker weep with jealous rage. I went to
one of 'em last week called 'The Skylark' with an old chum of mine, who
is a surgeon. You can imagine what sort of a thing it was when I tell
you that after the first act he suggested we leave the theater and come
back here and have some fun cutting my leg off. He vowed that if he ever
went to another opera by the same people he'd take ether beforehand."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think that would be necessary," sneered the Bibliomaniac.
"If it was as bad as all that why didn't it put you to sleep?"</p>

<p>"It did," said the Idiot. "But the music kept waking us up again. There
was no escape from it except that of actual physical flight."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;about this collaboration of ours," suggested the Poet. "What do
you think we should do first?"</p>

<p>"Write an opening chorus, of course," said the Idiot. "What did you
suppose? A finale? Something like this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If you want to know who we are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just ask the Evening Star,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As he smiles on high<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In the deep blue sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his tralala-la-la-la.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We are maidens sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tripping feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Googoo eyes<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the smile of the fair Gazoo;<br /></span>

<p>"Get that sung with spirit by sixty-five ladies with blonde wigs and
gold slippers, otherwise dressed up in the uniform of a troop of Russian
Cavalry, and you've got your venture launched."</p>

<p>"Where can you find people like that?" asked the Bibliomaniac.</p>

<p>"New York's full of 'em," replied the Idiot.</p>

<p>"I don't mean the people to act that sort of thing&mdash;but where would you
lay your scene?" explained the Bibliomaniac.</p>

<p>"Oh, any old place in the Pacific Ocean," said the Idiot. "Make your own
geography&mdash;everybody else does. There's a million islands out there of
one kind or another, and as defenseless as a two weeks' old infant. If
you want a real one, fish it out and fire ahead. If you don't, make one
up for yourself and call it 'The Isle of Piccolo,' or something of that
sort. After you've got your chorus going, introduce your villain, who
should be a man with a deep bass voice and a piratical past. He's the
chap who rules the roost and is going to marry the heroine to-morrow.
That will make a bully song:</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span></div></div>

<p>"Gee!" added the Idiot enthusiastically. "Can't you almost hear that
already?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say," said Mr. Brief, "that I can. You ought to call your
heroine Drivelina."</p>

<p>"Splendid," cried the Idiot. "Drivelina goes. Well, then on comes
Drivelina and this beast of a Pirate grabs her by the hand and makes
love to her as if he thought wooing was a game of snap the whip. She
sings a soprano solo of protest and the Pirate summons his hirelings to
cast Drivelina into a Donjuan cell when, boom! an American warship
appears on the horizon. The crew under the leadership of a man with a
squeaky tenor voice named Lieutenant Somebody or other comes ashore,
puts Drivelina under the protection of the American flag while his crew
sings the following:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"We are Jackies, Jackies, Jackies,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">And we smoke the best tobaccys<br /></span>

<span class="i0">You can bet your life that that's the thing to doodle&mdash;doodle&mdash;doodle&mdash;doodle-do.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Eh! What?" demanded the Idiot.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what yourself?" asked the Lawyer. "This is your job. What next?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;the Pirate gets lively, tries to assassinate the Lieutenant, who
kills half the natives with his sword and is about to slay the Pirate
when he discovers that he is his long lost father," said the Idiot. "The
heroine then sings a pathetic love song about her Baboon Baby, in a
green light to the accompaniment of a lot of pink satin monkeys banging
cocoa-nut shells together. This drowsy lullaby puts the Lieutenant and
his forces to sleep and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span> curtain falls on their capture by the
Pirate and his followers, with the chorus singing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hooray for the Pirate bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his pockets full of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's going to marry to-morrow.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">To-morrow he'll marry,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Yes, by the Lord Harry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's go-ing&mdash;to-marry&mdash;to-mor-row!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that's a thing to doodle-doodle-doo.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"There," said the Idiot, after a pause. "How is that for a first act?"</p>

<p>"It's about as lucid as most of them," said the Poet, "but after all you
have got a story there, and you said you didn't need one."</p>

<p>"I said you didn't need one to start with," corrected the Idiot. "And
I've proved it. I didn't have that story in mind when I started. That's
where the easiness of the thing comes in. Why, I didn't even have to
think of a name for the heroine. The inspiration for that popped right
out of Mr. Brief's mouth as smoothly as though the name Drivelina had
been written on his heart for centuries. Then the title&mdash;Isle of
Piccolo&mdash;that's a dandy and I give you my word of honor I'd never even
thought of a title for the opera until that revealed itself like a flash
from the blue; and as for the coon song, 'My Baboon Baby,' there's a
chance there for a Zanzibar act that will simply make Richard Wagner and
Reginald De Koven writhe with jealousy. Can't you imagine the lilt of
it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"My Bab-boon&mdash;ba-habee,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">My Bab-boon&mdash;ba-habee&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i6">Yes dee-hee-hee-er-lee.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">My Baboon&mdash;ba-ha-bee,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">My Baboon&mdash;ba-ha-bee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My baboon&mdash;Ba-hay-hay-hay-hay-hay-hay-bee-bee.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span></div></div>

<p>"And all those pink satin monkeys bumping their cocoanut shells together
in the green moonlight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, after the first act, what?" asked the Bibliomaniac.</p>

<p>"The usual intermission," said the Idiot. "You don't have to write that.
The audience generally knows what to do."</p>

<p>"But your second act?" asked the Poet.</p>

<p>"Oh, come off," said the Idiot rising. "We were to do this thing in
collaboration. So far I've done the whole blooming business. I'll leave
the second act to you. When you collaborate, Mr. Poet, you've got to do
a little collabbing on your own account. What did you think you were to
do&mdash;collect the royalties?"</p>

<p>"I'm told," said the Lawyer, "that that is sometimes the hardest thing
to do in a comic opera."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be self-sacrificing," said the Idiot, "and bear my full
share of it."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said the Bibliomaniac, "that that opera produced in
the right place might stand a chance of a run."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the Idiot. "After all, Mr. Bib, you are a man of some
penetration. How long a run?"</p>

<p>"One consecutive night," said the Bibliomaniac.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;and where?" demanded the Idiot with a smile.</p>

<p>"At Bloomingdale," answered the Bibliomaniac severely.</p>

<p>"That's a very good idea," said the Idiot. "When you go back there, Mr.
Bib, I wish you'd suggest it to the Superintendent."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span></p>

<h2>WAMSLEY'S AUTOMATIC PASTOR</h2>

<h3>BY FRANK CRANE</h3>


<p>"Yes, sir," said the short, chunky man, as he leaned back against the
gorgeous upholstery of his seat in the smoking compartment of the
sleeping-car; "yes, sir, I knew you was a preacher the minute I laid
eyes on you. You don't wear your collar buttoned behind, nor a black
thingumbob over your shirt front, nor Presbyterian whiskers, nor a
little gold cross on a black string watch chain; them's the usual marks,
I know, and you hain't got any of 'em. But I knew you just the same. You
can't fool J.P. Wamsley. You see, there's a peculiar air about a man
that's accustomed to handle any particular line of goods. You can tell
'em all, if you'll just notice,&mdash;any of 'em,&mdash;white-goods counter,
lawyer, doctor, travelin' man, politician, railroad,&mdash;every one of 'em's
got his sign out, and it don't take a Sherlock Holmes to read it,
neither. It's the same way with them gospel goods. You'll excuse me, but
when I saw you come in here and light a cigar, with an air of
I-will-now-give-you-a-correct-imitation-of-a-human-being, I says to
myself, 'There's one of my gospel friends.' Murder will out, as the
feller says.</p>

<p>"Experience, did you say? I must have had considerable experience? Well,
I guess yes! Didn't you never hear of my invention, Wamsley's Automatic
Pastor, Self-feedin' Preacher and Lightning Caller? Say, that was the
hottest scheme ever. I'll tell you about it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span></p>

<p>"You see, it's this way. I'm not a church member myself&mdash;believe in it,
you know, and all that sort of thing,&mdash;I'm for religion strong, and when
it comes to payin' I'm right there with the goods. My wife is a member,
and a good one; in fact, she's so blame good that we average up pretty
well.</p>

<p>"Well, one day they elected me to the board of trustees at the church;
because I was the heaviest payer, I suppose. I kicked some, not bein'
anxious to pose as a pious individual, owin' to certain brethren in the
town who had a little confidential information on J.P. and might be
inclined to get funny. But they insisted, allowin' that me bein' the
most prominent and successful merchant in the town, and similar rot, I
ought to line up and help out the cause, and so on; so finally I give
in.</p>

<p>"I went to two or three of their meetin's&mdash;and say, honest, they were
the fiercest things ever."</p>

<p>The minister smiled knowingly.</p>

<p>"You're on, I see. Ain't those official meetin's of a church the limit?
Gee! Once I went&mdash;a cold winter night&mdash;waded through snow knee-deep to a
giraffe&mdash;and sat there two hours, while they discussed whether they'd
fix the pastor's back fence or not&mdash;price six dollars! I didn't say
anything, bein' sort o' new, you know, but I made up my mind that next
time I'd turn loose on 'em, if it was the last thing I did.</p>

<p>"I says to my wife when I got home, 'Em,' says I, 'if gittin' religion
gives a man softenin' of the brain, like I see it workin' on them men
there to-night, I'm afraid I ain't on prayin' ground and intercedin'
terms, as the feller says. The men in that bunch to-night was worth over
eight hundred thousand dollars, and they took eleven dollars and a
half's worth o' my time chewin' the rag over fixin' the parson's fence.
I'm goin' to bed,' I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span> says, 'and if I shouldn't wake up in the mornin',
if you should miss petty in the mornin', you may know his vital powers
was exhausted by the hilarious proceedin's of this evenin'.'</p>

<p>"But I must get along to my story, about my automatic pastor. One day
the preacher resigned,&mdash;life probably hectored out of him by a lot o'
cheap skates whose notion of holdin' office in church consisted in
cuttin' down expenses and findin' fault with the preacher because he
didn't draw in sinners enough to fill the pews and pay their bills for
'em.</p>

<p>"When it come to selectin' a committee to get a new pastor, I butted
right in. I had an idea, so&mdash;me to the front, leadin' trumps and bangin'
my cards down hard on the table. Excuse my gay and festive reference to
playin'-cards, but what I mean is, that I thought the fullness of time
had arrived and was a-hollerin' for J.P. Wamsley.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, it was right then and there I invented my automatic pastor,
continuous revolving hand-shaker and circular jolly-hander.</p>

<p>"I brung it before the official brethren one night and explained its
modus operandi. I had a wax figger made by the same firm that supplies
me with the manikins for my show-windows. And it was a peach, if I do
say it myself. Tall, handsome figger, benevolent face, elegant smile
that won't come off, as the feller says, Chauncey Depew spinnage in
front of each ear. It was a sure lu-lu.</p>

<p>"'Now,' I says to 'em, 'gentlemen, speakin' o' pastors, I got one here I
want to recommend. It has one advantage anyhow; it won't cost you a
cent. I'll make you a present of it, and also chip in, as heretofore,
toward operatin' expenses.' That caught old Jake Hicks&mdash;worth a hundred
thousand dollars, and stingier 'n all git-out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span> He leaned over and
listened, same as if he was takin' 'em right off the bat. He's a retired
farmer. If you'll find me a closer boy than a retired farmer moved to
town, you can have the best plug hat in my store.</p>

<p>"'You observe,' I says, 'that he has the leadin' qualifications of all
and comes a heap cheaper than most. He is swivel mounted; that is, the
torso, so to speak, is pinioned onto the legs, so that the upper part of
the body can revolve. This enables him to rotate freely without bustin'
his pants, the vest bein' unconnected with the trousers.</p>

<p>"'Now, you stand this here, whom we will call John Henry, at the door of
the church as the congregation enters, havin' previously wound him up,
and there he stays, turning around and givin' the glad hand and cheery
smile, and so doth his unchangin' power display as the unwearied sun
from day to day, as the feller says. Nobody neglected, all pleased. You
remember the last pastor wasn't sociable enough, and there was
considerable complaint because he didn't hike right down after the
benediction and jolly the flock as they passed out. We'll have a wire
run the length of the meetin' house, with a gentle slant from the pulpit
to the front door, and as soon as meetin's over, up goes John Henry and
slides down to the front exit, and there he stands, gyratin' and handin'
out pleasant greeting to all,&mdash;merry Christmas and happy New Year to
beat the band.</p>

<p>"'Now as for preachin',' I continued, 'you see all you have to do is to
raise up the coat-tails and insert a record on the phonograph concealed
here in the back of the chest, with a speakin' tube runnin' up to the
mouth. John Henry bein' a regular minister, he can get the Homiletic
Review at a dollar and a half a year; we can subscribe for that, get the
up-to-datest sermons by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span> most distinguished divines, get some gent
that's afflicted with elocution to say 'em into a record, and on Sunday
our friend and pastor here will reel 'em off fine. You press the
button&mdash;he does the rest, as the feller says.'</p>

<p>"'How about callin' on the members?' inquires Andy Robinson.</p>

<p>"'Easy,' says I. 'Hire a buggy of Brother Jinks here, who keeps a livery
stable, at one dollar per <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Get a nigger to chauffeur the pastor at
fifty cents per same. There you are. Let the boy be provided with an
assortment of records to suit the people&mdash;pleasant and sad, consolatory
and gay, encouragin' or reprovin', and so forth. The coon drives up,
puts in a cartridge, sets the pastor in the door, and when the family
gets through with him they sets him out again.</p>

<p>"'There are, say about three hundred callin' days in the year. He can
easy make fifteen calls a day on an average&mdash;equals four thousand five
hundred calls a year, at $450. Of course, there's the records, but they
won't cost over $50 at the outside&mdash;you can shave 'em off and use 'em
over again, you know.'</p>

<p>"'But there's the personality of the pastor,' somebody speaks up. 'It's
that which attracts folks and fills the pews.'</p>

<p>"'Personality shucks!' says I. 'Haven't we had personality enough? For
every man it attracts it repels two. Your last preacher was one of the
best fellers that ever struck this town. He was a plum brick, and had
lots o' horse sense, to boot. He could preach, too, like a house afire.
But you kicked him out because he wasn't sociable enough. You're askin'
an impossibility. No man can be a student and get up the rattlin'
sermons he did, and put in his time trottin' around callin' on the
sisters.</p>

<p>"'Now, let's apply business sense to this problem.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span> That's the way I run
my store. Find out what the people want and give it to 'em, is my motto.
Now, people ain't comin' to church unless there's somethin' to draw 'em.
We've tried preachin', and it won't draw. They say they want
sociability, so let's give it to 'em strong. They want attention paid to
'em. You turn my friend here loose in the community, and he'll make each
and every man, woman and child think they're it in less'n a month. If
anybody gets disgruntled, you sic John Henry here on 'em, and you'll
have 'em come right back a-runnin', and payin' their pew rent in
advance.</p>

<p>"'Then,' I continued, 'that ain't all. There's another idea I propose,
to go along with the pastor, as a sort of side line. That's tradin'
stamps. Simple, ain't it? Wonder why you never thought of it yourselves,
don't you? That's the way with all bright ideas. People drink soda water
all their lives, and along comes a genius and hears the fizz, and goes
and invents a Westinghouse brake. Same as Newton and the apple, and
Columbus and the egg.</p>

<p>"'All you have to do is to give tradin' stamps for attendance, and your
church fills right up, and John Henry keeps 'em happy. Stamps can be
redeemed at any store. So many stamps gets, say a parlor lamp or a
masterpiece of Italian art in a gilt frame; so many more draws a steam
cooker or an oil stove; so many more and you have a bicycle or a hair
mattress or a what-not; and so on up to where a hat full of 'em gets an
automobile.</p>

<p>"'I tell you when a family has a what-not in their eye they ain't goin'
to let a little rain keep 'em home from church. If they're all really
too sick to go they'll hire a substitute. And I opine these here stamps
will have a powerful alleviatin' effect on Sunday-sickness.</p>

<p>"'And then,' I went on, waxin' eloquent, and leanin'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span> the pastor against
the wall, so I could put one hand in my coat and gesture with the other
and make it more impressive,&mdash;'and then,' I says, 'just think of them
other churches. We won't do a thing to 'em. That Baptist preacher thinks
he's a wizz because he makes six hundred calls a year. You just wait
till the nigger gets to haulin' John Henry here around town and loadin'
him up with rapid-fire conversations. That Baptist gent will look like
thirty cents, that's what he'll look like. He'll think he's Rojessvinsky
and the Japanese fleet's after him. And the Campbellites think they done
it when they got their new pastor, with a voice like a Bull o' Bashan
comin' down hill. Just wait till we load a few of them extra-sized
records with megaphone attachment into our pastor, and gear him up to
two hundred and fifty words a minute, and then where, oh, where is
Mister Campbellite, as the feller says.</p>

<p>"'Besides, brethren, this pastor, havin' no family, won't need his back
fence fixed; in fact, he won't need the parsonage; we can rent it, and
the proceeds will go toward operatin' expenses.</p>

<p>"'What we need to do,' I says in conclusion, 'is to get in line, get up
to date, give the people what they want. We have no way of judgin' the
future but by the past, as the feller says. We know they ain't no human
bein' can measure up to our requirements, so let's take a fall out of
science, and have enterprise and business sense.'"</p>

<p>J.P. Wamsley reached for a match.</p>

<p>"Did they accept your offer?" asked his companion. "I am anxious to know
how your plan worked. It has many points in its favor, I confess."</p>

<p>"No," replied J.P. Wamsley, as he meditatively puffed his cigar and
seemed to be lovingly reviewing the past. "No, they didn't. I'm kind o'
sorry, too. I'd like to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span> seen the thing tried myself. But," he
added, with a slow and solemn wink, "they passed a unanimous resolution
callin' back the old pastor at an increased salary."</p>

<p>"I should say, then, that your invention was a success."</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't lose out on it, anyhow. I've got John Henry rigged up
with a new bunch of whiskers, and posin' in my show-window as Dewitt,
signin' the peace treaty, in an elegant suit of all-wool at $11.50."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span></p>

<span class="i0">They used to smoke (!) and laugh out loud (!)<br /></span>

<h2>THE TOWER OF LONDON</h2>

<h3>BY ARTEMUS WARD</h3>


<p>Mr. Punch, <i>My Dear Sir</i>:&mdash;I skurcely need inform you that your
excellent Tower is very pop'lar with pe'ple from the agricultooral
districks, and it was chiefly them class which I found waitin at the
gates the other mornin.</p>

<p>I saw at once that the Tower was established on a firm basis. In the
entire history of firm basisis I don't find a basis more firmer than
this one.</p>

<p>"You have no Tower in America?" said a man in the crowd, who had somehow
detected my denomination.</p>

<p>"Alars! no," I anserd; "we boste of our enterprise and improovements,
and yit we are devoid of a Tower. America oh my onhappy country! thou
hast not got no Tower! It's a sweet Boon."</p>

<p>The gates was opened after a while, and we all purchist tickets, and
went into a waitin-room.</p>

<p>"My frens," said a pale-faced little man, in black close, "this is a sad
day."</p>

<p>"Inasmuch as to how?" I said.</p>

<p>"I mean it is sad to think that so many peple have been killed within
these gloomy walls. My frens, let us drop a tear!"</p>

<p>"No," I said, "you must excuse me. Others may drop one if they feel like
it; but as for me, I decline. The early managers of this institootion
were a bad lot, and their crimes were trooly orful; but I can't sob for
those who died four or five hundred years ago. If they was my own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
relations I couldn't. It's absurd to shed sobs over things which occurd
during the rain of Henry the Three. Let us be cheerful," I continnered.
"Look at the festiv Warders, in their red flannil jackets. They are
cheerful, and why should it not be thusly with us?"</p>

<p>A Warder now took us in charge, and showed us the Trater's Gate, the
armers, and things. The Trater's Gate is wide enuff to admit about
twenty traters abrest, I should jedge; but beyond this, I couldn't see
that it was superior to gates in gen'ral.</p>

<p>Traters, I will here remark, are a onfornit class of peple. If they
wasn't, they wouldn't be traters. They conspire to bust up a
country&mdash;they fail, and they're traters. They bust her, and they become
statesmen and heroes.</p>

<p>Take the case of Gloster, afterward Old Dick the Three, who may be seen
at the Tower on horseback, in a heavy tin overcoat&mdash;take Mr. Gloster's
case. Mr. G. was a conspirator of the basist dye, and if he'd failed, he
would have been hung on a sour apple tree. But Mr. G. succeeded, and
became great. He was slewed by Col. Richmond, but he lives in history,
and his equestrian figger may be seen daily for a sixpence, in
conjunction with other em'nent persons, and no extra charge for the
Warder's able and bootiful lectur.</p>

<p>There's one king in this room who is mounted onto a foaming steed, his
right hand graspin a barber's pole. I didn't learn his name.</p>

<p>The room where the daggers and pistils and other weppins is kept is
interestin. Among this collection of choice cuttlery I notist the bow
and arrer which those hot-heded old chaps used to conduct battles with.
It is quite like the bow and arrer used at this day by certain tribes of
American Injuns, and they shoot 'em off with such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span> excellent precision
that I almost sigh'd to be an Injun when I was in the Rocky Mountain
regin. They are a pleasant lot them Injuns. Mr. Cooper and Dr. Catlin
have told us of the red man's wonerful eloquence, and I found it so. Our
party was stopt on the plains of Utah by a band of Shoshones, whose
chief said:</p>

<p>"Brothers! the pale-face is welcome. Brothers! the sun is sinking in the
west, and Wa-na-bucky-she will soon cease speakin. Brothers! the poor
red man belongs to a race which is fast becomin extink."</p>

<p>He then whooped in a shrill manner, stole all our blankets and whisky,
and fled to the primeval forest to conceal his emotions.</p>

<p>I will remark here, while on the subjeck of Injuns, that they are in the
main a very shaky set, with even less sense than the Fenians, and when I
hear philanthropists be-wailin the fack that every year "carries the
noble red man nearer the settin sun," I simply have to say I'm glad of
it, tho' it is rough on the settin sun. They call you by the sweet name
of Brother one minit, and the next they scalp you with their
Thomas-hawks. But I wander. Let us return to the Tower.</p>

<p>At one end of the room where the weppins is kept, is a wax figger of
Queen Elizabeth, mounted on a fiery stuffed hoss, whose glass eye
flashes with pride, and whose red morocker nostril dilates hawtily, as
if conscious of the royal burden he bears. I have associated Elizabeth
with the Spanish Armady. She's mixed up with it at the Surrey Theater,
where <i>Troo to the Core</i> is bein acted, and in which a full bally core
is introjooced on board the Spanish Admiral's ship, giving the audiens
the idee that he intends openin a moosic-hall in Plymouth the moment he
conkers that town. But a very interesting drammer is <i>Troo to the Core</i>,
notwithstandin the eccen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>tric conduct of the Spanish Admiral; and very
nice it is in Queen Elizabeth to make Martin Truegold a baronet.</p>

<p>The Warder shows us some instrooments of tortur, such as thumbscrews,
throat-collars, etc., statin that these was conkered from the Spanish
Armady, and addin what a crooil peple the Spaniards was in them
days&mdash;which elissited from a bright-eyed little girl of about twelve
summers the remark that she tho't it <i>was</i> rich to talk about the
crooilty of the Spaniards usin thumbscrews, when he was in a Tower where
so many poor peple's heads had been cut off. This made the Warder
stammer and turn red.</p>

<p>I was so pleased with the little girl's brightness that I could have
kissed the dear child, and I would if she'd been six years older.</p>

<p>I think my companions intended makin a day of it, for they all had
sandwiches, sassiges, etc. The sad-lookin man, who had wanted us to drop
a tear afore we started to go round, fling'd such quantities of sassige
into his mouth that I expected to see him choke hisself to death; he
said to me, in the Beauchamp Tower, where the poor prisoners writ their
onhappy names on the cold walls, "This is a sad sight."</p>

<p>"It is indeed," I anserd. "You're black in the face. You shouldn't eat
sassige in public without some rehearsals beforehand. You manage it
orkwardly."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I mean this sad room."</p>

<p>Indeed, he was quite right. Tho' so long ago all these drefful things
happened, I was very glad to git away from this gloomy room, and go
where the rich and sparklin Crown Jewils is kept. I was so pleased with
the Queen's Crown, that it occurd to me what a agree'ble surprise it
would be to send a sim'lar one home to my wife; and I asked the Warder
what was the vally of a good, well-con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>structed Crown like that. He told
me, but on cypherin up with a pencil the amount of funs I have in the
Jint Stock Bank, I conclooded I'd send her a genteel silver watch
instid.</p>

<p>And so I left the Tower. It is a solid and commandin edifis, but I deny
that it is cheerful. I bid it adoo without a pang.</p>

<p>I was droven to my hotel by the most melancholly driver of a
four-wheeler that I ever saw. He heaved a deep sigh as I gave him two
shillings.</p>

<p>"I'll give you six d.'s more," I said, "if it hurts you so."</p>

<p>"It isn't that," he said, with a hart-rendin groan, "it's only a way I
have. My mind's upset to-day. I at one time tho't I'd drive you into the
Thames. I've been readin all the daily papers to try and understand
about Governor Eyre, and my mind is totterin. It's really wonderful I
didn't drive you into the Thames."</p>

<p>I asked the onhappy man what his number was, so I could redily find him
in case I should want him agin, and bad him good-by. And then I tho't
what a frollicsome day I'd made of it.</p>

<p>
Respectably, etc.<br />

<h3>SCIENCE AND NATURAL HISTORY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>, <i>My Dear Sir</i>:&mdash;I was a little disapinted at not receivin a
invitation to jine in the meetins of the Social Science Congress....</p>

<p>I prepared an Essy on Animals to read before the Social Science meetins.
It is a subjeck I may troothfully say I have successfully wrastled with.
I tackled it when only nineteen years old. At that tender age I writ a
Essy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span> for a lit'ry Institoot entitled, "Is Cats to be trusted?" Of the
merits of that Essy it doesn't becum me to speak, but I may be excoos'd
for mentionin that the Institoot parsed a resolution that "whether we
look upon the length of this Essy, or the manner in which it is written,
we feel that we will not express any opinion of it, and we hope it will
be read in other towns."</p>

<p>Of course the Essy I writ for the Social Science Society is a more
finisheder production than the one on Cats, which was wroten when my
mind was crood, and afore I had masterd a graceful and ellygant stile of
composition. I could not even punctooate my sentences proper at that
time, and I observe with pane, on lookin over this effort of my youth,
that its beauty is in one or two instances mar'd by ingrammaticisms.
This was inexcusable, and I'm surprised I did it. A writer who can't
write in a grammerly manner better shut up shop.</p>

<p>You shall hear this Essy on Animals. Some day when you have four hours
to spare, I'll read it to you. I think you'll enjoy it. Or, what will be
much better, if I may suggest&mdash;omit all picturs in next week's <i>Punch</i>,
and do not let your contributors write eny thing whatever (let them have
a holiday; they can go to the British Mooseum;) and publish my Essy
intire. It will fill all your collumes full, and create comment. Does
this proposition strike you? Is it a go?</p>

<p>In case I had read the Essy to the Social Sciencers, I had intended it
should be the closin attraction. I intended it should finish the
proceedins. I think it would have finished them. I understand animals
better than any other class of human creatures. I have a very animal
mind, and I've been identified with 'em doorin my entire perfessional
career as a showman, more especial bears, wolves, leopards and
serpunts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span></p>

<p>The leopard is as lively a animal as I ever came into contack with. It
is troo he cannot change his spots, but you can change 'em for him with
a paint-brush, as I once did in the case of a leopard who wasn't
nat'rally spotted in a attractive manner. In exhibitin him I used to
stir him up in his cage with a protracted pole, and for the purpuss of
makin him yell and kick up in a leopardy manner, I used to casionally
whack him over the head. This would make the children inside the booth
scream with fright, which would make fathers of families outside the
booth very anxious to come in&mdash;because there is a large class of parents
who have a uncontrollable passion for takin their children to places
where they will stand a chance of being frightened to death.</p>

<p>One day I whacked this leopard more than ushil, which elissited a
remonstrance from a tall gentleman in spectacles, who said, "My good
man, do not beat the poor caged animal. Rather fondle him."</p>

<p>"I'll fondle him with a club," I ansered, hitting him another whack.</p>

<p>"I prithy desist," said the gentleman; "stand aside, and see the effeck
of kindness. I understand the idiosyncracies of these creeturs better
than you do."</p>

<p>With that he went up to the cage, and thrustin his face in between the
iron bars, he said, soothingly, "Come hither, pretty creetur."</p>

<p>The pretty creetur come-hithered rayther speedy, and seized the
gentleman by the whiskers, which he tore off about enuff to stuff a
small cushion with.</p>

<p>He said, "You vagabone, I'll have you indicted for exhibitin dangerous
and immoral animals."</p>

<p>I replied, "Gentle Sir, there isn't a animal here that hasn't a
beautiful moral, but you mustn't fondle 'em. You mustn't meddle with
their idiotsyncracies."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span></p>

<p>The gentleman was a dramatic cricket, and he wrote a article for a
paper, in which he said my entertainment wos a decided failure.</p>

<p>As regards Bears, you can teach 'em to do interestin things, but they're
onreliable. I had a very large grizzly bear once, who would dance, and
larf, and lay down, and bow his head in grief, and give a mournful wale,
etsetry. But he often annoyed me. It will be remembered that on the
occasion of the first battle of Bull Run, it suddenly occurd to the
Fed'ral soldiers that they had business in Washington which ought not to
be neglected, and they all started for that beautiful and romantic city,
maintainin a rate of speed durin the entire distance that would have
done credit to the celebrated French steed <i>Gladiateur</i>. Very nat'rally
our Gov'ment was deeply grieved at this defeat; and I said to my Bear
shortly after, as I was givin a exhibition in Ohio&mdash;I said, "Brewin, are
you not sorry the National arms has sustained a defeat?" His business
was to wale dismal, and bow his head down, the band (a barrel origin and
a wiolin) playing slow and melancholy moosic. What did the grizzly old
cuss do, however, but commence darncin and larfin in the most joyous
manner? I had a narrer escape from being imprisoned for disloyalty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span></p>

<h2>DISLIKES</h2>

<h3>BY OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES</h3>


<p>I want it to be understood that I consider that a certain number of
persons are at liberty to dislike me peremptorily, without showing
cause, and that they give no offense whatever in so doing.</p>

<p>If I did not cheerfully acquiesce in this sentiment towards myself on
the part of others, I should not feel at liberty to indulge my own
aversions. I try to cultivate a Christian feeling to all my
fellow-creatures, but inasmuch as I must also respect truth and honesty,
I confess to myself a certain number of inalienable dislikes and
prejudices, some of which may possibly be shared by others. Some of
these are purely instinctive, for others I can assign a reason. Our
likes and dislikes play so important a part in the order of things that
it is well to see on what they are founded.</p>

<p>There are persons I meet occasionally who are too intelligent by half
for my liking. They know my thoughts beforehand, and tell me what I was
going to say. Of course they are masters of all my knowledge, and a good
deal besides; have read all the books I have read, and in later
editions; have had all the experiences I have been through, and more
too. In my private opinion every mother's son of them will lie at any
time rather than confess ignorance.</p>

<p>I have a kind of dread, rather than hatred, of persons with a large
excess of vitality; great feeders, great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span> laughers, great story-tellers,
who come sweeping over their company with a huge tidal wave of animal
spirits and boisterous merriment. I have pretty good spirits myself, and
enjoy a little mild pleasantry, but I am oppressed and extinguished by
these great lusty, noisy creatures, and feel as if I were a mute at a
funeral when they get into full blast.</p>

<p>I can not get along much better with those drooping, languid people,
whose vitality falls short as much as that of the others is in excess. I
have not life enough for two; I wish I had. It is not very enlivening to
meet a fellow-creature whose expression and accents say, "You are the
hair that breaks the camel's back of my endurance, you are the last drop
that makes my cup of woe run over;" persons whose heads drop on one side
like those of toothless infants, whose voices recall the tones in which
our old snuffling choir used to wail out the verses of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Life is the time to serve the Lord."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is another style which does not captivate me. I recognize an
attempt at the <i>grand manner</i> now and then, in persons who are well
enough in their way, but of no particular importance, socially or
otherwise. Some family tradition of wealth or distinction is apt to be
at the bottom of it, and it survives all the advantages that used to set
it off. I like family pride as well as my neighbors, and respect the
high-born fellow-citizen whose progenitors have not worked in their
shirt-sleeves for the last two generations full as much as I ought to.
But <i>grand-p&egrave;re oblige</i>; a person with a known grandfather is too
distinguished to find it necessary to put on airs. The few Royal Princes
I have happened to know were very easy people to get along with, and had
not half the social knee-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>action I have often seen in the collapsed
dowagers who lifted their eyebrows at me in my earlier years.</p>

<p>My heart does not warm as it should do towards the persons, not
intimates, who are always <i>too</i> glad to see me when we meet by accident,
and discover all at once that they have a vast deal to unbosom
themselves of to me.</p>

<p>There is one blameless person whom I can not love and have no excuse for
hating. It is the innocent fellow-creature, otherwise inoffensive to me,
whom I find I have involuntarily joined on turning a corner. I suppose
the Mississippi, which was flowing quietly along, minding its own
business, hates the Missouri for coming into it all at once with its
muddy stream. I suppose the Missouri in like manner hates the
Mississippi for diluting with its limpid, but insipid current the rich
reminiscences of the varied soils through which its own stream has
wandered. I will not compare myself to the clear or the turbid current,
but I will own that my heart sinks when I find all of a sudden I am in
for a corner confluence, and I cease loving my neighbor as myself until
I can get away from him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE TWO LADIES</h2>

<h3>BY CAROLYN WELLS</h3>


<p>Once on a Time there were Two Ladies at a Shop where Gorgeous and
Expensive Silks were temptingly displayed. "Only Six Dollars a Yard,
Madam," said the Shopman to One of the Ladies, as he held up the
Lustrous Breadths in those Tempting Fan-shaped Folds peculiar to
Shopmen.</p>

<p>The Lady hesitated, and looked Dubiously at the Silk, for she knew it
was Beyond her Means.</p>

<p>The Shopman Continued: "Very Cheap at the Price, and I have Only this
One Dress Pattern remaining. You will Take it? Yes? Certainly, I will
Send it at Once."</p>

<p>The Lady went away filled with Deep Regret because she had squandered
her Money so Foolishly, and wished she had been Firm in her Refusal to
buy the Goods.</p>

<p>The Other Lady saw a similar Silk. She felt it Between her Fingers,
Measured its Width with her Eye, and then said Impulsively, "Oh, That is
just What I Want. I will Take Twenty Yards."</p>

<p>No Sooner was the Silk cut off than the Lady felt Sharp Twinges of
Remorse, for she knew she must Pay for it with the Money she had Saved
Up for a new Dining-Room Carpet.</p>

<h2>AN ARKANSAS PLANTER</h2>

<h3>BY OPIE READ</h3>


<p>Slowly and heavily the Major walked out upon the veranda. He stood upon
the steps leading down into the yard, and he saw Louise afar off
standing upon the river's yellow edge. She had thrown her hat upon the
sand, and she stood with her hands clasped upon her brown head. A wind
blew down the stream, and the water lapped at her feet. The Major looked
back into the library, at the door wherein Pennington had stood, and
sighed with relief upon finding that he was gone. He looked back toward
the river. The girl was walking along the shore, meditatively swinging
her hat. He stepped to the corner of the house, and, gazing down the
road, saw Pennington on a horse, now sitting straight, now bending low
over the horn of the saddle. The old gentleman had a habit of making a
sideward motion with his hand as if he would put all unpleasant thoughts
behind him, and now he made the motion not only once, but many times.
And it seemed that his thoughts would not obey him, for he became more
imperative in his pantomimic demand.</p>

<p>At one corner of the large yard, where the smooth ground broke off into
a steep slope to the river, there stood a small office built of brick.
It was the Major's executive chamber, and thither he directed his steps.
Inside this place his laugh was never heard; at the door his smile
always faded. In this commercial sanctuary were enforced the exactions
that made the plantation thrive. Outside,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span> in the yard, in the "big
house," elsewhere under the sky, a plea of distress might moisten his
eyes and soften his heart to his own financial disadvantage, but under
the moss-grown shingles of the office all was business, hard,
uncompromising. It was told in the neighborhood that once, in this
inquisition of affairs, he demanded the last cent possessed by a widowed
woman, but that, while she was on her way home, he overtook her,
graciously returned the money and magnanimously tore to pieces a
mortgage that he held against her small estate.</p>

<p>Just as he entered the office there came across the yard a loud and
impatient voice. "Here, Bill, confound you, come and take this horse.
Don't you hear me, you idiot? You infernal niggers are getting to be so
no-account that the last one of you ought to be driven off the place.
Trot, confound you. Here, take this horse to the stable and feed him.
Where is the Major? In the office? The devil he is."</p>

<p>Toward the office slowly strode old Gideon Batts, fanning himself with
his white slouch hat. He was short, fat, and bald; he was bow-legged
with a comical squat; his eyes stuck out like the eyes of a swamp frog;
his nose was enormous, shapeless, and red. To the Major's family he
traced the dimmest line of kinship. During twenty years he had operated
a small plantation that belonged to the Major, and he was always at
least six years behind with his rent. He had married the widow Martin,
and afterward swore that he had been disgracefully deceived by her, that
he had expected much but had found her moneyless; and after this he had
but small faith in woman. His wife died and he went into contented
mourning, and out of gratitude to his satisfied melancholy, swore that
he would pay his rent, but failed. Upon the Major he held a strong hold,
and this was a puzzle to his neighbors. Their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span> characters stood at
fantastic and whimsical variance; one never in debt, the other never out
of debt; one clamped by honor, the other feeling not its restraining
pinch. But together they would ride abroad, laughing along the road. To
Mrs. Cranceford old Gid was a pest. With the shrewd digs of a woman, the
blood-letting side stabs of her sex, she had often shown her disapproval
of the strong favor in which the Major held him; she vowed that her
husband had gathered many an oath from Gid's swollen store of execration
(when, in truth, Gid had been an apt pupil under the Major), and she had
hoped that the Major's attachment to the church would of necessity free
him from the humiliating association with the old sinner, but it did
not, for they continued to ride abroad, laughing along the road.</p>

<p>Like a skittish horse old Gid shied at the office door. Once he had
crossed that threshold and it had cost him a crop of cotton.</p>

<p>"How are you, John?" was Gid's salutation as he edged off, still fanning
himself.</p>

<p>"How are you, sir?" was the Major's stiff recognition of the fact that
Gid was on earth.</p>

<p>"Getting hotter, I believe, John."</p>

<p>"I presume it is, sir." The Major sat with his elbow resting on a desk,
and about him were stacked threatening bundles of papers; and old Gid
knew that in those commercial romances he himself was a familiar
character.</p>

<p>"Are you busy, John?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but you may come in."</p>

<p>"No, I thank you. Don't believe I've got time."</p>

<p>"Then take time. I want to talk to you. Come in."</p>

<p>"No, not to-day, John. Fact is I'm not feeling very well. Head's all
stopped up with a cold, and these sum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>mer colds are awful, I tell you.
It was a summer cold that took my father off."</p>

<p>"How's your cotton in that low strip along the bayou?"</p>

<p>"Tolerable, John; tolerable."</p>

<p>"Come in. I want to talk to you about it."</p>

<p>"Don't believe I can stand the air in there, John. Head all stopped up.
Don't believe I'm going to live very long."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. You are as strong as a buck."</p>

<p>"You may think so, John, but I'm not. I thought father was strong, too,
but a summer cold got him. I am getting along in years, John, and I find
that I have to take care of myself. But if you really want to talk to me
about that piece of cotton, come out where it's cool."</p>

<p>The Major shoved back his papers and arose, but hesitated; and Gid stood
looking on, fanning himself. The Major stepped out and Gid's face was
split asunder with a broad smile.</p>

<p>"I gad. I've been up town and had a set-to with old Baucum and the rest
of them. Pulled up fifty winner at poker and jumped. Devilish glad to
see you; miss you every minute of the time I'm away. Let's go over here
and sit down on that bench."</p>

<p>They walked toward a bench under a live-oak tree, and upon Gid's
shoulder the Major's hand affectionately rested. They halted to laugh,
and old Gid shoved the Major away from him, then seized him and drew him
back. They sat down, still laughing, but suddenly the Major became
serious.</p>

<p>"Gid, I'm in trouble," he said.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, my boy, there is no such thing as trouble. Throw it off. Look
at me. I've had enough of what the world calls trouble to kill a dozen
ordinary men, but just look at me&mdash;getting stronger every day. Throw it
off. What is it anyway?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span></p>

<p>"Louise declares that she is going to marry Pennington."</p>

<p>"What!" old Gid exclaimed, turning with a bouncing flounce and looking
straight at the Major. "Marry Pennington! Why, she shan't, John. That's
all there is of it. We object and that settles it. Why, what the deuce
can she be thinking about?"</p>

<p>"Thinking about him," the Major answered.</p>

<p>"Yes, but she must quit it. Why, it's outrageous for as sensible a girl
as she is to think of marrying that fellow. You leave it to me; hear
what I said? Leave it to me."</p>

<p>This suggested shift of responsibility did not remove the shadow of
sadness that had fallen across the Major's countenance.</p>

<p>"You leave it to me and I'll give her a talk she'll not forget. I'll
make her understand that she's a queen, and a woman is pretty devilish
skittish about marrying anybody when you convince her that she's a
queen. What does your wife say about it?"</p>

<p>"She hasn't said anything. She's out visiting and I haven't seen her
since Louise told me of her determination to marry him."</p>

<p>"Don't say determination, John. Say foolish notion. But it's all right."</p>

<p>"No, it's not all right."</p>

<p>"What, have you failed to trust me? Is it possible that you have lost
faith in me? Don't do that, John, for if you do it will be a never
failing source of regret. You don't seem to remember what my powers of
persuasion have accomplished in the past. When I was in the legislature,
chairman of the Committee on County and County Lines, what did my
protest do? It kept them from cutting off a ten-foot strip of this
county and adding it to Jefferson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span> You must remember those things,
John, for in the factors of persuasion lie the shaping of human life.
I've been riding in the hot sun and I think that a mint julep would hit
me now just about where I live. Say, there, Bill, bring us some mint,
sugar and whisky. And cold water, mind you."</p>

<p>"Ah," said old Gideon, sipping his scented drink, "virtue may become
wearisome, and we may gape during the most fervent prayer, but I gad,
John, there is always the freshness of youth in a mint julep. Pour just
a few more drops of liquor into mine, if you please&mdash;want it to rassle
me a trifle, you know. Recollect those come-all ye songs we used to
sing, going down the river? Remember the time I snatched the sword out
of my cane and lunged at a horse trader from Tennessee? Scoundrel
grabbed it and broke it off and it was all I could do to keep him from
establishing a close and intimate relationship with me. Great old days,
John; and I gad, they'll never come again."</p>

<p>"I remember it all, Gid, and it was along there that you fell in love
with a woman that lived at Mortimer's Bend."</p>

<p>"Easy, now, John. A trifle more liquor, if you please. Thank you. Yes, I
used to call her the wild plum. Sweet thing, and I had no idea that she
was married until her lout of a husband came down to the landing with a
double-barrel gun. Ah, Lord, if she had been single and worth money I
could have made her very happy. Fate hasn't always been my friend,
John."</p>

<p>"Possibly not, Gid, but you know that fate to be just should divide her
favors, and this time she leaned toward the woman."</p>

<p>"Slow, John. I gad, there's your wife."</p>

<p>A carriage drew up at the yard gate and a woman stepped out. She did not
go into the house, but seeing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span> the Major, came toward him. She was tall,
with large black eyes and very gray hair. In her step was suggested the
pride of an old Kentucky family, belles, judges and generals. She smiled
at the Major and bowed stiffly at old Gid. The two men arose.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I don't care to sit down," she said. "Where is Louise?"</p>

<p>"I saw her down by the river just now," the Major answered.</p>

<p>"I wish to see her at once," said his wife.</p>

<p>"Shall I go and call her, madam?" Gid asked.</p>

<p>She gave him a look of surprise and answered: "No, I thank you."</p>

<p>"No trouble, I assure you," Gid persisted. "I am pleased to say that age
has not affected my voice, except to mellow it with more of reverence
when I address the wife of a noble man and the mother of a charming
girl."</p>

<p>She had dignity, but humor was never lost upon her, and she smiled. This
was encouraging, and old Gid proceeded: "I was just telling the Major of
my splendid prospects for a bountiful crop this year, and I feel that
with this blessing of Providence I shall soon be able to meet all my
obligations. I saw our rector, Mr. Mills, this morning, and he spoke of
how thankful I ought to be&mdash;he had just passed my bayou field&mdash;and I
told him that I would not only assert my gratitude, but would prove it
with a substantial donation to the church at the end of the season."</p>

<p>In the glance which she gave him there was refined and gentle contempt;
and then she looked down upon the decanter of whisky. Old Gideon drew
down the corners of his mouth, as was his wont when he strove to excite
compassion.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said with a note of pity forced upon his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span> voice, "I am
exceedingly thankful for all the blessings that have come to me, but I
haven't been very well of late; rather feeble to-day, and the kind Major
noticing it, insisted upon my taking a little liquor, the medicine of
our sturdy and gallant fathers, madam."</p>

<p>The Major sprawled himself back with a roaring laugh, and hereupon Gid
added: "It takes the Major a long time to get over a joke. Told him one
just now and it tickled him mighty nigh to death. Well, I must be going
now, and, madam, if I should chance to see anything of your charming
daughter, I will tell her that you desire a conference with her.
William," he called, "my horse, if you please."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Major's wife went into the house as Batts came up, glancing back at
him as she passed through the door; and in her eyes there was nothing as
soft as a tear. The old fellow winced, as he nearly always did when she
gave him a direct look.</p>

<p>"Are you all well?" Gideon asked, lifting the tails of his long coat and
seating himself in a rocking chair.</p>

<p>"First-rate," the Major answered, drawing forward another rocker; and
when he had sat down, he added: "Somewhat of an essence of November in
the air."</p>

<p>"Yes," Gid assented; "felt it in my joints before I got up this
morning." From his pocket he took a plug of tobacco.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd given up chewing," said the Major. "Last time I saw you
I understood you to say that you had thrown your tobacco away."</p>

<p>"I did, John; but, I gad, I watched pretty close where I threw it.
Fellow over here gave me some stuff that he said would cure me of the
appetite, and I took it until I was afraid it would, and then threw it
away. I find that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span> when a man quits tobacco he hasn't anything to look
forward to. I quit for three days once, and on the third day, about the
time I got up from the dinner table, I asked myself: 'Well, now, got
anything to come next?' And all I could see before me was hours of
hankering; and, I gad, I slapped a negro boy on a horse and told him to
gallop over to the store and fetch me a hunk of tobacco. And after I
broke my resolution I thought I'd have a fit there in the yard waiting
for that boy to come back. I don't believe that it's right for a man to
kill any appetite that the Lord has given him. Of course, I don't
believe in the abuse of a good thing, but it's better to abuse it a
little sometimes than not to have it at all. If virtue consists in
deadening the nervous system to all pleasurable influences, why, you may
just mark my name off the list. There was old man Haskill. I sat up with
him the night after he died, and one of the men with me was harping upon
the great life the old fellow had lived&mdash;never chewed, never smoked,
never was drunk, never gambled, never did anything except to stand still
and be virtuous&mdash;and I couldn't help but feel that he had lost nothing
by dying."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE TWO YOUNG MEN</h2>

<h3>BY CAROLYN WELLS</h3>


<p>Once on a Time there were Two Young Men of Promising Capabilities.</p>

<p>One pursued no Especial Branch of Education, but Contented himself with
a Smattering of many different Arts and Sciences, exhibiting a Moderate
Proficiency in Each. When he Came to Make a Choice of some means of
Earning a Livelihood, he found he was Unsuccessful, for he had no
Specialty, and Every Employer seemed to Require an Expert in his Line.</p>

<p>The Other, from his Earliest Youth, bent all his Energies toward
Learning to play the Piano. He studied at Home and Abroad with Greatest
Masters, and he Achieved Wonderful Success. But as he was about to Begin
his Triumphant and Profitable Career, he had the Misfortune to lose both
Thumbs in a Railway Accident.</p>

<p>Thus he was Deprived of his Intended Means of Earning a Living, and as
he had no other Accomplishment he was Forced to Subsist on Charity.</p>

<p>Once on a Time there were Two Housewives who must Needs go to Market to
purchase the Day's Supplies.</p>

<p>One of Them, who was of a Dilatory Nature, said:</p>

<p>"I will not Hurry Myself, for I Doubt Not the Market contains Plenty for
all who come."</p>

<p>She therefore Sauntered Forth at her Leisure, and on reaching the Market
she found to her Dismay that the Choicest Cuts and the Finest Produce
had All been Sold, and there remained for her only the Inferior Meats
and Some Withered Vegetables.</p>

<p>The Other, who was One of the Hustling, Wide-awake Sort, said:</p>

<p>"I will Bestir myself Betimes and Hasten to Market that I may Take my
Pick ere my Neighbors appear on the Scene."</p>

<p>She did so, and when she Reached the Market she Discovered that the
Fresh Produce had not yet Arrived, and she must Content herself with the
Remnants of Yesterday's Stock.</p>

<h2>THE DYING GAG</h2>

<h3>BY JAMES L. FORD</h3>


<p>There was an affecting scene on the stage of a New York theater the
other night&mdash;a scene invisible to the audience and not down on the
bills, but one far more touching and pathetic than anything enacted
before the footlights that night, although it was a minstrel company
that gave the entertainment.</p>

<p>It was a wild, blustering night, and the wind howled mournfully around
the street corners, blinding the pedestrians with the clouds of dust
that it caught up from the gutters and hurled into their faces.</p>

<p>Old man Sweeny, the stage doorkeeper, dozing in his little glazed box,
was awakened by a sudden gust that banged the stage door and then went
howling along the corridor, almost extinguishing the gas-jets and making
the minstrels shiver in their dressing-rooms.</p>

<p>"What! You here to-night!" exclaimed old man Sweeny, as a frail figure,
muffled up in a huge ulster, staggered through the doorway and stood
leaning against the wall, trying to catch his breath.</p>

<p>"Yes; I felt that I couldn't stay away from the footlights to-night.
They tell me I'm old and worn out and had better take a rest, but I'll
go on till I drop," and with a hollow cough the Old Gag plodded slowly
down the dim and drafty corridor and sank wearily on a sofa in the big
dressing-room, where the other Gags and Conundrums were awaiting their
cues.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor old fellow!" said one of them, sadly. "He can't hold out much
longer."</p>

<p>"He ought not to go on except at matinees," replied another veteran, who
was standing in front of the mirror trimming his long, silvery beard,
and just then an attendant came in with several basins of gruel, and the
old Jests tucked napkins under their chins and sat down to partake of a
little nourishment before going on.</p>

<p>The bell tinkled and the entertainment began. One after another the
Jokes and Conundrums heard their cues, went on, and returned to the
dressing-room, for they all had to go on again in the after-piece. The
house was crowded to the dome, and there was scarcely a dry eye in the
vast audience as one after another of the old Quips and Jests that had
been treasured household words in many a family came on and then
disappeared to make room for others of their kind.</p>

<p>As the evening wore on the whisper ran through the theater that the Old
Gag was going on that night&mdash;perhaps for the last time; and many an eye
grew dim, many a pulse beat quicker at the thought of listening once
more to that hoary Jest, about whose head were clustered so many sacred
memories.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Old Gag was sitting in his corner of the dressing-room,
his head bowed on his breast, his gruel untasted on the tray before him.
The other Gags came and went, but he heeded them not. His thoughts were
far away. He was dreaming of old days, of his early struggles for fame,
and of his friends and companions of years ago. "Where are they now?" he
asked himself, sadly. "Some are wanderers on the face of the earth, in
comic operas. Two of them found ignoble graves in the 'Tourists''
company. Others are sleeping beneath the daisies in Harper's 'Editor's
Drawer.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're called, sir!"</p>

<p>The Old Gag awoke from his reverie, started to his feet, and, throwing
aside his heavy ulster, staggered to the entrance and stood there
patiently waiting for his cue.</p>

<p>"You're hardly strong enough to go on to-night," said a Merry Jest,
touching him kindly on the arm; but the gray-bearded one shook him off,
saying hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Let be! Let be! I must read those old lines once more&mdash;it may be for
the last time."</p>

<p>And now a solemn hush fell upon the vast audience as a sad-faced
minstrel uttered in tear-compelling accents the most pathetic words in
all the literature of minstrelsy:</p>

<p>"And so you say, Mr. Johnson, that all the people on the ship were
perishing of hunger, and yet you were eating fried eggs. How do you
account for that?"</p>

<p>For one moment a deathlike silence prevailed. Then the Old Gag stepped
forward and in clear, ringing tones replied:</p>

<p>"The ship lay to, and I got one."</p>

<p>A wild, heartrending sob came from the audience and relieved the tension
as the Old Gag staggered back into the entrance and fell into the
friendly arms that were waiting to receive him.</p>

<p>Sobbing Conundrums bore him to a couch in the dressing-room. Weeping
Jokes strove in vain to bring back the spark of life to his inanimate
form. But all to no avail.</p>

<p>The Old Gag was dead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="SOUTHERN_SKETCHES" id="SOUTHERN_SKETCHES"></a>SOUTHERN SKETCHES</h2>

<h3>BY BILL ARP</h3>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jim Allcorn</span></h3>

<p>I was only thinkin' how much better it is to be in a lively humor than
be goin' about like a disappointed offis seeker. Good humor is a blessed
thing in a family and smooths down a heap of trubble. I never was mad
but a few times in my life, and then I wasn't mad long. Foaks thought I
was mad when I fout Jim Allcorn, but I wasent. I never had had any
grudge agin Jim. He had never done me any harm, but I could hear of his
sayin' around in the naborhood that Bill Arp had played cock of the walk
long enuf. So one day I went over to Chulio court ground to joak with
the boys, and shore enuf Jim was there, and I soon perseeved that the
devil was in him. He had never been whipped by anybody in the distrikt,
and he outweighed me by about fifteen pounds. A drink or two had made
him sassy, and so he commenced walkin' around first to one crowd, and
then to another, darin' anybody to fite him. He would pint to his
forrerd and say, "I'll give anybody five dollars to hit that." I was
standin' tawkin' to Frank Air and John Johnsin, and as nobody took up
Jim's offer, thinks says I to myself, if he cums round here a huntin'
for a fite he shall have one, by golly. If he dares me to hit him I'll
do it if it's the last lick I ever strike on this side of Jordin. Frank
Air looked at me, and seemed to know what I was a thinkin', and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span> says
he, "Bill, jest let Allcorn alone. He's too big for you, and besides,
there ain't nothin' to fite about." By this time Jim was makin' rite
towards us. I put myself in position, and by the time he got to us every
muscle in my body was strung as tite as a banjo. I was worked up
powerful, and felt like I could whip a campmeetin' of wild cats. Shore
enuf Jim stepped up defiantly, and lookin' me rite in the eye, says he,
"I dare anybody to hit that," and he touched his knuckles to his
forrerd. He had barely straightened before I took him rite in the left
eye with a sock-dolyger that popped like a wagin' whip. It turned him
half round, and as quick as lightnin' I let him hav another on the right
temple, and followed it up with a leap that sprawled him as flat as a
foot mat. I knowed my customer, and I never giv him time to rally. If
ever a man was diligent in business it was me. I took him so hard and so
fast in the eyes with my fists, and in his bred basket with my knees,
that he didn't hav a chance to see or to breathe, and he was the worst
whipped man in two minets I ever seed in my life. When he hollered I
helped him up and breshed the dirt off his clothes, and he was as umble
as a ded nigger and as sober as a Presbyterian preacher. We took a dram
on the strength of it, and was always good frends afterwards.</p>

<p>But I dident start to tell you about that.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jim Perkins (Cousin of Eli)</span></h3>

<p>I jist wanted to say that I wasent mad with Jim Allcorn, as sum peepul
supposed; but it do illustrate the onsertainty of human kalkulashuns in
this subloonery world. The disappintments of life are amazin', and if a
man wants to fret and grumble at his luck he can find a reesunable
oppertunity to do so every day that he lives. Them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span> sort of
constitutional grumblers ain't much cumpany to me. I'd rather be Jim
Perkins with a bullit hole through me and take my chances. Jim, you
know, was shot down at Gains' Mill, and the ball went in at the
umbilikus, as Dr. Battey called it, and cum out at the backbone. The
Doktor sounded him, and sez he, "Jeems, my friend, your wound is
mortal." Jim looked at the Doktor, and then at me, and sez he, "That's
bad, ain't it?" "Mighty bad," sez I, and I was as sorry for him as I
ever was for anybody in my life. Sez he, "Bill, I'd make a will if it
warn't for one thing." "What's that, Jim?" sez I. He sorter smiled and
sez, "I hain't got nothin' to will." He then raised up on his elbow, and
sez he, "Doktor, is there one chance in a hundred for me?" and the
Doktor sez, "Jest about, Jim." "Well, then," sez he, "I'll git well&mdash;I
feel it in my gizzard." He looked down at the big hole in his umbilikus,
and sez he, "If I do get well, won't it be a great <i>naval</i> viktry,
Doktor Battey?" Well, shore enuff he did git well, and in two months he
was fitin' the Yanks away up in Maryland.</p>

<p>But I didn't start to tell you about that.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ike Mackoy</span></h3>

<p>I jest stuck it in by way of illustratin' the good effeks of keepin' up
one's spirits. My motto has always been to never say die, as Gen. Nelson
sed at the battle of Madagascar, or sum other big river. All things
considered, I've had a power of good luck in my life. I don't mean money
luck, by no means, for most of my life I've been so ded poor that
Lazarus would hev been considered a note shaver compared with me. But
I've been in a heap of close places, and sumhow always cum out rite side
up with keer. Speakin' of luck, I don't know that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span> I ever told you about
that rassel I had with Ike McKoy at Bob Hide's barbyku. You see Ike was
perhaps the best rasler in all Cherokee, and he jest hankered after a
chance to break a bone or two in my body. Now, you know, I never hunted
for a fite nor a fuss in my life, but I never dodged one. I dident want
a tilt with Ike, for my opinyun was that he was the best man of the two,
but I never sed anything and jest trusted to luck. We was both at the
barbyku, and he put on a heap of airs, and strutted around with his
shirt collar open clean down to his waist, and his hat cocked on one
side as sassy as a confedrit quartermaster. He took a dram or two and
stuffed himself full of fresh meat at dinner time. Purty soon it was
norated around that Ike was going to banter me for a rassel, and, shore
enuff, he did. The boys were all up for some fun, and Ike hollered out,
"I'll bet ten dollars I can paster the length of any man on the ground,
and I'll giv Bill Arp five dollars to take up the bet." Of course there
was no gittin' around the like of that. The banter got my blood up, and
so, without waitin' for preliminaries, I shucked myself and went in. The
boys was all powerfully excited, and was a bettin' evry dollar they
could raise; and Bob Moore, the feller I had licked about a year before,
jumped on a stump and sed hed bet twenty dollars to ten that Ike would
knock the breath out of me the first fall. I jest walked over to him
with the money and sed, "I'll take that bet." The river was right close
to the ring, and the bank was purty steep. I had on a pair of old
breeches that had been sained in and dried so often they was about half
rotten. When we hitched, Ike took good britches hold, and lifted me up
and down a few times like I was a child. He was the heaviest, but I had
the most spring in me, and so I jest let him play round for sum time,
limber like, until he suddenly took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span> a notion to make short work of it
by one of his backleg movements. He drawed me up to his body and lifted
me in the air with a powerful twist. Just at that minit his back was
close to the river bank, and as my feet touched the ground I giv a
tremenjius jerk backwards, and a shuv forwards, and my britches busted
plum open on the back, and tore clean off in front, and he fell from me
and tumbled into the water, kerchug, and went out of sight as clean as a
mud turtle in a mill pond. Such hollerin' as them boys done I rekon
never heard in them woods. I jumped in and helped Ike get out as he riz
to the top. He had took in a quart or two of water on top of his
barbyku, and he set on the bank and throwed up enuf vittels to feed a
pack of houns for a week. When he got over it he laffd, and sed Sally
told him before he left home he'd better let Bill Arp alone&mdash;for nobody
could run agin his luck. Ike always believed he would hav throwd me if
britches holt hadent broke, and I rekon may be he would. One thing is
sertin, it cured him of braggin', and that helps anybody. I never did
like a braggin' man. As a genrul thing they ain't much akkount, and
remind me of a dog I used to have, named Cesar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dogs</span></h3>

<p>But I dident start to tell you a dog story&mdash;only now, since I've
mentioned him, I must tell you a circumstance about Cees. He was a
middlin' size broot, with fox ears and yaller spots over his eyes, and
could out bark and out brag all creation when he was inside the yard. If
another dog was goin' along he'd run up and down the palins and bark and
take on like he'd give the world if that fence wasent there. So one day
when he was showin' off in that way I caught him by the nap of the neck
as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span> run by me, and jest histed him right over and drapped him. He
struck the ground like an injun rubber ball, and was back agin on my
side in a jiffy. If he had ever jumped that fence before I dident know
it. The other dog run a quarter of a mile without stoppin'. Now, that's
the way with sum foaks. If you want to hear war tawk jest put a fence
between 'em; and if you want it stopped, jest take the fence away. Dogs
is mighty like peepul anyhow. They've got karacter. Sum of em are good,
honest, trusty dogs that bark mity little and bite at the right time.
Sum are good pluk, and will fite like the dickens when their masters is
close by to back em, but ain't worth a cent by themselves. Sum make it a
bizness to make other dogs fite. You've seen these little fices a
runnin' around growlin' and snappin' when two big dogs cum together.
They are jest as keen to get up a row and see a big dog fite as a store
clerk or a shoemaker, and seem to enjoy it as much. And then, there's
them mean yaller-eyed bull terriers that don't care who they bite, so
they bite sumbody. They are no respekter of persons, and I never had
much respekt for a man who kept one on his premises. But of all mean,
triflin', contemptible dogs in the world, the meanest of all is a
country nigger's houn&mdash;one that will kill sheep, and suck eggs, and lick
the skillet, and steal everything he can find, and try to do as nigh
like his master as possibul. Sum dogs are filosofers, and study other
dogs' natur, just like foaks study foaks. It's amazin' to see a town dog
trot up to a country dog and interview him. How quick he finds out
whether it will do to attack him or not. If the country dog shows fite
jest notis the consequential dignity with which the town dog retires. He
goes off like there was a sudden emergency of bisness a callin' him
away. Town dogs sumtimes combine agin a country dog, jest like town<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>
boys try to run over country boys. I wish you could see Dr. Miller's dog
Cartoosh. He jest lays in the piazzer all day watchin' out for a stray
dog, and as soon as he sees him he goes for him, and he can tell in half
a minit whether he can whip him or run him; and if he can, he does it
instanter, and if he can't he runs to the next yard, where there's two
more dogs that nabor with him, and in a minit they all cum a tarin' out
together, and that country dog has to run or take a whippin', shore.
I've seen Cartoosh play that game many a time. These town pups remind me
powerfully of small editurs prowlin' around for news. In my opinyun they
is the inventors of the interview bisness.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Interviewers</span></h3>

<p>If it ain't a doggish sort of bisnes I'm mistaken in my idees of the
proprietes of life. When a man gits into trubble, these sub editurs go
fur him right strait, and they force their curosity away down into his
heart strings, and bore into his buzzom with an augur as hard and as
cold as chilld iron. Then away they go to skatter his feelins and
sekrets to the wide, wide world. You see the poor feller can't help
himself, for if he won't talk they'll go off and slander him, and make
the publik beleeve he's dun sumthing mean, and is ashamed to own it.
I've knowd em to go into a dungeon and interview a man who dident have
two hours to live. Dot rot em. I wish one of em would try to interview
me. If he didn't catch leather under his coat tail it would be bekaus he
retired prematurely&mdash;that's all. But I like editurs sorter&mdash;especially
sum. I like them that is the guardeens of sleepin' liberty, and good
morals, and publik welfare, and sich like; but there's sum kinds I don't
like. Them what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span> makes sensation a bizness; feedin' the peepul on
skandal, and crime, and gossip, and private quarrels, and them what
levies black mail on polytiks, and won't go for a man who won't pay em,
and will go for a man that will. Them last watch for elekshun times jest
like a sick frog waitin' for rain.</p>

<p>As Bill Nations used to say, I'd drather be a luniak and gnaw chains in
an asylum, than to be an editur that everybody feard and nobody
respekted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span></p>

<p>Once on a Time two Business Men were Each Confronted with what seemed to
be a Fine Chance to Make Money.</p>

<p>One Man, being of a Cautious and Prudent Nature, said: "I will not Take
Hold of this Matter until I have Carefully Examined it in All its
Aspects and Inquired into All its Details."</p>

<p>While he was thus Occupied in a thorough Investigation he Lost his
Chance of becoming a Partner in the Project, and as It proved to be a
Booming Success, he was Much Chagrined.</p>

<p>The Other Man, when he saw a Golden Opportunity Looming Up Before him,
Embraced it at once, without a Preliminary Question or Doubt.</p>

<p>But alas! after he had Invested all his Fortune in it, the Scheme proved

<h4><i>A Book about Indians, Animals, and the Woods</i></h4>

<h2>Kuloskap, the Master</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="smcap">And Other Algonkin Legends and Poems</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">By Charles Godfrey Leland, F.R.S.L., <i>and</i> John Dyneley Prince, Ph.D.</p>


<p>In the first four cantos are told the legends of the Indian god,
Kuloskap, narrating how he created the Indians' world, cared for the
interests of his children, dealt with the animal kingdom, and punished
the sorcerers. Following these cantos will be found the witchcraft lore,
lyrics, and miscellany. The stories take the reader into the heart of
nature. In the innermost recesses of the forest he follows the strange
doings of wizards, goblins, and witches, and revels in such exquisite
lyrics as those that tell of "The Scarlet Tanager and the Leaf," "The
Story of Nipon the Summer," "Lox, the Indian Devil," "The Song of the
Stars," and others.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Dan Beard</i> says: "It is the American Indian's 'King Arthur's Round
Table,' 'Robin Hood,' and 'The Arabian Nights.'"</p>

<p><i>Ernest Thompson-Seton</i> says: "... Priceless, unique,
irreplaceable."</p>

<p><i>San Francisco Bulletin</i>: "It is a valuable contribution to the
folk-lore of the world, and of intense interest."</p>

<p><i>The Independent</i>: "... Dainty in its woodsy freshness ... has the
same beauty as the Norse myths."</p></div>

<p><i>12mo, Cloth, 359 pp., Ornamental Cover, Profusely Illustrated with

<h4><i>A Charming Book</i></h4>

<h2>My Musical Memories</h2>

<h3>By REV. H.R. HAWEIS, A.M.,</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Author of "American Humorists," Etc., Etc.</i></p>


<p>A volume of personal reminiscences, dealing with early Life and
Recollections, Hearing Music, Old Violins, Paganini, Liszt, Wagner,
"Parsifal," and other kindred subjects, in a manner both artistic and
pleasing, which shows the author to be a person of great critical
ability in the realm of music. He is an enthusiast, for music hath
charms, so hath its memories; but his enthusiasm never carries him
beyond the bounds of good sense and fair judgment.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Of all Mr. Haweis' contributions to musical literature none is
richer or more readable than 'My Musical Memories'; in short, it is
a treasury of musical intelligence such as only a critical taste
and an almost infallible instinct could have gathered."&mdash;<i>The
Musical Herald, Boston.</i></p>

<p>"Those who know the charm and clearness of Mr. Haweis' style in
descriptive musical essays will need no commendation of these
'Memories,' which are not only vivid but critical."&mdash;<i>The Public
Ledger, Phila.</i></p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
