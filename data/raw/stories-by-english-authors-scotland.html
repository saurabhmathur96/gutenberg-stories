    <h2>
      THE COURTING OF T&rsquo;NOWHEAD&rsquo;S BELL, By J. M. Barrie
    </h2>
    <p>
      For two years it had been notorious in the square that Sam&rsquo;l Dickie was
      thinking of courting T&rsquo;nowhead&rsquo;s Bell, and that if Little Sanders
      Elshioner (which is the Thrums pronunciation of Alexander Alexander) went
      in for her, he might prove a formidable rival. Sam&rsquo;l was a weaver in the
      tenements, and Sanders a coal-carter, whose trade-mark was a bell on his
      horse&rsquo;s neck that told when coal was coming. Being something of a public
      man, Sanders had not, perhaps, so high a social position as Sam&rsquo;l, but he
      had succeeded his father on the coal-cart, while the weaver had already
      tried several trades. It had always been against Sam&rsquo;l, too, that once
      when the kirk was vacant he had advised the selection of the third
      minister who preached for it on the ground that it became expensive to pay
      a large number of candidates. The scandal of the thing was hushed up, out
      of respect for his father, who was a God-fearing man, but Sam&rsquo;l was known
      by it in Lang Tammas&rsquo;s circle. The coal-carter was called Little Sanders
      to distinguish him from his father, who was not much more than half his
      size. He had grown up with the name, and its inapplicability now came home
      to nobody. Sam&rsquo;l&rsquo;s mother had been more far-seeing than Sanders&rsquo;s. Her man
      had been called Sammy all his life because it was the name he got as a
      boy, so when their eldest son was born she spoke of him as Sam&rsquo;l while
      still in the cradle. The neighbours imitated her, and thus the young man
      had a better start in life than had been granted to Sammy, his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Saturday evening&mdash;the night in the week when Auld Licht young
      men fell in love. Sam&rsquo;l Dickie, wearing a blue glengarry bonnet with a red
      ball on the top, came to the door of the one-story house in the tenements,
      and stood there wriggling, for he was in a suit of tweed for the first
      time that week, and did not feel at one with them. When his feeling of
      being a stranger to himself wore off, he looked up and down the road,
      which straggles between houses and gardens, and then, picking his way over
      the puddles, crossed to his father&rsquo;s hen-house and sat down on it. He was
      now on his way to the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eppie Fargus was sitting on an adjoining dyke knitting stockings, and
      Sam&rsquo;l looked at her for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&rsquo;t yersel&rsquo;, Eppie?&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a&rsquo; that,&rdquo; said Eppie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoo&rsquo;s a&rsquo; wi&rsquo; ye?&rdquo; asked Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re juist aff an&rsquo; on,&rdquo; replied Eppie, cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not much more to say, but as Sam&rsquo;l sidled off the hen-house he
      murmured politely, &ldquo;Ay, ay.&rdquo; In another minute he would have been fairly
      started, but Eppie resumed the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam&rsquo;l,&rdquo; she said, with a twinkle in her eye, &ldquo;ye can tell Lisbeth Fargus
      I&rsquo;ll likely be drappin&rsquo; in on her aboot Mununday or Teisday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lisbeth was sister to Eppie, and wife of Tammas McQuhatty, better known as
      T&rsquo;nowhead, which was the name of his farm. She was thus Bell&rsquo;s mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam&rsquo;l leaned against the hen-house as if all his desire to depart had
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoo d&rsquo; ye kin I&rsquo;ll be at the T&rsquo;nowhead the nicht?&rdquo; he asked, grinning in
      anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ou, I&rsquo;se warrant ye&rsquo;ll be after Bell,&rdquo; said Eppie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am no sae sure o&rsquo; that,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l, trying to leer. He was enjoying
      himself now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am no sure o&rsquo; that,&rdquo; he repeated, for Eppie seemed lost in stitches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam&rsquo;l!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll be speerin&rsquo; her sune noo, I dinna doot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This took Sam&rsquo;l, who had only been courting Bell for a year or two, a
      little aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoo d&rsquo; ye mean, Eppie?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe ye&rsquo;ll do &lsquo;t the nicht.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na, there&rsquo;s nae hurry,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, we&rsquo;re a&rsquo; coontin&rsquo; on &lsquo;t, Sam&rsquo;l.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gae &lsquo;wa&rsquo; wi&rsquo; ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gae &lsquo;wa&rsquo; wi&rsquo; ye,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bell&rsquo;s gei an&rsquo; fond o&rsquo; ye, Sam&rsquo;l.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But am dootin&rsquo; ye&rsquo;re a fell billy wi&rsquo; the lasses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, oh, I d&rsquo;na kin; moderate, moderate,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l, in high delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw ye,&rdquo; said Eppie, speaking with a wire in her mouth, &ldquo;gaein&rsquo; on
      terr&rsquo;ble wi&rsquo; Mysy Haggart at the pump last Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We was juist amoosin&rsquo; oorsel&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be nae amoosement to Mysy,&rdquo; said Eppie, &ldquo;gin ye brak her heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Losh, Eppie,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l, &ldquo;I didna think o&rsquo; that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye maun kin weel, Sam&rsquo;l, &lsquo;at there&rsquo;s mony a lass wid jump at ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ou, weel,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l, implying that a man must take these things as they
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For ye&rsquo;re a dainty chield to look at, Sam&rsquo;l.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do ye think so, Eppie? Ay, ay; oh, I d&rsquo;na kin am onything by the
      ordinar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye mayna be,&rdquo; said Eppie, &ldquo;but lasses doesna do to be ower-partikler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam&rsquo;l resented this, and prepared to depart again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll no tell Bell that?&rdquo; he asked, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aboot me an&rsquo; Mysy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see hoo ye behave yersel&rsquo;, Sam&rsquo;l.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No &lsquo;at I care, Eppie; ye can tell her gin ye like. I widna think twice o&rsquo; 
      tellin&rsquo; her mysel&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord forgie ye for leein&rsquo;, Sam&rsquo;l,&rdquo; said Eppie, as he disappeared down
      Tammy Tosh&rsquo;s close. Here he came upon Henders Webster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re late, Sam&rsquo;l,&rdquo; said Henders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ou, I was thinkin&rsquo; ye wid be gaen the length o&rsquo; T&rsquo;nowhead the nicht, an&rsquo; 
      I saw Sanders Elshioner makkin&rsquo; &lsquo;s wy there an &lsquo;oor syne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did ye?&rdquo; cried Sam&rsquo;l, adding craftily, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s naething to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tod, lad,&rdquo; said Henders, &ldquo;gin ye dinna buckle to, Sanders&rsquo;ll be carryin&rsquo; 
      her off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam&rsquo;l flung back his head and passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam&rsquo;l!&rdquo; cried Henders after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l, wheeling round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gie Bell a kiss frae me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The full force of this joke struck neither all at once. Sam&rsquo;l began to
      smile at it as he turned down the school-wynd, and it came upon Henders
      while he was in his garden feeding his ferret. Then he slapped his legs
      gleefully, and explained the conceit to Will&rsquo;um Byars, who went into the
      house and thought it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were twelve or twenty little groups of men in the square, which was
      lit by a flare of oil suspended over a cadger&rsquo;s cart. Now and again a
      staid young woman passed through the square with a basket on her arm, and
      if she had lingered long enough to give them time, some of the idlers
      would have addressed her. As it was, they gazed after her, and then
      grinned to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, Sam&rsquo;l,&rdquo; said two or three young men, as Sam&rsquo;l joined them beneath the
      town clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, Davit,&rdquo; replied Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      This group was composed of some of the sharpest wits in Thrums, and it was
      not to be expected that they would let this opportunity pass. Perhaps when
      Sam&rsquo;l joined them he knew what was in store for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was ye lookin&rsquo; for T&rsquo;nowhead&rsquo;s Bell, Sam&rsquo;l?&rdquo; asked one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or mebbe ye was wantin&rsquo; the minister?&rdquo; suggested another, the same who
      had walked out twice with Chirsty Duff and not married her after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam&rsquo;l could not think of a good reply at the moment, so he laughed
      good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ondootedly she&rsquo;s a snod bit crittur,&rdquo; said Davit, archly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; michty clever wi&rsquo; her fingers,&rdquo; added Jamie Deuchars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man, I&rsquo;ve thocht o&rsquo; makkin&rsquo; up to Bell mysel&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Pete Ogle. &ldquo;Wid
      there be ony chance, think ye, Sam&rsquo;l?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; she widna hae ye for her first, Pete,&rdquo; replied Sam&rsquo;l, in one
      of those happy flashes that come to some men, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s nae sayin&rsquo; but
      what she micht tak&rsquo; ye to finish up wi&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unexpectedness of this sally startled every one. Though Sam&rsquo;l did not
      set up for a wit, however, like Davit, it was notorious that he could say
      a cutting thing once in a way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did ye ever see Bell reddin&rsquo; up?&rdquo; asked Pete, recovering from his
      overthrow. He was a man who bore no malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sicht,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l, solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoo will that be?&rdquo; asked Jamie Deuchars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s weel worth yer while,&rdquo; said Pete, &ldquo;to ging atower to the T&rsquo;nowhead
      an&rsquo; see. Ye&rsquo;ll mind the closed-in beds i&rsquo; the kitchen? Ay, weel, they&rsquo;re a
      fell spoiled crew, T&rsquo;nowhead&rsquo;s litlins, an&rsquo; no that aisy to manage. Th&rsquo; 
      ither lasses Lisbeth&rsquo;s haen had a michty trouble wi&rsquo; them. When they war
      i&rsquo; the middle o&rsquo; their reddin&rsquo; up the bairns wid come tum&rsquo;lin&rsquo; aboot the
      floor, but, sal, I assure ye, Bell didna fash lang wi&rsquo; them. Did she,
      Sam&rsquo;l?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did not,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l, dropping into a fine mode of speech to add
      emphasis to his remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell ye what she did,&rdquo; said Pete to the others. &ldquo;She juist lifted up
      the litlins, twa at a time, an&rsquo; flung them into the coffin-beds. Syne she
      snibbit the doors on them, an&rsquo; keepit them there till the floor was dry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, man, did she so?&rdquo; said Davit, admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen her do &lsquo;t mysel&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no a lassie mak&rsquo;s better bannocks this side o&rsquo; Fetter Lums,&rdquo;
       continued Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her mither tocht her that,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l; &ldquo;she was a gran&rsquo; han&rsquo; at the
      bakin&rsquo;, Kitty Ogilvy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard say,&rdquo; remarked Jamie, putting it this way so as not to tie
      himself down to anything, &ldquo;&lsquo;at Bell&rsquo;s scones is equal to Mag Lunan&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they are,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l, almost fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kin she&rsquo;s a neat han&rsquo; at singein&rsquo; a hen,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; wi&rsquo; &lsquo;t a&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Davit, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a snod, canty bit stocky in her
      Sabbath claes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If onything, thick in the waist,&rdquo; suggested Jamie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dinna see that,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I d&rsquo;na care for her hair, either,&rdquo; continued Jamie, who was very nice in
      his tastes; &ldquo;something mair yallowchy wid be an improvement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&rsquo;body kins,&rdquo; growled Sam&rsquo;l, &ldquo;&lsquo;at black hair&rsquo;s the bonniest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The others chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Puir Sam&rsquo;l!&rdquo; Pete said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam&rsquo;l, not being certain whether this should be received with a smile or a
      frown, opened his mouth wide as a kind of compromise. This was position
      one with him for thinking things over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few Auld Lichts, as I have said, went the length of choosing a helpmate
      for themselves. One day a young man&rsquo;s friends would see him mending the
      washing-tub of a maiden&rsquo;s mother. They kept the joke until Saturday night,
      and then he learned from them what he had been after. It dazed him for a
      time, but in a year or so he grew accustomed to the idea, and they were
      then married. With a little help he fell in love just like other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam&rsquo;l was going the way of the others, but he found it difficult to come
      to the point. He only went courting once a week, and he could never take
      up the running at the place where he left off the Saturday before. Thus he
      had not, so far, made great headway. His method of making up to Bell had
      been to drop in at T&rsquo;nowhead on Saturday nights and talk with the farmer
      about the rinderpest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farm kitchen was Bell&rsquo;s testimonial. Its chairs, tables, and stools
      were scoured by her to the whiteness of Rob Angus&rsquo;s sawmill boards, and
      the muslin blind on the window was starched like a child&rsquo;s pinafore. Bell
      was brave, too, as well as energetic. Once Thrums had been overrun with
      thieves. It is now thought that there may have been only one, but he had
      the wicked cleverness of a gang. Such was his repute that there were
      weavers who spoke of locking their doors when they went from home. He was
      not very skilful, however, being generally caught, and when they said they
      knew he was a robber, he gave them their things back and went away. If
      they had given him time there is no doubt that he would have gone off with
      his plunder. One night he went to T&rsquo;nowhead, and Bell, who slept in the
      kitchen, was awakened by the noise. She knew who it would be, so she rose
      and dressed herself, and went to look for him with a candle. The thief had
      not known what to do when he got in, and as it was very lonely he was glad
      to see Bell. She told him he ought to be ashamed of himself, and would not
      let him out by the door until he had taken off his boots so as not to soil
      the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this Saturday evening Sam&rsquo;l stood his ground in the square, until
      by-and-by he found himself alone. There were other groups there still, but
      his circle had melted away. They went separately, and no one said
      good-night. Each took himself off slowly, backing out of the group until
      he was fairly started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam&rsquo;l looked about him, and then, seeing that the others had gone, walked
      round the town-house into the darkness of the brae that leads down and
      then up to the farm of T&rsquo;nowhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get into the good graces of Lisbeth Fargus you had to know her ways and
      humour them. Sam&rsquo;l, who was a student of women, knew this, and so, instead
      of pushing the door open and walking in, he went through the rather
      ridiculous ceremony of knocking. Sanders Elshioner was also aware of this
      weakness of Lisbeth&rsquo;s, but though he often made up his mind to knock, the
      absurdity of the thing prevented his doing so when he reached the door.
      T&rsquo;nowhead himself had never got used to his wife&rsquo;s refined notions, and
      when any one knocked he always started to his feet, thinking there must be
      something wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisbeth came to the door, her expansive figure blocking the way in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam&rsquo;l,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lisbeth,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook hands with the farmer&rsquo;s wife, knowing that she liked it, but only
      said, &ldquo;Ay, Bell,&rdquo; to his sweetheart, &ldquo;Ay, T&rsquo;nowhead,&rdquo; to McQuhatty, and
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s yersel&rsquo;, Sanders,&rdquo; to his rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all sitting round the fire; T&rsquo;nowhead, with his feet on the
      ribs, wondering why he felt so warm; and Bell darned a stocking, while
      Lisbeth kept an eye on a goblet full of potatoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit into the fire, Sam&rsquo;l,&rdquo; said the farmer, not, however, making way for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na, na,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m to bide nae time.&rdquo; Then he sat into the fire.
      His face was turned away from Bell, and when she spoke he answered her
      without looking round. Sam&rsquo;l felt a little anxious. Sanders Elshioner, who
      had one leg shorter than the other, but looked well when sitting, seemed
      suspiciously at home. He asked Bell questions out of his own head, which
      was beyond Sam&rsquo;l, and once he said something to her in such a low voice
      that the others could not catch it. T&rsquo;nowhead asked curiously what it was,
      and Sanders explained that he had only said, &ldquo;Ay, Bell, the morn&rsquo;s the
      Sabbath.&rdquo; There was nothing startling in this, but Sam&rsquo;l did not like it.
      He began to wonder if he were too late, and had he seen his opportunity
      would have told Bell of a nasty rumour that Sanders intended to go over to
      the Free Church if they would make him kirk officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam&rsquo;l had the good-will of T&rsquo;nowhead&rsquo;s wife, who liked a polite man.
      Sanders did his best, but from want of practice he constantly made
      mistakes. To-night, for instance, he wore his hat in the house because he
      did not like to put up his hand and take it off. T&rsquo;nowhead had not taken
      his off, either, but that was because he meant to go out by-and-by and
      lock the byre door. It was impossible to say which of her lovers Bell
      preferred. The proper course with an Auld Licht lassie was to prefer the
      man who proposed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll bide a wee, an&rsquo; hae something to eat?&rdquo; Lisbeth asked Sam&rsquo;l, with
      her eyes on the goblet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I thank ye,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l, with true gentility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dinna think it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoots aye, what&rsquo;s to hender ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, since ye&rsquo;re sae pressin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ll bide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one asked Sanders to stay. Bell could not, for she was but the servant,
      and T&rsquo;nowhead knew that the kick his wife had given him meant that he was
      not to do so, either. Sanders whistled to show that he was not
      uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, then, I&rsquo;ll be stappin&rsquo; ower the brae,&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not go, however. There was sufficient pride in him to get him off
      his chair, but only slowly, for he had to get accustomed to the notion of
      going. At intervals of two or three minutes he remarked that he must now
      be going. In the same circumstances Sam&rsquo;l would have acted similarly. For
      a Thrums man, it is one of the hardest things in life to get away from
      anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Lisbeth saw that something must be done. The potatoes were
      burning, and T&rsquo;nowhead had an invitation on his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll hae to be movin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Sanders, hopelessly, for the fifth
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guid-nicht to ye, then, Sanders,&rdquo; said Lisbeth. &ldquo;Gie the door a fling-to
      ahent ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sanders, with a mighty effort, pulled himself together. He looked boldly
      at Bell, and then took off his hat carefully. Sam&rsquo;l saw with misgivings
      that there was something in it which was not a handkerchief. It was a
      paper bag glittering with gold braid, and contained such an assortment of
      sweets as lads bought for their lasses on the Muckle Friday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hae, Bell,&rdquo; said Sanders, handing the bag to Bell in an offhand way as if
      it were but a trifle. Nevertheless he was a little excited, for he went
      off without saying good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one spoke. Bell&rsquo;s face was crimson. T&rsquo;nowhead fidgeted on his chair,
      and Lisbeth looked at Sam&rsquo;l. The weaver was strangely calm and collected,
      though he would have liked to know whether this was a proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit in by to the table, Sam&rsquo;l,&rdquo; said Lisbeth, trying to look as if things
      were as they had been before.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put a saucerful of butter, salt, and pepper near the fire to melt, for
      melted butter is the shoeing-horn that helps over a meal of potatoes.
      Sam&rsquo;l, however, saw what the hour required, and, jumping up, he seized his
      bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hing the tatties higher up the joist, Lisbeth,&rdquo; he said, with dignity;
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;se be back in ten meenits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurried out of the house, leaving the others looking at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do ye think?&rdquo; asked Lisbeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I d&rsquo;na kin,&rdquo; faltered Bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thae tatties is lang o&rsquo; comin&rsquo; to the boil,&rdquo; said T&rsquo;nowhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some circles a lover who behaved like Sam&rsquo;l would have been suspected
      of intent upon his rival&rsquo;s life, but neither Bell nor Lisbeth did the
      weaver that injustice. In a case of this kind it does not much matter what
      T&rsquo;nowhead thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ten minutes had barely passed when Sam&rsquo;l was back in the farm kitchen.
      He was too flurried to knock this time, and, indeed, Lisbeth did not
      expect it of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bell, hae!&rdquo; he cried, handing his sweetheart a tinsel bag twice the size
      of Sanders&rsquo;s gift.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Losh preserve &lsquo;s!&rdquo; exclaimed Lisbeth; &ldquo;I&rsquo;se warrant there&rsquo;s a shillin&rsquo;s
      worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a&rsquo; that, Lisbeth&mdash;an&rsquo; mair,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank ye, Sam&rsquo;l,&rdquo; said Bell, feeling an unwonted elation as she gazed
      at the two paper bags in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re ower-extravegint, Sam&rsquo;l,&rdquo; Lisbeth said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l; &ldquo;not at all. But I widna advise ye to eat thae
      ither anes, Bell&mdash;they&rsquo;re second quality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bell drew back a step from Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do ye kin?&rdquo; asked the farmer, shortly, for he liked Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speered i&rsquo; the shop,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goblet was placed on a broken plate on the table, with the saucer
      beside it, and Sam&rsquo;l, like the others, helped himself. What he did was to
      take potatoes from the pot with his fingers, peel off their coats, and
      then dip them into the butter. Lisbeth would have liked to provide knives
      and forks, but she knew that beyond a certain point T&rsquo;nowhead was master
      in his own house. As for Sam&rsquo;l, he felt victory in his hands, and began to
      think that he had gone too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Sanders, little witting that Sam&rsquo;l had trumped his trick,
      was sauntering along the kirk-wynd with his hat on the side of his head.
      Fortunately he did not meet the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courting of T&rsquo;nowhead&rsquo;s Bell reached its crisis one Sabbath about a
      month after the events above recorded. The minister was in great force
      that day, but it is no part of mine to tell how he bore himself. I was
      there, and am not likely to forget the scene. It was a fateful Sabbath for
      T&rsquo;nowhead&rsquo;s Bell and her swains, and destined to be remembered for the
      painful scandal which they perpetrated in their passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bell was not in the kirk. There being an infant of six months in the house
      it was a question of either Lisbeth or the lassie&rsquo;s staying at home with
      him, and though Lisbeth was unselfish in a general way, she could not
      resist the delight of going to church. She had nine children besides the
      baby, and, being but a woman, it was the pride of her life to march them
      into the T&rsquo;nowhead pew, so well watched that they dared not misbehave, and
      so tightly packed that they could not fall. The congregation looked at
      that pew, the mothers enviously, when they sang the lines:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Jerusalem like a city is
     Compactly built together.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The first half of the service had been gone through on this particular
      Sunday without anything remarkable happening. It was at the end of the
      psalm which preceded the sermon that Sanders Elshioner, who sat near the
      door, lowered his head until it was no higher than the pews, and in that
      attitude, looking almost like a four-footed animal, slipped out of the
      church. In their eagerness to be at the sermon many of the congregation
      did not notice him, and those who did put the matter by in their minds for
      future investigation. Sam&rsquo;l however, could not take it so coolly. From his
      seat in the gallery he saw Sanders disappear, and his mind misgave him.
      With the true lover&rsquo;s instinct he understood it all. Sanders had been
      struck by the fine turnout in the T&rsquo;nowhead pew. Bell was alone at the
      farm. What an opportunity to work one&rsquo;s way up to a proposal! T&rsquo;nowhead
      was so overrun with children that such a chance seldom occurred, except on
      a Sabbath. Sanders, doubtless, was off to propose, and he, Sam&rsquo;l, was left
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suspense was terrible. Sam&rsquo;l and Sanders had both known all along that
      Bell would take the first of the two who asked her. Even those who thought
      her proud admitted that she was modest. Bitterly the weaver repented
      having waited so long. Now it was too late. In ten minutes Sanders would
      be at T&rsquo;nowhead; in an hour all would be over. Sam&rsquo;l rose to his feet in a
      daze. His mother pulled him down by the coat-tail, and his father shook
      him, thinking he was walking in his sleep. He tottered past them, however,
      hurried up the aisle, which was so narrow that Dan&rsquo;l Ross could only reach
      his seat by walking sideways, and was gone before the minister could do
      more than stop in the middle of a whirl and gape in horror after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A number of the congregation felt that day the advantage of sitting in the
      loft. What was a mystery to those downstairs was revealed to them. From
      the gallery windows they had a fine open view to the south; and as Sam&rsquo;l
      took the common, which was a short cut through a steep ascent, to
      T&rsquo;nowhead, he was never out of their line of vision. Sanders was not to be
      seen, but they guessed rightly the reason why. Thinking he had ample time,
      he had gone round by the main road to save his boots&mdash;perhaps a
      little scared by what was coming. Sam&rsquo;l&rsquo;s design was to forestall him by
      taking the shorter path over the burn and up the commonty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a race for a wife, and several onlookers in the gallery braved the
      minister&rsquo;s displeasure to see who won. Those who favoured Sam&rsquo;l&rsquo;s suit
      exultingly saw him leap the stream, while the friends of Sanders fixed
      their eyes on the top of the common where it ran into the road. Sanders
      must come into sight there, and the one who reached this point first would
      get Bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Auld Lichts do not walk abroad on the Sabbath, Sanders would probably
      not be delayed. The chances were in his favour. Had it been any other day
      in the week Sam&rsquo;l might have run. So some of the congregation in the
      gallery were thinking, when suddenly they saw him bend low and then take
      to his heels. He had caught sight of Sanders&rsquo;s head bobbing over the hedge
      that separated the road from the common, and feared that Sanders might see
      him. The congregation who could crane their necks sufficiently saw a black
      object, which they guessed to be the carter&rsquo;s hat, crawling along the
      hedge-top. For a moment it was motionless, and then it shot ahead. The
      rivals had seen each other. It was now a hot race. Sam&rsquo;l dissembling no
      longer, clattered up the common, becoming smaller and smaller to the
      onlookers as he neared the top. More than one person in the gallery almost
      rose to their feet in their excitement. Sam&rsquo;l had it. No, Sanders was in
      front. Then the two figures disappeared from view. They seemed to run into
      each other at the top of the brae, and no one could say who was first. The
      congregation looked at one another. Some of them perspired. But the
      minister held on his course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam&rsquo;l had just been in time to cut Sanders out. It was the weaver&rsquo;s saving
      that Sanders saw this when his rival turned the corner; for Sam&rsquo;l was
      sadly blown. Sanders took in the situation and gave in at once. The last
      hundred yards of the distance he covered at his leisure, and when he
      arrived at his destination he did not go in. It was a fine afternoon for
      the time of year, and he went round to have a look at the pig, about which
      T&rsquo;nowhead was a little sinfully puffed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Sanders, digging his fingers critically into the grunting
      animal, &ldquo;quite so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grumph,&rdquo; said the pig, getting reluctantly to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ou, ay, yes,&rdquo; said Sanders thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sat down on the edge of the sty, and looked long and silently at
      an empty bucket. But whether his thoughts were of T&rsquo;nowhead&rsquo;s Bell, whom
      he had lost for ever, or of the food the farmer fed his pig on, is not
      known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord preserve &lsquo;s! are ye no at the kirk?&rdquo; cried Bell, nearly dropping the
      baby as Sam&rsquo;l broke into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bell!&rdquo; cried Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then T&rsquo;nowhead&rsquo;s Bell knew that her hour had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam&rsquo;l,&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will ye hae &lsquo;s, Bell?&rdquo; demanded Sam&rsquo;l, glaring at her sheepishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; answered Bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam&rsquo;l fell into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring &lsquo;s a drink o&rsquo; water, Bell,&rdquo; he said. But Bell thought the occasion
      required milk, and there was none in the kitchen. She went out to the
      byre, still with the baby in her arms, and saw Sanders Elshioner sitting
      gloomily on the pigsty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, Bell,&rdquo; said Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thocht ye&rsquo;d been at the kirk, Sanders,&rdquo; said Bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a silence between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Sam&rsquo;l speered ye, Bell?&rdquo; asked Sanders, stolidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Bell again, and this time there was a tear in her eye. Sanders
      was little better than an &ldquo;orra man,&rdquo; and Sam&rsquo;l was a weaver, and yet&mdash;But
      it was too late now. Sanders gave the pig a vicious poke with a stick, and
      when it had ceased to grunt, Bell was back in the kitchen. She had
      forgotten about the milk, however, and Sam&rsquo;l only got water after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      In after-days, when the story of Bell&rsquo;s wooing was told, there were some
      who held that the circumstances would have almost justified the lassie in
      giving Sam&rsquo;l the go-by. But these perhaps forgot that her other lover was
      in the same predicament as the accepted one&mdash;that of the two, indeed,
      he was the more to blame, for he set off to T&rsquo;nowhead on the Sabbath of
      his own accord, while Sam&rsquo;l only ran after him. And then there is no one
      to say for certain whether Bell heard of her suitors&rsquo; delinquencies until
      Lisbeth&rsquo;s return from the kirk. Sam&rsquo;l could never remember whether he told
      her, and Bell was not sure whether, if he did, she took it in. Sanders was
      greatly in demand for weeks to tell what he knew of the affair, but though
      he was twice asked to tea to the manse among the trees, and subjected
      thereafter to ministerial cross-examinations, this is all he told. He
      remained at the pigsty until Sam&rsquo;l left the farm, when he joined him at
      the top of the brae, and they went home together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s yersel&rsquo;, Sanders,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so, Sam&rsquo;l,&rdquo; said Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very cauld,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blawy,&rdquo; assented Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam&rsquo;l,&rdquo; said Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hearing ye&rsquo;re to be mairit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, Sam&rsquo;l, she&rsquo;s a snod bit lassie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank ye,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had ance a kin o&rsquo; notion o&rsquo; Bell mysel&rsquo;,&rdquo; continued Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye had?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sam&rsquo;l; but I thocht better o&rsquo; &lsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoo d&rsquo; ye mean?&rdquo; asked Sam&rsquo;l, a little anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, Sam&rsquo;l, mairitch is a terrible responsibeelity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l, wincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; no the thing to tak&rsquo; up withoot conseederation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a blessed and honourable state, Sanders; ye&rsquo;ve heard the
      minister on &lsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say,&rdquo; continued the relentless Sanders, &ldquo;&lsquo;at the minister doesna get
      on sair wi&rsquo; the wife himsel&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they do,&rdquo; cried Sam&rsquo;l, with a sinking at the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been telt,&rdquo; Sanders went on, &ldquo;&lsquo;at gin ye can get the upper han&rsquo; o&rsquo; 
      the wife for a while at first, there&rsquo;s the mair chance o&rsquo; a harmonious
      exeestence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bell&rsquo;s no the lassie,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l, appealingly, &ldquo;to thwart her man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sanders smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo; ye think she is, Sanders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, Sam&rsquo;l, I d&rsquo;na want to fluster ye, but she&rsquo;s been ower-lang wi&rsquo; 
      Lisbeth Fargus no to hae learned her ways. An&rsquo; a&rsquo;body kins what a life
      T&rsquo;nowhead has wi&rsquo; her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guid sake, Sanders, hoo did ye no speak o&rsquo; this afore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thocht ye kent o&rsquo; &lsquo;t, Sam&rsquo;l.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had now reached the square, and the U. P. kirk was coming out. The
      Auld Licht kirk would be half an hour yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Sanders,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l, brightening up, &ldquo;ye was on yer wy to speer her
      yersel&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was, Sam&rsquo;l,&rdquo; said Sanders, &ldquo;and I canna but be thankfu&rsquo; ye was
      ower-quick for &lsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gin &lsquo;t hadna been you,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l, &ldquo;I wid never hae thocht o&rsquo; &lsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying naething agin Bell,&rdquo; pursued the other, &ldquo;but, man, Sam&rsquo;l, a
      body should be mair deleeberate in a thing o&rsquo; the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was michty hurried,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l wofully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a serious thing to speer a lassie,&rdquo; said Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awfu&rsquo; thing,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll hope for the best,&rdquo; added Sanders, in a hopeless voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were close to the tenements now, and Sam&rsquo;l looked as if he were on
      his way to be hanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam&rsquo;l!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, Sanders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did ye&mdash;did ye kiss her, Sam&rsquo;l?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s was varra little time, Sanders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half an &lsquo;oor,&rdquo; said Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there? Man Sanders, to tell ye the truth, I never thocht o&rsquo; &lsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the soul of Sanders Elshioner was filled with contempt for Sam&rsquo;l
      Dickie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scandal blew over. At first it was expected that the minister would
      interfere to prevent the union, but beyond intimating from the pulpit that
      the souls of Sabbath-breakers were beyond praying for, and then praying
      for Sam&rsquo;l and Sanders at great length, with a word thrown in for Bell, he
      let things take their course. Some said it was because he was always
      frightened lest his young men should intermarry with other denominations,
      but Sanders explained it differently to Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hav&rsquo;na a word to say agin&rsquo; the minister,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re gran&rsquo; 
      prayers; but, Sam&rsquo;l, he&rsquo;s a mairit man himsel&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a&rsquo; the better for that, Sanders, isna he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do ye no see,&rdquo; asked Sanders, compassionately, &ldquo;&lsquo;at he&rsquo;s trying to mak&rsquo; 
      the best o&rsquo; &lsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Sanders, man!&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up, Sam&rsquo;l,&rdquo; said Sanders; &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll sune be ower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their having been rival suitors had not interfered with their friendship.
      On the contrary, while they had hitherto been mere acquaintances, they
      became inseparables as the wedding-day drew near. It was noticed that they
      had much to say to each other, and that when they could not get a room to
      themselves they wandered about together in the churchyard. When Sam&rsquo;l had
      anything to tell Bell he sent Sanders to tell it, and Sanders did as he
      was bid. There was nothing that he would not have done for Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more obliging Sanders was, however, the sadder Sam&rsquo;l grew. He never
      laughed now on Saturdays, and sometimes his loom was silent half the day.
      Sam&rsquo;l felt that Sanders&rsquo;s was the kindness of a friend for a dying man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to be a penny wedding, and Lisbeth Fargus said it was the delicacy
      that made Sam&rsquo;l superintend the fitting up of the barn by deputy. Once he
      came to see it in person, but he looked so ill that Sanders had to see him
      home. This was on the Thursday afternoon, and the wedding was fixed for
      Friday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sanders, Sanders,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l, in a voice strangely unlike his own,
      &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll a&rsquo; be ower by this time the morn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will,&rdquo; said Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had only kent her langer,&rdquo; continued Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wid hae been safer,&rdquo; said Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did ye see the yallow floor in Bell&rsquo;s bonnet?&rdquo; asked the accepted swain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Sanders, reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dootin&rsquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;m sair dootin&rsquo; she&rsquo;s but a flichty, light-hearted
      crittur after a&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had aye my suspeecions o&rsquo; &lsquo;t,&rdquo; said Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye hae kent her langer than me,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sanders, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s nae getting&rsquo; at the heart o&rsquo; women. Man
      Sam&rsquo;l, they&rsquo;re desperate cunnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dootin&rsquo; &lsquo;t; I&rsquo;m sair dootin&rsquo; &lsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a warnin&rsquo; to ye, Sam&rsquo;l, no to be in sic a hurry i&rsquo; the futur&rsquo;,&rdquo;
       said Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam&rsquo;l groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll be gaein&rsquo; up to the manse to arrange wi&rsquo; the minister the morn&rsquo;s
      mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; continued Sanders, in a subdued voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam&rsquo;l looked wistfully at his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I canna do &lsquo;t, Sanders,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I canna do &lsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye maun,&rdquo; said Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s aisy to speak,&rdquo; retorted Sam&rsquo;l, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a&rsquo; oor troubles, Sam&rsquo;l,&rdquo; said Sanders, soothingly, &ldquo;an&rsquo; every man
      maun bear his ain burdens. Johnny Davie&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s dead, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s no
      repinin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l, &ldquo;but a death&rsquo;s no a mairitch. We hae haen deaths in our
      family too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may a&rsquo; be for the best,&rdquo; added Sanders, &ldquo;an&rsquo; there wid be a michty
      talk i&rsquo; the hale country-side gin ye didna ging to the minister like a
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I maun hae langer to think o&rsquo; &lsquo;t,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bell&rsquo;s mairitch is the morn,&rdquo; said Sanders, decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam&rsquo;l glanced up with a wild look in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sanders!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam&rsquo;l!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye hae been a guid friend to me, Sanders, in this sair affliction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing ava,&rdquo; said Sanders; &ldquo;doun&rsquo;t mention &lsquo;d.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Sanders, ye canna deny but what your rinnin&rsquo; oot o&rsquo; the kirk that
      awfu&rsquo; day was at the bottom o&rsquo; &lsquo;d a&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was so,&rdquo; said Sanders, bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; ye used to be fond o&rsquo; Bell, Sanders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dinna deny &lsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sanders, laddie,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l, bending forward and speaking in a wheedling
      voice, &ldquo;I aye thocht it was you she likit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had some sic idea mysel&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sanders, I canna think to pairt twa fowk sae weel suited to ane anither
      as you an&rsquo; Bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Canna ye, Sam&rsquo;l?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wid mak&rsquo; ye a guid wife, Sanders. I hae studied her weel, and she&rsquo;s a
      thrifty, douce, clever lassie. Sanders, there&rsquo;s no the like o&rsquo; her. Mony a
      time, Sanders, I hae said to mysel&rsquo;, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a lass ony man micht be
      prood to tak&rsquo;.&rsquo; A&rsquo;body says the same, Sanders. There&rsquo;s nae risk ava, man&mdash;nane
      to speak o&rsquo;. Tak&rsquo; her, laddie; tak&rsquo; her, Sanders; it&rsquo;s a gran&rsquo; chance,
      Sanders. She&rsquo;s yours for the speerin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ll gie her up, Sanders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will ye, though?&rdquo; said Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d&rsquo; ye think?&rdquo; asked Sam&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ye wid rayther,&rdquo; said Sanders, politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s my han&rsquo; on &lsquo;t,&rdquo; said Sam&rsquo;l. &ldquo;Bless ye, Sanders; ye&rsquo;ve been a true
      frien&rsquo; to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they shook hands for the first time in their lives, and soon
      afterward Sanders struck up the brae to T&rsquo;nowhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Sanders Elshioner, who had been very busy the night before,
      put on his Sabbath clothes and strolled up to the manse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but where is Sam&rsquo;l?&rdquo; asked the minister; &ldquo;I must see himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new arrangement,&rdquo; said Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Sanders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bell&rsquo;s to marry me,&rdquo; explained Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but what does Sam&rsquo;l say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s willin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Bell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s willin&rsquo; too. She prefers &lsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is unusual,&rdquo; said the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a&rsquo; richt,&rdquo; said Sanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know best,&rdquo; said the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see the hoose was taen, at ony rate,&rdquo; continued Sanders, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
      juist ging in til &lsquo;t instead o&rsquo; Sam&rsquo;l.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; I cudna think to disappoint the lassie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sentiments do you credit, Sanders,&rdquo; said the minister; &ldquo;but I hope
      you do not enter upon the blessed state of matrimony without full
      consideration of its responsibilities. It is a serious business,
      marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a&rsquo; that,&rdquo; said Sanders, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m willin&rsquo; to stan&rsquo; the risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, as soon as it could be done, Sanders Elshioner took to wife
      T&rsquo;nowhead&rsquo;s Bell, and I remember seeing Sam&rsquo;l Dickie trying to dance at
      the penny wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Years afterward it was said in Thrums that Sam&rsquo;l had treated Bell badly,
      but he was never sure about it himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a near thing&mdash;a michty near thing,&rdquo; he admitted in the
      square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say,&rdquo; some other weaver would remark, &ldquo;&lsquo;at it was you Bell liked
      best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I d&rsquo;na kin,&rdquo; Sam&rsquo;l would reply; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s nae doot the lassie was fell
      fond o&rsquo; me; ou, a mere passin&rsquo; fancy, &lsquo;s ye micht say.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      &ldquo;THE HEATHER LINTIE&rdquo;, By S. R. Crockett
    </h2>
    <p>
      Janet Balchrystie lived in a little cottage at the back of the Long Wood
      of Barbrax. She had been a hard-working woman all her days, for her mother
      died when she was but young, and she had lived on, keeping her father&rsquo;s
      house by the side of the single-track railway-line. Gavin Balchrystie was
      a foreman plate-layer on the P.P.R., and with two men under him, had
      charge of a section of three miles. He lived just where that distinguished
      but impecunious line plunges into a moss-covered granite wilderness of
      moor and bog, where there is not more than a shepherd&rsquo;s hut to the
      half-dozen miles, and where the passage of a train is the occasion of
      commotion among scattered groups of black-faced sheep. Gavin Balchrystie&rsquo;s
      three miles of P.P.R. metals gave him little work, but a good deal of
      healthy exercise. The black-faced sheep breaking down the fences and
      straying on the line side, and the torrents coming down the granite
      gullies, foaming white after a water-spout, and tearing into his
      embankments, undermining his chairs and plates, were the only troubles of
      his life. There was, however, a little public-house at The Huts, which in
      the old days of construction had had the license, and which had lingered
      alone, license and all, when its immediate purpose in life had been
      fulfilled, because there was nobody but the whaups and the railway
      officials on the passing trains to object to its continuance. Now it is
      cold and blowy on the west-land moors, and neither whaups nor dark-blue
      uniforms object to a little refreshment up there. The mischief was that
      Gavin Balchrystie did not, like the guards and engine-drivers, go on with
      the passing train. He was always on the spot, and the path through Barbrax
      Wood to the Railway Inn was as well trodden as that which led over the bog
      moss, where the whaups built, to the great white viaduct of Loch Merrick,
      where his three miles of parallel gleaming responsibility began.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his wife was but newly dead, and his Janet just a smart elf-locked
      lassie running to and from the school, Gavin got too much in the way of
      &ldquo;slippin&rsquo; doon by.&rdquo; When Janet grew to be woman muckle, Gavin kept the
      habit, and Janet hardly knew that it was not the use and wont of all
      fathers to sidle down to a contiguous Railway Arms, and return some hours
      later with uncertain step, and face pricked out with bright pin-points of
      red&mdash;the sure mark of the confirmed drinker of whisky neat.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were long days in the cottage at the back of Barbrax Long Wood. The
      little &ldquo;but an&rsquo; ben&rdquo; was whitewashed till it dazzled the eyes as you came
      over the brae to it and found it set against the solemn depths of
      dark-green firwood. From early morn, when she saw her father off, till the
      dusk of the day, when he would return for his supper, Janet Balchrystie
      saw no human being. She heard the muffled roar of the trains through the
      deep cutting at the back of the wood, but she herself was entirely out of
      sight of the carriagefuls of travellers whisking past within half a mile
      of her solitude and meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet was what is called a &ldquo;through-gaun lass,&rdquo; and her work for the day
      was often over by eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Janet grew to womanhood
      without a sweetheart. She was plain, and she looked plainer than she was
      in the dresses which she made for herself by the light of nature and what
      she could remember of the current fashions at Merrick Kirk, to which she
      went every alternate Sunday. Her father and she took day about. Wet or
      shine, she tramped to Merrick Kirk, even when the rain blattered and the
      wind raved and bleated alternately among the pines of the Long Wood of
      Barbrax. Her father had a simpler way of spending his day out. He went
      down to the Railway Inn and drank &ldquo;ginger-beer&rdquo; all day with the landlord.
      Ginger-beer is an unsteadying beverage when taken the day by the length.
      Also the man who drinks it steadily and quietly never enters on any
      inheritance of length of days.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it came to pass that one night Gavin Balchrystie did not come home at
      all&mdash;at least, not till he was brought lying comfortably on the door
      of a disused third-class carriage, which was now seeing out its career
      anchored under the bank at Loch Merrick, where Gavin had used it as a
      shelter. The driver of the &ldquo;six-fifty up&rdquo; train had seen him walking
      soberly along toward The Huts (and the Railway Inn), letting his long
      surface-man&rsquo;s hammer fall against the rail-keys occasionally as he walked.
      He saw him bend once, as though his keen ear detected a false ring in a
      loose length between two plates. This was the last that was seen of him
      till the driver of the &ldquo;nine-thirty-seven down&rdquo; express&mdash;the
      &ldquo;boat-train,&rdquo; as the employees of the P.P.R. call it, with a touch of
      respect in their voices&mdash;passed Gavin fallen forward on his face just
      when he was flying down grade under a full head of steam. It was duskily
      clear, with a great lake of crimson light dying into purple over the hills
      of midsummer heather. The driver was John Platt, the Englishman from
      Crewe, who had been brought from the great London and Northwestern
      Railway, locally known as &ldquo;The Ell-nen-doubleyou.&rdquo; In these remote railway
      circles the talk is as exclusively of matters of the four-foot way as in
      Crewe or Derby. There is an inspector of traffic, whose portly presence
      now graces Carlisle Station, who left the P.P.R. in these sad days of
      amalgamation, because he could not endure to see so many &ldquo;Sou&rsquo;west&rdquo;
       waggons passing over the sacred metals of the P.P.R. permanent way. From
      his youth he had been trained in a creed of two articles: &ldquo;To swear by the
      P.P.R. through thick and thin, and hate the apple green of the
      &lsquo;Sou&rsquo;west.&rsquo;&rdquo; It was as much as he could do to put up with the sight of the
      abominations; to have to hunt for their trucks when they got astray was
      more than mortal could stand, so he fled the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when they stopped the express for Gavin Balchrystie, every man on the
      line felt that it was an honour to the dead. John Platt sent a &ldquo;gurring&rdquo;
       thrill through the train as he put his brakes hard down and whistled for
      the guard. He, thinking that the Merrick Viaduct was down at least,
      twirled his brake to such purpose that the rear car progressed along the
      metals by a series of convulsive bounds. Then they softly ran back, and
      there lay Gavin fallen forward on his knees, as though he had been trying
      to rise, or had knelt down to pray. Let him have &ldquo;the benefit of the
      doubt&rdquo; in this world. In the next, if all tales be true, there is no such
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Janet Balchrystie dwelt alone in the white &ldquo;but an&rsquo; ben&rdquo; at the back of
      the Long Wood of Barbrax. The factor gave her notice, but the laird, who
      was not accounted by his neighbours to be very wise, because he did
      needlessly kind things, told the factor to let the lassie bide, and
      delivered to herself with his own handwriting to the effect that Janet
      Balchrystie, in consideration of her lonely condition, was to be allowed
      the house for her lifetime, a cow&rsquo;s grass, and thirty pound sterling in
      the year as a charge on the estate. He drove down the cow himself, and
      having stalled it in the byre, he informed her of the fact over the yard
      dyke by word of mouth, for he never could be induced to enter her door. He
      was accounted to be &ldquo;gey an&rsquo; queer,&rdquo; save by those who had tried making a
      bargain with him. But his farmers liked him, knowing him to be an easy man
      with those who had been really unfortunate, for he knew to what the year&rsquo;s
      crops of each had amounted, to a single chalder and head of nowt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deep in her heart Janet Balchrystie cherished a great ambition. When the
      earliest blackbird awoke and began to sing, while it was yet gray
      twilight, Janet would be up and at her work. She had an ambition to be a
      great poet. No less than this would serve her. But not even her father had
      known, and no other had any chance of knowing. In the black leather chest,
      which had been her mother&rsquo;s, upstairs, there was a slowly growing pile of
      manuscript, and the editor of the local paper received every other week a
      poem, longer or shorter, for his Poet&rsquo;s Corner, in an envelope with the
      New Dalry postmark. He was an obliging editor, and generally gave the
      closely written manuscript to the senior office boy, who had passed the
      sixth standard, to cut down, tinker the rhymes, and lope any superfluity
      of feet. The senior office boy &ldquo;just spread himself,&rdquo; as he said, and
      delighted to do the job in style. But there was a woman fading into a gray
      old-maidishness which had hardly ever been girlhood, who did not at all
      approve of these corrections. She endured them because over the signature
      of &ldquo;Heather Bell&rdquo; it was a joy to see in the rich, close luxury of type
      her own poetry, even though it might be a trifle tattered and tossed about
      by hands ruthless and alien&mdash;those, in fact, of the senior office
      boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet walked every other week to the post-office at New Dalry to post her
      letters to the editor, but neither the great man nor yet the senior office
      boy had any conception that the verses of their &ldquo;esteemed correspondent&rdquo;
       were written by a woman too early old who dwelt alone at the back of
      Barbrax Long Wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Janet took a sudden but long-meditated journey. She went down by
      rail from the little station of The Huts to the large town of Drum, thirty
      miles to the east. Here, with the most perfect courage and dignity of
      bearing, she interviewed a printer and arranged for the publication of her
      poems in their own original form, no longer staled and clapper-clawed by
      the pencil of the senior office boy. When the proof-sheets came to Janet,
      she had no way of indicating the corrections but by again writing the
      whole poem out in a neat print hand on the edge of the proof, and
      underscoring the words which were to be altered. This, when you think of
      it, is a very good way, when the happiest part of your life is to be spent
      in such concrete pleasures of hope, as Janet&rsquo;s were over the crackly
      sheets of the printer of Drum. Finally the book was produced, a small
      rather thickish octavo, on sufficiently wretched gray paper which had
      suffered from want of thorough washing in the original paper-mill. It was
      bound in a peculiarly deadly blue, of a rectified Reckitt tint, which gave
      you dazzles in the eye at any distance under ten paces. Janet had selected
      this as the most appropriate of colours. She had also many years ago
      decided upon the title, so that Reckitt had printed upon it, back and
      side, &ldquo;The Heather Lintie,&rdquo; while inside there was the acknowledgment of
      authorship, which Janet felt to be a solemn duty to the world: &ldquo;Poems by
      Janet Balchrystie, Barbrax Cottage, by New Dalry.&rdquo; First she had thought
      of withholding her name and style; but, on the whole, after the most
      prolonged consideration, she felt that she was not justified in bringing
      about such a controversy as divided Scotland concerning that &ldquo;Great
      Unknown&rdquo; who wrote the Waverley Novels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost every second or third day Janet trod that long lochside road to New
      Dalry for her proof-sheets, and returned them on the morrow corrected in
      her own way. Sometimes she got a lift from some farmer or carter, for she
      had worn herself with anxiety to the shadow of what she had once been, and
      her dry bleached hair became gray and grayer with the fervour of her
      devotion to letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      By April the book was published, and at the end of this month, laid aside
      by sickness of the vague kind called locally &ldquo;a decline,&rdquo; she took to her
      bed, rising only to lay a few sticks upon the fire from her store gathered
      in the autumn, or to brew herself a cup of tea. She waited for the tokens
      of her book&rsquo;s conquests in the great world of thought and men. She had
      waited so long for her recognition, and now it was coming. She felt that
      it would not be long before she was recognised as one of the singers of
      the world. Indeed, had she but known it, her recognition was already on
      its way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a great city of the north a clever young reporter was cutting open the
      leaves of &ldquo;The Heather Lintie&rdquo; with a hand almost feverishly eager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a perfect treasure. This is a find indeed. Here is my chance
      ready to my hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His paper was making a specialty of &ldquo;exposures.&rdquo; If there was anything
      weak and erring, anything particularly helpless and foolish which could
      make no stand for itself, the &ldquo;Night Hawk&rdquo; was on the pounce. Hitherto the
      junior reporter had never had a &ldquo;two-column chance.&rdquo; He had read&mdash;it
      was not much that he <i>had</i> read&mdash;Macaulay&rsquo;s too famous article
      on &ldquo;Satan&rdquo; Montgomery, and, not knowing that Macaulay lived to regret the
      spirit of that assault, he felt that if he could bring down the &ldquo;Night
      Hawk&rdquo; on &ldquo;The Heather Lintie,&rdquo; his fortune was made. So he sat down and he
      wrote, not knowing and not regarding a lonely woman&rsquo;s heart, to whom his
      word would be as the word of a God, in the lonely cottage lying in the lee
      of the Long Wood of Barbrax.
    </p>
    <p>
      The junior reporter turned out a triumph of the new journalism. &ldquo;This is a
      book which may be a genuine source of pride to every native of the ancient
      province of Galloway,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Galloway has been celebrated for black
      cattle and for wool, as also for a certain bucolic belatedness of
      temperament, but Galloway has never hitherto produced a poetess. One has
      arisen in the person of Miss Janet Bal&mdash; something or other. We have
      not an interpreter at hand, and so cannot wrestle with the intricacies of
      the authoress&rsquo;s name, which appears to be some Galwegian form of Erse or
      Choctaw. Miss Bal&mdash;and so forth&mdash;has a true fount of pathos and
      humour. In what touching language she chronicles the death of two young
      lambs which fell down into one of the puddles they call rivers down there,
      and were either drowned or choked with the dirt:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;&lsquo;They were two bonny, bonny lambs,
     That played upon the daisied lea,
     And loudly mourned their woolly dams
     Above the drumly flowing Dee.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How touchingly simple!&rdquo; continued the junior reporter, buckling up his
      sleeves to enjoy himself, and feeling himself born to be a &ldquo;Saturday
      Reviewer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark the local colour, the wool and the dirty water of the Dee&mdash;without
      doubt a name applied to one of their bigger ditches down there. Mark also
      the over-fervency of the touching line,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;&lsquo;And loudly mourned their woolly dams,&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which, but for the sex of the writer and her evident genius, might be
      taken for an expression of a strength hardly permissible even in the
      metropolis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The junior reporter filled his two columns and enjoyed himself in the
      doing of it. He concluded with the words: &ldquo;The authoress will make a great
      success. If she will come to the capital, where genius is always
      appreciated, she will, without doubt, make her fortune. Nay, if Miss Bal&mdash;but
      again we cannot proceed for the want of an interpreter&mdash;if Miss B.,
      we say, will only accept a position at Cleary&rsquo;s Waxworks and give readings
      from her poetry, or exhibit herself in the act of pronouncing her own
      name, she will be a greater draw in this city than Punch and Judy, or even
      the latest American advertising evangelist, who preaches standing on his
      head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The junior reporter ceased here from very admiration at his own cleverness
      in so exactly hitting the tone of the masters of his craft, and handed his
      manuscript in to the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the gloaming of a long June day when Rob Affleck, the woodman over
      at Barbrax, having been at New Dalry with a cart of wood, left his horse
      on the roadside and ran over through Gavin&rsquo;s old short cut, now seldom
      used, to Janet&rsquo;s cottage with a paper in a yellow wrapper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave it on the step, and thank you kindly, Rob,&rdquo; said a weak voice
      within; and Rob, anxious about his horse and his bed, did so without
      another word. In a moment or two Janet crawled to the door, listened to
      make sure that Rob was really gone, opened the door, and protruded a hand
      wasted to the hard, flat bone&mdash;an arm that ought for years to have
      been full of flesh and noble curves.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Janet got back to bed it was too dark to see anything except the big
      printing at the top of the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two columns of it!&rdquo; said Janet, with great thankfulness in her heart,
      lifting up her soul to God who had given her the power to sing. She
      strained her prematurely old and weary eyes to make out the sense. &ldquo;A
      genuine source of pride to every native of the ancient province,&rdquo; she
      read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord be praised!&rdquo; said Janet, in a rapture of devout thankfulness;
      &ldquo;though I never really doubted it,&rdquo; she added, as though asking pardon for
      a moment&rsquo;s distrust. &ldquo;But I tried to write these poems to the glory of God
      and not to my own praise, and He will accept them and keep me humble under
      the praise of men as well as under their neglect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So clutching the precious paper close to her breast, and letting tears of
      thankfulness fall on the article, which, had they fallen on the head of
      the junior reporter, would have burned like fire, she patiently awaited
      the coming dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can wait till the morning now to read the rest,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      So hour after hour, with her eyes wide, staring hard at the gray
      window-squares, she waited the dawn from the east. About half-past two
      there was a stirring and a moaning among the pines, and the roar of the
      sudden gust came with the breaking day through the dark arches. In the
      whirlwind there came a strange expectancy and tremor into the heart of the
      poetess, and she pressed the wet sheet of crumpled paper closer to her
      bosom, and turned to face the light. Through the spaces of the Long Wood
      of Barbrax there came a shining visitor, the Angel of the Presence, he who
      comes but once and stands a moment with a beckoning finger. Him she
      followed up through the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found Janet on the morning of the second day after, with a look so
      glad on her face, and so natural an expectation in the unclosed eye, that
      Rob Affleck spoke to her and expected an answer. The &ldquo;Night Hawk&rdquo; was
      clasped to her breast with a hand that they could not loosen. It went to
      the grave with her body. The ink had run a little here and there, where
      the tears had fallen thickest.
    </p>
    <p>
      God is more merciful than man.

      A DOCTOR OF THE OLD SCHOOL, By Ian Maclaren

    </h3>
    <p>
      I A GENERAL PRACTITIONER
    </p>
    <p>
      Drumtochty was accustomed to break every law of health, except wholesome
      food and fresh air, and yet had reduced the psalmist&rsquo;s furthest limit to
      an average life-rate. Our men made no difference in their clothes for
      summer or winter, Drumsheugh and one or two of the larger farmers
      condescending to a top-coat on Sabbath, as a penalty of their position,
      and without regard to temperature. They wore their blacks at a funeral,
      refusing to cover them with anything, out of respect to the deceased, and
      standing longest in the kirkyard when the north wind was blowing across a
      hundred miles of snow. If the rain was pouring at the junction, then
      Drumtochty stood two minutes longer through sheer native dourness till
      each man had a cascade from the tail of his coat, and hazarded the
      suggestion, half-way to Kildrummie, that it had been &ldquo;a bit scrowie,&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;scrowie&rdquo; being as far short of a &ldquo;shoor&rdquo; as a &ldquo;shoor&rdquo; fell below &ldquo;weet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sustained defiance of the elements provoked occasional judgments in
      the shape of a &ldquo;hoast&rdquo; (cough), and the head of the house was then
      exhorted by his women folk to &ldquo;change his feet&rdquo; if he had happened to walk
      through a burn on his way home, and was pestered generally with sanitary
      precautions. It is right to add that the gudeman treated such advice with
      contempt, regarding it as suitable for the effeminacy of towns, but not
      seriously intended for Drumtochty. Sandy Stewart &ldquo;napped&rdquo; stones on the
      road in his shirt-sleeves, wet or fair, summer and winter, till he was
      persuaded to retire from active duty at eighty-five, and he spent ten
      years more in regretting his hastiness and criticising his successor. The
      ordinary course of life, with fine air and contented minds, was to do a
      full share of work till seventy, and then to look after &ldquo;orra&rdquo; jobs well
      into the eighties, and to &ldquo;slip awa&rsquo;&rdquo; within sight of ninety. Persons
      above ninety were understood to be acquitting themselves with credit, and
      assumed airs of authority, brushing aside the opinions of seventy as
      immature, and confirming their conclusions with illustrations drawn from
      the end of last century.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Hillocks&rsquo;s brother so far forgot himself as to &ldquo;slip awa&rsquo;&rdquo; at sixty,
      that worthy man was scandalised, and offered laboured explanations at the
      &ldquo;beerial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awfu&rsquo; business ony wy ye look at it, an&rsquo; a sair trial tae us a&rsquo;.
      A&rsquo; never heard tell of sic a thing in oor family afore, an&rsquo; it &lsquo;s no easy
      accoontin&rsquo; for &lsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gudewife was sayin&rsquo; he wes never the same sin&rsquo; a weet nicht he lost
      himsel&rsquo; on the muir and slept below a bush; but that&rsquo;s neither here nor
      there. A&rsquo; &lsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; he sappit his constitution thae twa years he wes
      grieve aboot England. That wes thirty years syne, but ye&rsquo;re never the same
      after thae foreign climates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drumtochty listened patiently to Hillocks&rsquo;s apologia, but was not
      satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clean havers aboot the muir. Losh keep&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;ve a&rsquo; sleepit oot and
      never been a hair the waur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&rsquo; admit that England micht hae dune the job; it&rsquo;s no canny stravagin&rsquo; 
      yon wy frae place tae place, but Drums never complained tae me as if he
      hed been nippit in the Sooth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The parish had, in fact, lost confidence in Drums after his wayward
      experiment with a potato-digging machine, which turned out a lamentable
      failure, and his premature departure confirmed our vague impression of his
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s awa&rsquo; noo,&rdquo; Drumsheugh summed up, after opinion had time to form;
      &ldquo;an&rsquo; there were waur fouk than Drums, but there&rsquo;s nae doot he wes a wee
      flichty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When illness had the audacity to attack a Drumtochty man, it was described
      as a &ldquo;whup,&rdquo; and was treated by the men with a fine negligence. Hillocks
      was sitting in the post-office one afternoon when I looked in for my
      letters, and the right side of his face was blazing red. His subject of
      discourse was the prospects of the turnip &ldquo;breer,&rdquo; but he casually
      explained that he was waiting for medical advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gudewife is keepin&rsquo; up a ding-dong frae mornin&rsquo; till nicht aboot ma
      face, and a&rsquo; &lsquo;m fair deaved (deafened), so a&rsquo; &lsquo;m watchin&rsquo; for MacLure tae
      get a bottle as he comes wast; yon&rsquo;s him noo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor made his diagnosis from horseback on sight, and stated the
      result with that admirable clearness which endeared him to Drumtochty:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound ye, Hillocks, what are ye ploiterin&rsquo; aboot here for in the weet
      wi&rsquo; a face like a boiled beer? Div ye no ken that ye&rsquo;ve a tetch o&rsquo; the
      rose (erysipelas), and ocht tae be in the hoose? Gae hame wi&rsquo; ye afore a&rsquo; 
      leave the bit, and send a halflin&rsquo; for some medicine. Ye donnerd idiot,
      are ye ettlin tae follow Drums afore yir time?&rdquo; And the medical attendant
      of Drumtochty continued his invective till Hillocks started, and still
      pursued his retreating figure with medical directions of a simple and
      practical character:
    </p>

      &ldquo;A&rsquo; &lsquo;m watchin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; peety ye if ye pit aff time. Keep yir bed the
      mornin&rsquo;, and dinna show yir face in the fields till a&rsquo; see ye. A&rsquo;ll gie ye
      a cry on Monday,&mdash;sic an auld fule,&mdash;but there&rsquo;s no ane o&rsquo; them
      tae mind anither in the hale pairish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hillocks&rsquo;s wife informed the kirkyard that the doctor &ldquo;gied the gudeman an
      awful&rsquo; clearin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and that Hillocks &ldquo;wes keepin&rsquo; the hoose,&rdquo; which meant
      that the patient had tea breakfast, and at that time was wandering about
      the farm buildings in an easy undress, with his head in a plaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible for a doctor to earn even the most modest competence
      from a people of such scandalous health, and so MacLure had annexed
      neighbouring parishes. His house&mdash;little more than a cottage&mdash;stood
      on the roadside among the pines toward the head of our Glen, and from this
      base of operations he dominated the wild glen that broke the wall of the
      Grampians above Drumtochty&mdash;where the snow-drifts were twelve feet
      deep in winter, and the only way of passage at times was the channel of
      the river&mdash;and the moorland district westward till he came to the
      Dunleith sphere of influence, where there were four doctors and a
      hydropathic. Drumtochty in its length, which was eight miles, and its
      breadth, which was four, lay in his hand; besides a glen behind, unknown
      to the world, which in the night-time he visited at the risk of life, for
      the way thereto was across the big moor with its peat-holes and
      treacherous bogs. And he held the land eastward toward Muirtown so far as
      Geordie. The Drumtochty post travelled every day, and could carry word
      that the doctor was wanted. He did his best for the need of every man,
      woman, and child in this wild, straggling district, year in, year out, in
      the snow and in the heat, in the dark and in the light, without rest, and
      without holiday for forty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      One horse could not do the work of this man, but we liked best to see him
      on his old white mare, who died the week after her master, and the passing
      of the two did our hearts good. It was not that he rode beautifully, for
      he broke every canon of art, flying with his arms, stooping till he seemed
      to be speaking into Jess&rsquo;s ears, and rising in the saddle beyond all
      necessity. But he could ride faster, stay longer in the saddle, and had a
      firmer grip with his knees than any one I ever met, and it was all for
      mercy&rsquo;s sake. When the reapers in harvest-time saw a figure whirling past
      in a cloud of dust, or the family at the foot of Glen Urtach, gathered
      round the fire on a winter&rsquo;s night, heard the rattle of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs on
      the road, or the shepherds, out after the sheep, traced a black speck
      moving across the snow to the upper glen, they knew it was the doctor,
      and, without being conscious of it, wished him God-speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before and behind his saddle were strapped the instruments and medicines
      the doctor might want, for he never knew what was before him. There were
      no specialists in Drumtochty, so this man had to do everything as best he
      could, and as quickly. He was chest doctor, and doctor for every other
      organ as well; he was accoucheur and surgeon; he was oculist and aurist;
      he was dentist and chloroformist, besides being chemist and druggist. It
      was often told how he was far up Glen Urtach when the feeders of the
      threshing-mill caught young Burnbrae, and how he only stopped to change
      horses at his house, and galloped all the way to Burnbrae, and flung
      himself off his horse, and amputated the arm, and saved the lad&rsquo;s life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wud hae thocht that every meenut was an hour,&rdquo; said Jamie Soutar, who
      had been at the threshing, &ldquo;an&rsquo; a&rsquo; &lsquo;ll never forget the puir lad lyin&rsquo; as
      white as deith on the floor o&rsquo; the loft, wi&rsquo; his head on a sheaf, and
      Burnbrae haudin&rsquo; the bandage ticht an&rsquo; prayin&rsquo; a&rsquo; the while, and the
      mither greetin&rsquo; in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Will he never come?&rsquo; she cries, an&rsquo; a&rsquo; heard the soond o&rsquo; the horse&rsquo;s
      feet on the road a mile awa&rsquo; in the frosty air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Lord be praised!&rsquo; said Burnbrae, and a&rsquo; slipped doon the ladder as
      the doctor came skelpin&rsquo; intae the close, the foam fleein&rsquo; frae his
      horse&rsquo;s mooth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whar is he?&rsquo; wes a&rsquo; that passed his lips, an&rsquo; in five meenuts he hed him
      on the feedin&rsquo; board, and wes at his wark&mdash;sic wark, neeburs! but he
      did it weel. An&rsquo; ae thing a&rsquo; thocht rael thochtfu&rsquo; o&rsquo; him: he first sent
      aff the laddie&rsquo;s mither tae get a bed ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Noo that&rsquo;s feenished, and his constitution &lsquo;ill dae the rest,&rsquo; and he
      carried the lad doon the ladder in his airms like a bairn, and laid him in
      his bed, and waits aside him till he wes sleepin&rsquo;, and then says he,
      &lsquo;Burnbrae, yir a gey lad never tae say, &ldquo;Collie, will ye lick?&rdquo; for a&rsquo; 
      hevna tasted meat for saxteen hoors.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was michty tae see him come intae the yaird that day, neeburs; the
      verra look o&rsquo; him wes victory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jamie&rsquo;s cynicism slipped off in the enthusiasm of this reminiscence, and
      he expressed the feeling of Drumtochty. No one sent for MacLure save in
      great straits, and the sight of him put courage in sinking hearts. But
      this was not by the grace of his appearance, or the advantage of a good
      bedside manner. A tall, gaunt, loosely made man, without an ounce of
      superfluous flesh on his body, his face burned a dark brick colour by
      constant exposure to the weather, red hair and beard turning gray, honest
      blue eyes that look you ever in the face, huge hands with wrist-bones like
      the shank of a ham, and a voice that hurled his salutations across two
      fields, he suggested the moor rather than the drawing-room. But what a
      clever hand it was in an operation&mdash;as delicate as a woman&rsquo;s! and
      what a kindly voice it was in the humble room where the shepherd&rsquo;s wife
      was weeping by her man&rsquo;s bedside! He was &ldquo;ill pitten thegither&rdquo; to begin
      with, but many of his physical defects were the penalties of his work, and
      endeared him to the Glen. That ugly scar, that cut into his right eyebrow
      and gave him such a sinister expression, was got one night Jess slipped on
      the ice and laid him insensible eight miles from home. His limp marked the
      big snowstorm in the fifties, when his horse missed the road in Glen
      Urtach, and they rolled together in a drift. MacLure escaped with a broken
      leg and the fracture of three ribs, but he never walked like other men
      again. He could not swing himself into the saddle without making two
      attempts and holding Jess&rsquo;s mane. Neither can you &ldquo;warstle&rdquo; through the
      peat-bogs and snow-drifts for forty winters without a touch of rheumatism.
      But they were honourable scars, and for such risks of life men get the
      Victoria Cross in other fields. MacLure got nothing but the secret
      affection of the Glen, which knew that none had ever done one tenth as
      much for it as this ungainly, twisted, battered figure, and I have seen a
      Drumtochty face soften at the sight of MacLure limping to his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hopps earned the ill-will of the Glen for ever by criticising the
      doctor&rsquo;s dress, but indeed it would have filled any townsman with
      amazement. Black he wore once a year, on sacrament Sunday, and, if
      possible, at a funeral; top-coat or water-proof never. His jacket and
      waistcoat were rough homespun of Glen Urtach wool, which threw off the wet
      like a duck&rsquo;s back, and below he was clad in shepherd&rsquo;s tartan trousers,
      which disappeared into unpolished riding-boots. His shirt was gray
      flannel, and he was uncertain about a collar, but certain as to a tie,&mdash;which
      he never had, his beard doing instead,&mdash;and his hat was soft felt of
      four colours and seven different shapes. His point of distinction in dress
      was the trousers, and they were the subject of unending speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some threep that he&rsquo;s worn thae eedentical pair the last twenty year, an&rsquo; 
      a mind masel&rsquo; him getting&rsquo; a tear ahint, when he was crossin&rsquo; oor palin&rsquo;,
      an the mend&rsquo;s still veesible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ithers declare &lsquo;at he&rsquo;s got a wab o&rsquo; claith, and hes a new pair made in
      Muirtown aince in the twa year maybe, and keeps them in the garden till
      the new look wears aff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For ma ain pairt,&rdquo; Soutar used to declare, &ldquo;a&rsquo; canna mak&rsquo; up my mind, but
      there&rsquo;s ae thing sure: the Glen wudna like tae see him withoot them; it
      wud be a shock tae confidence. There&rsquo;s no muckle o&rsquo; the check left, but ye
      can aye tell it, and when ye see thae breeks comin&rsquo; in ye ken that if
      human pooer can save yir bairn&rsquo;s life it &lsquo;ill be dune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The confidence of the Glen&mdash;and the tributary states&mdash;was
      unbounded, and rested partly on long experience of the doctor&rsquo;s resources,
      and partly on his hereditary connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father was here afore him,&rdquo; Mrs. Macfadyen used to explain; &ldquo;atween
      them they&rsquo;ve hed the country-side for weel on tae a century; if MacLure
      disna understand oor constitution, wha dis, a&rsquo; wud like tae ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For Drumtochty had its own constitution and a special throat disease, as
      became a parish which was quite self-contained between the woods and the
      hills, and not dependent on the lowlands either for its diseases or its
      doctors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a skilly man, Dr. MacLure,&rdquo; continued my friend Mrs. Macfadyen,
      whose judgment on sermons or anything else was seldom at fault; &ldquo;an&rsquo; a
      kind-hearted, though o&rsquo; coorse he hes his faults like us a&rsquo;, an&rsquo; he disna
      tribble the kirk often.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He aye can tell what&rsquo;s wrong wi&rsquo; a body, an&rsquo; maistly he can put ye richt,
      and there&rsquo;s nae new-fangled wys wi&rsquo; him; a blister for the ootside an&rsquo; 
      Epsom salts for the inside dis his wark, an&rsquo; they say there&rsquo;s no an herb
      on the hills he disna ken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re tae dee, we&rsquo;re tae dee; an&rsquo; if we&rsquo;re tae live, we&rsquo;re tae live,&rdquo;
       concluded Elspeth, with sound Calvinistic logic; &ldquo;but a&rsquo; &lsquo;ll say this for
      the doctor, that, whether yir tae live or dee, he can aye keep up a sharp
      meisture on the skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s no verra ceevil gin ye bring him when there&rsquo;s naethin&rsquo; wrang,&rdquo;
       and Mrs. Macfadyen&rsquo;s face reflected another of Mr. Hopps&rsquo;s misadventures
      of which Hillocks held the copyright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hopps&rsquo;s laddie ate grosarts (gooseberries) till they hed to sit up a&rsquo; 
      nicht wi&rsquo; him, an&rsquo; naethin&rsquo; wud do but they maum hae the doctor, an&rsquo; he
      writes &lsquo;immediately&rsquo; on a slip o&rsquo; paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, MacLure had been awa&rsquo; a&rsquo; nicht wi&rsquo; a shepherd&rsquo;s wife Dunleith wy,
      and he comes here withoot drawin&rsquo; bridle, mud up tae the een.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s adae here, Hillocks?&rsquo; he cries; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s no an accident, is &lsquo;t?&rsquo; and
      when he got aff his horse he cud hardly stand wi&rsquo; stiffness and tire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s nane o&rsquo; us, doctor; it&rsquo;s Hopps&rsquo;s laddie; he&rsquo;s been eatin&rsquo; ower-mony
      berries.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he didna turn on me like a tiger!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Div ye mean tae say&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Weesht, weesht,&rsquo; an&rsquo; I tried tae quiet him, for Hopps wes coomin&rsquo; oot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, doctor,&rsquo; begins he, as brisk as a magpie, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re here at last;
      there&rsquo;s no hurry with you Scotchmen. My boy has been sick all night, and
      I&rsquo;ve never had a wink of sleep. You might have come a little quicker,
      that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got to say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve mair tae dae in Drumtochty than attend tae every bairn that hes a
      sair stomach,&rsquo; and a&rsquo; saw MacLure was roosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m astonished to hear you speak. Our doctor at home always says to Mrs.
      &lsquo;Opps, &ldquo;Look on me as a family friend, Mrs. &lsquo;Opps, and send for me though
      it be only a headache.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;d be mair spairin&rsquo; o&rsquo; his offers if he hed four and twenty mile tae
      look aifter. There&rsquo;s naethin&rsquo; wrang wi&rsquo; yir laddie but greed. Gie him a
      gud dose o&rsquo; castor-oil and stop his meat for a day, an&rsquo; he &lsquo;ill be a&rsquo;richt
      the morn.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He &lsquo;ill not take castor-oil, doctor. We have given up those barbarous
      medicines.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whatna kind o&rsquo; medicines hae ye noo in the Sooth?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, you see Dr. MacLure, we&rsquo;re homoeopathists, and I&rsquo;ve my little
      chest here,&rsquo; and oot Hopps comes wi&rsquo; his boxy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s see &lsquo;t,&rsquo; an&rsquo; MacLure sits doon and tak&rsquo;s oot the bit bottles, and
      he reads the names wi&rsquo; a lauch every time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Belladonna; did ye ever hear the like? Aconite; it cowes a&rsquo;. Nux vomica.
      What next? Weel, ma mannie,&rsquo; he says tae Hopps, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a fine ploy, and ye
      &lsquo;ill better gang on wi&rsquo; the nux till it&rsquo;s dune, and gie him ony ither o&rsquo; 
      the sweeties he fancies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Noo, Hillocks, a&rsquo; maun be aff tae see Drumsheugh&rsquo;s grieve, for he&rsquo;s doon
      wi&rsquo; the fever, and it&rsquo;s tae be a teuch fecht. A&rsquo; hinna time tae wait for
      dinner; gie me some cheese an&rsquo; cake in ma haund, and Jess &lsquo;ill take a pail
      o&rsquo; meal an&rsquo; water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fee? A&rsquo; &lsquo;m no wantin&rsquo; yir fees, man; wi&rsquo; that boxy ye dinna need a
      doctor; na, na, gie yir siller tae some puir body, Maister Hopps,&rsquo; an&rsquo; he
      was doon the road as hard as he cud lick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His fees were pretty much what the folk chose to give him, and he
      collected them once a year at Kildrummie fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, doctor, what am a&rsquo; awin&rsquo; ye for the wife and bairn? Ye &lsquo;ill need
      three notes for that nicht ye stayed in the hoose an&rsquo; a&rsquo; the vessits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Havers,&rdquo; MacLure would answer, &ldquo;prices are low, a&rsquo; &lsquo;m hearin&rsquo;; gie &lsquo;s
      thirty shillin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, a&rsquo; &lsquo;ll no, or the wife &lsquo;ill tak&rsquo; ma ears aff,&rdquo; and it was settled for
      two pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Kilspindie gave him a free house and fields, and one way or other,
      Drumsheugh told me the doctor might get in about one hundred and fifty
      pounds a year, out of which he had to pay his old housekeeper&rsquo;s wages and
      a boy&rsquo;s, and keep two horses, besides the cost of instruments and books,
      which he bought through a friend in Edinburgh with much judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one man who ever complained of the doctor&rsquo;s charges, and
      that was the new farmer of Milton, who was so good that he was above both
      churches, and held a meeting in his barn. (It was Milton the Glen supposed
      at first to be a Mormon, but I can&rsquo;t go into that now.) He offered MacLure
      a pound less than he asked, and two tracts, whereupon MacLure expressed
      his opinion of Milton, both from a theological and social standpoint, with
      such vigour and frankness that an attentive audience of Drumtochty men
      could hardly contain themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jamie Soutar was selling his pig at the time, and missed the meeting, but
      he hastened to condole with Milton, who was complaining everywhere of the
      doctor&rsquo;s language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye did richt tae resist him; it &lsquo;ill maybe roose the Glen tae mak&rsquo; a
      stand; he fair hands them in bondage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty shillin&rsquo;s for twal&rsquo; vessits, and him no mair than seeven mile
      awa&rsquo;, an&rsquo; a&rsquo; &lsquo;m telt there werena mair than four at nicht.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye &lsquo;ill hae the sympathy o&rsquo; the Glen, for a&rsquo;body kens yir as free wi&rsquo; yir
      siller as yir tracts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wes &lsquo;t &lsquo;Beware o&rsquo; Gude Warks&rsquo; ye offered him? Man, ye chose it weel, for
      he&rsquo;s been colleckin&rsquo; sae mony thae forty years, a&rsquo; &lsquo;m feared for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&rsquo; &lsquo;ve often thocht oor doctor&rsquo;s little better than the Gude Samaritan,
      an&rsquo; the Pharisees didna think muckle o&rsquo; his chance aither in this warld or
      that which is tae come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      II THROUGH THE FLOOD
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. MacLure did not lead a solemn procession from the sick-bed to the
      dining-room, and give his opinion from the hearth-rug with an air of
      wisdom bordering on the supernatural, because neither the Drumtochty
      houses nor his manners were on that large scale. He was accustomed to
      deliver himself in the yard, and to conclude his directions with one foot
      in the stirrup; but when he left the room where the life of Annie Mitchell
      was ebbing slowly away, our doctor said not one word, and at the sight of
      his face her husband&rsquo;s heart was troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a dull man, Tammas, who could not read the meaning of a sign, and
      laboured under a perpetual disability of speech; but love was eyes to him
      that day, and a mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is &lsquo;t as bad as yir lookin&rsquo;, doctor? Tell &lsquo;s the truth. Wull Annie no
      come through?&rdquo; and Tammas looked MacLure straight in the face, who never
      flinched his duty or said smooth things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&rsquo; wud gie onythin&rsquo; tae say Annie has a chance, but a&rsquo; daurna; a&rsquo; doot
      yir gaein&rsquo; to lose her, Tammas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      MacLure was in the saddle, and, as he gave his judgment, he laid his hand
      on Tammas&rsquo;s shoulder with one of the rare caresses that pass between men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sair business, but ye &lsquo;ill play the man and no vex Annie; she &lsquo;ill
      dae her best, a&rsquo; &lsquo;ll warrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a&rsquo; &lsquo;ll dae mine,&rdquo; and Tammas gave MacLure&rsquo;s hand a grip that would
      have crushed the bones of a weakling. Drumtochty felt in such moments the
      brotherliness of this rough-looking man, and loved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tammas hid his face in Jess&rsquo;s mane, who looked round with sorrow in her
      beautiful eyes, for she had seen many tragedies; and in this silent
      sympathy the stricken man drank his cup, drop by drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&rsquo; wesna prepared for this, for a&rsquo; aye thocht she wud live the langest. .
      . . She&rsquo;s younger than me by ten year, and never was ill. . . . We&rsquo;ve been
      mairit twal&rsquo; year last Martinmas, but it&rsquo;s juist like a year the day. . .
      . A&rsquo; wes never worthy o&rsquo; her, the bonniest, snoddest (neatest), kindliest
      lass in the Glen. . . . A&rsquo; never cud mak&rsquo; oot hoo she ever lookit at me,
      &lsquo;at hesna hed ae word tae say about her till it&rsquo;s ower-late. . . . She
      didna cuist up to me that a&rsquo; wesna worthy o&rsquo; her&mdash;no her; but aye she
      said, &lsquo;Yir ma ain gudeman, and nane cud be kinder tae me.&rsquo; . . . An&rsquo; a&rsquo; 
      wes minded tae be kind, but a&rsquo; see noo mony little trokes a&rsquo; micht hae
      dune for her, and noo the time is by. . . . Naebody kens hoo patient she
      wes wi&rsquo; me, and aye made the best o&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; never pit me tae shame afore
      the fouk. . . . An&rsquo; we never hed ae cross word, no ane in twal&rsquo; year. . .
      . We were mair nor man and wife&mdash;we were sweethearts a&rsquo; the time. . .
      . Oh, ma bonnie lass, what &lsquo;ill the bairnies an&rsquo; me dae without ye,
      Annie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The winter night was falling fast, the snow lay deep upon the ground, and
      the merciless north wind moaned through the close as Tammas wrestled with
      his sorrow dry-eyed, for tears were denied Drumtochty men. Neither the
      doctor nor Jess moved hand or foot, but their hearts were with their
      fellow-creature, and at length the doctor made a sign to Marget Howe, who
      had come out in search of Tammas, and now stood by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinna mourn tae the brakin&rsquo; o&rsquo; yir hert, Tammas,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as if Annie
      an&rsquo; you hed never luved. Neither death nor time can pairt them that luve;
      there&rsquo;s naethin&rsquo; in a&rsquo; the warld sae strong as luve. If Annie gaes frae
      the sicht o&rsquo; yir een she &lsquo;ill come the nearer tae yir hert. She wants tae
      see ye, and tae hear ye say that ye &lsquo;ill never forget her nicht nor day
      till ye meet in the land where there&rsquo;s nae pairtin&rsquo;. Oh, a&rsquo; ken what a&rsquo; &lsquo;m
      sayin&rsquo;, for it&rsquo;s five year noo sin&rsquo; George gied awa&rsquo;, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s mair wi me
      noo than when he was in Edinboro&rsquo; and I wes in Drumtochty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank ye kindly, Marget; thae are gude words an&rsquo; true, an&rsquo; ye hev the
      richt tae say them; but a&rsquo; canna dae without seein&rsquo; Annie comin&rsquo; tae meet
      me in the gloamin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; gaein&rsquo; in an&rsquo; oot the hoose, an&rsquo; hearin&rsquo; her ca&rsquo; 
      me by ma name; an&rsquo; a&rsquo; &lsquo;ll no can tell her that a&rsquo; luve her when there&rsquo;s
      nae Annie in the hoose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can naethin&rsquo; be dune, doctor? Ye savit Flora Cammil, and young Burnbrae,
      an&rsquo; yon shepherd&rsquo;s wife Dunleith wy; an&rsquo; we were a&rsquo; sae prood o&rsquo; ye, an&rsquo; 
      pleased tae think that ye hed keepit deith frae anither hame. Can ye no
      think o&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; tae help Annie, and gie her back her man and bairnies?&rdquo;
       and Tammas searched the doctor&rsquo;s face in the cold, weird light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nae pooer in heaven or airth like luve,&rdquo; Marget said to me
      afterward; &ldquo;it mak&rsquo;s the weak strong and the dumb tae speak. Oor herts
      were as water afore Tammas&rsquo;s words, an&rsquo; a&rsquo; saw the doctor shake in his
      saddle. A&rsquo; never kent till that meenut hoo he hed a share in a&rsquo;body&rsquo;s
      grief, an&rsquo; carried the heaviest wecht o&rsquo; a&rsquo; the Glen. A&rsquo; peetied him wi&rsquo; 
      Tammas lookin&rsquo; at him sae wistfully, as if he hed the keys o&rsquo; life an&rsquo; 
      deith in his hands. But he wes honest, and wudna hold oot a false houp tae
      deceive a sore hert or win escape for himsel&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye needna plead wi&rsquo; me, Tammas, to dae the best a&rsquo; can for yir wife. Man,
      a&rsquo; kent her lang afore ye ever luved her; a&rsquo; brocht her intae the warld,
      and a&rsquo; saw her through the fever when she wes a bit lassikie; a&rsquo; closed
      her mither&rsquo;s een, and it wes me hed tae tell her she wes an orphan; an&rsquo; 
      nae man wes better pleased when she got a gude husband, and a&rsquo; helpit her
      wi&rsquo; her fower bairns. A&rsquo; &lsquo;ve naither wife nor bairns o&rsquo; ma own, an&rsquo; a&rsquo; 
      coont a&rsquo; the fouk o&rsquo; the Glen ma family. Div ye think a&rsquo; wudna save Annie
      if I cud? If there wes a man in Muirtown &lsquo;at cud dae mair for her, a&rsquo; &lsquo;d
      have him this verra nicht; but a&rsquo; the doctors in Perthshire are helpless
      for this tribble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tammas, ma puir fallow, if it could avail, a&rsquo; tell ye a&rsquo; wud lay doon
      this auld worn-oot ruckle o&rsquo; a body o&rsquo; mine juist tae see ye baith sittin&rsquo; 
      at the fireside, an&rsquo; the bairns round ye, couthy an&rsquo; canty again; but it&rsquo;s
      nae tae be, Tammas, it&rsquo;s nae tae be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a&rsquo; lookit at the doctor&rsquo;s face,&rdquo; Marget said, &ldquo;a&rsquo; thocht him the
      winsomest man a&rsquo; ever saw. He wes transfigured that nicht, for a&rsquo; &lsquo;m
      judgin&rsquo; there&rsquo;s nae transfiguration like luve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s wull an&rsquo; maun be borne, but it&rsquo;s a sair wull fur me, an&rsquo; a&rsquo; &lsquo;m
      no ungratefu&rsquo; tae you, doctor, for a&rsquo; ye&rsquo;ve dune and what ye said the
      nicht,&rdquo; and Tammas went back to sit with Annie for the last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess picked her way through the deep snow to the main road, with a skill
      that came of long experience, and the doctor held converse with her
      according to his wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, Jess, wumman, yon wes the hardest wark a&rsquo; hae tae face, and a&rsquo; wud
      raither hae taen ma chance o&rsquo; anither row in a Glen Urtach drift than tell
      Tammas Mitchell his wife wes deein&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&rsquo; said she cudna be cured, and it was true, for there&rsquo;s juist ae man in
      the land fit for &lsquo;t, and they micht as weel try tae get the mune oot o&rsquo; 
      heaven. Sae a&rsquo; said naethin&rsquo; tae vex Tammas&rsquo;s hert, for it&rsquo;s heavy eneuch
      withoot regrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s hard, Jess, that money will buy life after a&rsquo;, an&rsquo; if Annie wes
      a duchess her man wudna lose her; but bein&rsquo; only a puir cotter&rsquo;s wife, she
      maun dee afore the week &lsquo;s oot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gin we hed him the morn there&rsquo;s little doot she wud be saved, for he
      hesna lost mair than five per cent. o&rsquo; his cases, and they &lsquo;ill be puir
      toons-craturs, no strappin&rsquo; women like Annie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s oot o&rsquo; the question, Jess, sae hurry up, lass, for we&rsquo;ve hed a heavy
      day. But it wud be the grandest thing that wes ever done in the Glen in
      oor time if it could be managed by hook or crook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll gang and see Drumsheugh, Jess; he&rsquo;s anither man sin&rsquo; Geordie Hoo&rsquo;s
      deith, and he was aye kinder than fouk kent.&rdquo; And the doctor passed at a
      gallop through the village, whose lights shone across the white
      frost-bound road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in by, doctor; a&rsquo; heard ye on the road; ye &lsquo;ill hae been at Tammas
      Mitchell&rsquo;s; hoo&rsquo;s the gudewife? A&rsquo; doot she&rsquo;s sober.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annie&rsquo;s deein&rsquo;, Drumsheugh, an&rsquo; Tammas is like tae brak his hert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no lichtsome, doctor, no lichtsome, ava, for a&rsquo; dinna ken ony man
      in Drumtochty sae bund up in his wife as Tammas, and there&rsquo;s no a bonnier
      wumman o&rsquo; her age crosses oor kirk door than Annie, nor a cleverer at her
      work. Man ye &lsquo;ill need tae pit yir brains in steep. Is she clean beyond
      ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beyond me and every ither in the land but ane, and it wud cost a hundred
      guineas tae bring him tae Drumtochty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certes, he&rsquo;s no blate; it&rsquo;s a fell chairge for a short day&rsquo;s work; but
      hundred or no hundred we &lsquo;ill hae him, and no let Annie gang, and her no
      half her years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are ye meanin&rsquo; it, Drumsheugh?&rdquo; and MacLure turned white below the tan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William MacLure,&rdquo; said Drumsheugh, in one of the few confidences that
      ever broke the Drumtochty reserve, &ldquo;a&rsquo; &lsquo;m a lonely man, wi&rsquo; naebody o&rsquo; ma
      ain blude tae care for me livin&rsquo;, or tae lift me intae ma coffin when a&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;m deid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&rsquo; fecht awa&rsquo; at Muirtown market for an extra pund on a beast, or a
      shillin&rsquo; on the quarter o&rsquo; barley, an&rsquo; what&rsquo;s the gude o&rsquo; &lsquo;t? Burnbrae
      gaes aff tae get a goon for his wife or a buke for his college laddie, an&rsquo; 
      Lachlan Campbell &lsquo;ill no leave the place noo without a ribbon for Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ilka man in the Kildrummie train has some bit fairin&rsquo; in his pooch for
      the fouk at hame that he&rsquo;s bocht wi&rsquo; the siller he won.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s naebody tae be lookin&rsquo; oot for me, an&rsquo; comin&rsquo; doon the road
      tae meet me, and daffin&rsquo; (joking) wi&rsquo; me aboot their fairin&rsquo;, or feelin&rsquo; 
      ma pockets. Ou, ay! A&rsquo; &lsquo;ve seen it a&rsquo; at ither hooses, though they tried
      tae hide it frae me for fear a&rsquo; wud lauch at them. Me lauch, wi&rsquo; ma cauld,
      empty hame!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yir the only man kens, Weelum, that I aince luved the noblest wumman in
      the Glen or onywhere, an&rsquo; a&rsquo; luve her still, but wi&rsquo; anither luve noo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hed given her hert tae anither, or a&rsquo; &lsquo;ve thocht a&rsquo; micht hae won
      her, though nae man be worthy o&rsquo; sic a gift. Ma hert turned tae
      bitterness, but that passed awa&rsquo; beside the brier-bush what George Hoo lay
      yon sad simmer-time. Some day a&rsquo; &lsquo;ll tell ye ma story, Weelum, for you an&rsquo; 
      me are auld freends, and will be till we dee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      MacLure felt beneath the table for Drumsheugh&rsquo;s hand, but neither man
      looked at the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, a&rsquo; we can dae noo, Weelum, gin we haena mickle brightness in oor
      ain hames, is tae keep the licht frae gaein&rsquo; oot in anither hoose. Write
      the telegram, man, and Sandy &lsquo;ill send it aff frae Kildrummie this verra
      nicht, and ye &lsquo;ill hae yir man the morn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yir the man a&rsquo; coonted ye, Drumsheugh, but ye &lsquo;ill grant me a favour. Ye
      &lsquo;ill lat me pay the half, bit by bit. A&rsquo; ken yir wullin&rsquo; tae dae &lsquo;t a&rsquo;;
      but a&rsquo; haena mony pleasures, an&rsquo; a&rsquo; wud like tae hae ma ain share in
      savin&rsquo; Annie&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next morning a figure received Sir George on the Kildrummie platform, whom
      that famous surgeon took for a gillie, but who introduced himself as
      &ldquo;MacLure of Drumtochty.&rdquo; It seemed as if the East had come to meet the
      West when these two stood together, the one in travelling furs, handsome
      and distinguished, with his strong, cultured face and carriage of
      authority, a characteristic type of his profession; and the other more
      marvellously dressed than ever, for Drumsheugh&rsquo;s top-coat had been forced
      upon him for the occasion, his face and neck one redness with the bitter
      cold, rough and ungainly, yet not without some signs of power in his eye
      and voice, the most heroic type of his noble profession. MacLure compassed
      the precious arrival with observances till he was securely seated in
      Drumsheugh&rsquo;s dog-cart,&mdash;a vehicle that lent itself to history,&mdash;with
      two full-sized plaids added to his equipment&mdash;Drumsheugh and Hillocks
      had both been requisitioned; and MacLure wrapped another plaid round a
      leather case, which was placed below the seat with such reverence as might
      be given to the Queen&rsquo;s regalia. Peter attended their departure full of
      interest, and as soon as they were in the fir woods MacLure explained that
      it would be an eventful journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a&rsquo;richt in here, for the wind disna get at the snow; but the drifts
      are deep in the Glen, and th&rsquo; &lsquo;ill be some engineerin&rsquo; afore we get tae
      oor destination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Four times they left the road and took their way over fields; twice they
      forced a passage through a slap in a dyke; thrice they used gaps in the
      paling which MacLure had made on his downward journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&rsquo; seleckit the road this mornin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; a&rsquo; ken the depth tae an inch; we
      &lsquo;ill get through this steadin&rsquo; here tae the main road, but our worst job
      &lsquo;ill be crossin&rsquo; the Tochty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see, the bridge hes been shakin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; this winter&rsquo;s flood, and we
      daurna venture on it, sae we hev tae ford, and the snaw&rsquo;s been meltin&rsquo; up
      Urtach way. There&rsquo;s nae doot the water&rsquo;s gey big, and it&rsquo;s threatenin&rsquo; tae
      rise, but we &lsquo;ill win through wi&rsquo; a warstle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It micht be safer tae lift the instruments oot o&rsquo; reach o&rsquo; the water; wud
      ye mind haddin&rsquo; them on yir knee till we&rsquo;re ower, an&rsquo; keep firm in yir
      seat in case we come on a stane in the bed o&rsquo; the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time they had come to the edge, and it was not a cheering sight.
      The Tochty had spread out over the meadows, and while they waited they
      could see it cover another two inches on the trunk of a tree. There are
      summer floods, when the water is brown and flecked with foam, but this was
      a winter flood, which is black and sullen, and runs in the centre with a
      strong, fierce, silent current. Upon the opposite side Hillocks stood to
      give directions by word and hand, as the ford was on his land, and none
      knew the Tochty better in all its ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed through the shallow water without mishap, save when the wheel
      struck a hidden stone or fell suddenly into a rut; but when they neared
      the body of the river MacLure halted, to give Jess a minute&rsquo;s breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It &lsquo;ill tak&rsquo; ye a&rsquo; yir time, lass, an&rsquo; a&rsquo; wud raither be on yir back; but
      ye never failed me yet, and a wumman&rsquo;s life is hangin&rsquo; on the crossin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the first plunge into the bed of the stream the water rose to the
      axles, and then it crept up to the shafts, so that the surgeon could feel
      it lapping in about his feet, while the dog-cart began to quiver, and it
      seemed as if it were to be carried away. Sir George was as brave as most
      men, but he had never forded a Highland river in flood, and the mass of
      black water racing past beneath, before, behind him, affected his
      imagination and shook his nerves. He rose from his seat and ordered
      MacLure to turn back, declaring that he would be condemned utterly and
      eternally if he allowed himself to be drowned for any person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit doon!&rdquo; thundered MacLure. &ldquo;Condemned ye will be, suner or later, gin
      ye shirk yir duty, but through the water ye gang the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both men spoke much more strongly and shortly, but this is what they
      intended to say, and it was MacLure that prevailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jess trailed her feet along the ground with cunning art, and held her
      shoulder against the stream; MacLure leaned forward in his seat, a rein in
      each hand, and his eyes fixed on Hillocks, who was now standing up to the
      waist in the water, shouting directions and cheering on horse and driver:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haud tae the richt, doctor; there&rsquo;s a hole yonder. Keep oot o&rsquo; &lsquo;t for ony
      sake. That&rsquo;s it; yir daein&rsquo; fine. Steady, man, steady. Yir at the deepest;
      sit heavy in yir seats. Up the channel noo, and ye &lsquo;ill be oot o&rsquo; the
      swirl. Weel dune, Jess! Weel dune, auld mare! Mak&rsquo; straicht for me,
      doctor, an&rsquo; a&rsquo; &lsquo;ll gie ye the road oot. Ma word, ye&rsquo;ve dune yir best,
      baith o&rsquo; ye, this mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; cried Hillocks, splashing up to the dog-cart,
      now in the shallows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sall, it wes titch an&rsquo; go for a meenut in the middle; a Hielan&rsquo; ford is a
      kittle (hazardous) road in the snaw-time, but ye &lsquo;re safe noo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gude luck tae ye up at Westerton, sir; nane but a richt-hearted man wud
      hae riskit the Tochty in flood. Ye &lsquo;re boond tae succeed aifter sic a
      graund beginnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; for it had spread already that a famous surgeon had
      come to do his best for Annie, Tammas Mitchell&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later MacLure came out from Annie&rsquo;s room and laid hold of
      Tammas, a heap of speechless misery by the kitchen fire, and carried him
      off to the barn, and spread some corn on the threshing-floor, and thrust a
      flail into his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noo we &lsquo;ve tae begin, an&rsquo; we &lsquo;ill no be dune for an&rsquo; &lsquo;oor, and ye &lsquo;ve tae
      lay on without stoppin&rsquo; till a&rsquo; come for ye; an&rsquo; a&rsquo; &lsquo;ll shut the door tae
      haud in the noise, an&rsquo; keep yir dog beside ye, for there maunna be a cheep
      aboot the house for Annie&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&rsquo; &lsquo;ll dae onythin&rsquo; ye want me, but if&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&rsquo; &lsquo;ll come for ye, Tammas, gin there be danger; but what are ye feard
      for wi&rsquo; the Queen&rsquo;s ain surgeon here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fifty minutes did the flair rise and fall, save twice, when Tammas crept
      to the door and listened, the dog lifting his head and whining.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed twelve hours instead of one when the door swung back, and
      MacLure filled the doorway, preceded by a great burst of light, for the
      sun had arisen on the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face was as tidings of great joy, and Elspeth told me that there was
      nothing like it to be seen that afternoon for glory, save the sun itself
      in the heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&rsquo; never saw the marrow o&rsquo; &lsquo;t, Tammas, an&rsquo; a&rsquo; &lsquo;ll never see the like
      again; it&rsquo;s a&rsquo; ower, man, withoot a hitch frae beginnin&rsquo; tae end, and
      she&rsquo;s fa&rsquo;in&rsquo; asleep as fine as ye like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dis he think Annie&mdash;&lsquo;ill live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he dis, and be aboot the hoose inside a month; that&rsquo;s the gude
      o&rsquo; bein&rsquo; a clean-bluided, weel-livin&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Preserve ye, man, what&rsquo;s wrang wi&rsquo; ye? It&rsquo;s a mercy a&rsquo; keppit ye, or we
      wud hev hed anither job for Sir George.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye &lsquo;re a&rsquo;richt noo; sit doon on the strae. A&rsquo; &lsquo;ll come back in a while,
      an&rsquo; ye &lsquo;ill see Annie, juist for a meenut, but ye maunna say a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marget took him in and let him kneel by Annie&rsquo;s bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing then or afterward for speech came only once in his
      lifetime to Tammas, but Annie whispered, &ldquo;Ma ain dear man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the doctor placed the precious bag beside Sir George in our solitary
      first next morning, he laid a check beside it and was about to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said the great man. &ldquo;Mrs. Macfadyen and I were on the gossip
      last night, and I know the whole story about you and your friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have some right to call me a coward, but I &lsquo;ll never let you count me
      a mean, miserly rascal,&rdquo; and the check with Drumsheugh&rsquo;s painful writing
      fell in fifty pieces on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the train began to move, a voice from the first called so that all the
      station heard:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give &lsquo;s another shake of your hand, MacLure; I&rsquo;m proud to have met you;
      your are an honour to our profession. Mind the antiseptic dressings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was market-day, but only Jamie Soutar and Hillocks had ventured down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did ye hear yon, Hillocks? Hoo dae ye feel? A&rsquo; &lsquo;ll no deny a&rsquo; &lsquo;m lifted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half-way to the Junction Hillocks had recovered, and began to grasp the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell &lsquo;us what he said. A&rsquo; wud like to hae it exact for Drumsheugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thae&rsquo;s the eedentical words, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;re true; there&rsquo;s no a man in
      Drumtochty disna ken that, except ane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; wha&rsquo;s that Jamie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Weelum MacLure himsel&rsquo;. Man, a&rsquo; &lsquo;ve often girned that he sud fecht

    <h2>
      WANDERING WILLIE&rsquo;S TALE, By Sir Walter Scott
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest folks like me! How do ye ken whether I am honest, or what I am? I
      may be the deevil himsell for what ye ken, for he has power to come
      disguised like an angel of light; and, besides, he is a prime fiddler. He
      played a sonata to Corelli, ye ken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something odd in this speech, and the tone in which it was said.
      It seemed as if my companion was not always in his constant mind, or that
      he was willing to try if he could frighten me. I laughed at the
      extravagance of his language, however, and asked him in reply if he was
      fool enough to believe that the foul fiend would play so silly a
      masquerade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye ken little about it&mdash;little about it,&rdquo; said the old man, shaking
      his head and beard, and knitting his brows. &ldquo;I could tell ye something
      about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What his wife mentioned of his being a tale-teller as well as a musician
      now occurred to me; and as, you know, I like tales of superstition, I
      begged to have a specimen of his talent as we went along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very true,&rdquo; said the blind man, &ldquo;that when I am tired of scraping
      thairm or singing ballants I whiles make a tale serve the turn among the
      country bodies; and I have some fearsome anes, that make the auld carlines
      shake on the settle, and the bits o&rsquo; bairns skirl on their minnies out
      frae their beds. But this that I am going to tell you was a thing that
      befell in our ain house in my father&rsquo;s time&mdash;that is, my father was
      then a hafflins callant; and I tell it to you, that it may be a lesson to
      you that are but a young thoughtless chap, wha ye draw up wi&rsquo; on a lonely
      road; for muckle was the dool and care that came o&rsquo; &lsquo;t to my gudesire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He commenced his tale accordingly, in a distinct narrative tone of voice,
      which he raised and depressed with considerable skill; at times sinking
      almost into a whisper, and turning his clear but sightless eyeballs upon
      my face, as if it had been possible for him to witness the impression
      which his narrative made upon my features. I will not spare a syllable of
      it, although it be of the longest; so I make a dash&mdash;and begin:
    </p>
    <p>
      Ye maun have heard of Sir Robert Redgauntlet of that ilk, who lived in
      these parts before the dear years. The country will lang mind him; and our
      fathers used to draw breath thick if ever they heard him named. He was out
      wi&rsquo; the Hielandmen in Montrose&rsquo;s time; and again he was in the hills wi&rsquo; 
      Glencairn in the saxteen hundred and fifty-twa; and sae when King Charles
      the Second came in, wha was in sic favour as the laird of Redgauntlet? He
      was knighted at Lonon Court, wi&rsquo; the king&rsquo;s ain sword; and being a red-hot
      prelatist, he came down here, rampauging like a lion, with commission of
      lieutenancy (and of lunacy, for what I ken), to put down a&rsquo; the Whigs and
      Covenanters in the country. Wild wark they made of it; for the Whigs were
      as dour as the Cavaliers were fierce, and it was which should first tire
      the other. Redgauntlet was aye for the strong hand; and his name is kend
      as wide in the country as Claverhouse&rsquo;s or Tam Dalyell&rsquo;s. Glen, nor
      dargle, nor mountain, nor cave could hide the puir hill-folk when
      Redgauntlet was out with bugle and bloodhound after them, as if they had
      been sae mony deer. And, troth, when they fand them, they didna make
      muckle mair ceremony than a Hielandman wi&rsquo; a roebuck. It was just, &ldquo;Will
      ye tak&rsquo; the test?&rdquo; If not&mdash;&ldquo;Make ready&mdash;present&mdash;fire!&rdquo; and
      there lay the recusant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far and wide was Sir Robert hated and feared. Men thought he had a direct
      compact with Satan; that he was proof against steel, and that bullets
      happed aff his buff-coat like hailstanes from a hearth; that he had a mear
      that would turn a hare on the side of Carrifra-gauns (a precipitous side
      of a mountain in Moffatdale); and muckle to the same purpose, of whilk
      mair anon. The best blessing they wared on him was, &ldquo;Deil scowp wi&rsquo; 
      Redgauntlet!&rdquo; He wasna a bad master to his ain folk, though, and was weel
      aneugh liked by his tenants; and as for the lackeys and troopers that rade
      out wi&rsquo; him to the persecutions, as the Whigs caa&rsquo;d those killing-times,
      they wad hae drunken themsells blind to his health at ony time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you are to ken that my gudesire lived on Redgauntlet&rsquo;s grund&mdash;they
      ca&rsquo; the place Primrose Knowe. We had lived on the grund, and under the
      Redgauntlets, since the riding-days, and lang before. It was a pleasant
      bit; and, I think the air is callerer and fresher there than onywhere else
      in the country. It&rsquo;s a&rsquo; deserted now; and I sat on the broken door-cheek
      three days since, and was glad I couldna see the plight the place was in&mdash;but
      that&rsquo;s a&rsquo; wide o&rsquo; the mark. There dwelt my gudesire, Steenie Steenson; a
      rambling, rattling chiel&rsquo; he had been in his young days, and could play
      weel on the pipes; he was famous at &ldquo;hoopers and girders,&rdquo; a&rsquo; Cumberland
      couldna touch him at &ldquo;Jockie Lattin,&rdquo; and he had the finest finger for the
      back-lilt between Berwick and Carlisle. The like o&rsquo; Steenie wasna the sort
      that they made Whigs o&rsquo;. And so he became a Tory, as they ca&rsquo; it, which we
      now ca&rsquo; Jacobites, just out of a kind of needcessity, that he might belang
      to some side or other. He had nae ill-will to the Whig bodies, and liked
      little to see the blude rin, though, being obliged to follow Sir Robert in
      hunting and hoisting, watching and warding, he saw muckle mischief, and
      maybe did some that he couldna avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Steenie was a kind of favourite with his master, and kend a&rsquo; the folk
      about the castle, and was often sent for to play the pipes when they were
      at their merriment. Auld Dougal MacCallum, the butler, that had followed
      Sir Robert through gude and ill, thick and thin, pool and stream, was
      specially fond of the pipes, and aye gae my gudesire his gude word wi&rsquo; the
      laird; for Dougal could turn his master round his finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weel, round came the Revolution, and it had like to hae broken the hearts
      baith of Dougal and his master. But the change was not a&rsquo;thegether sae
      great as they feared and other folk thought for. The Whigs made an unco
      crawing what they wad do with their auld enemies, and in special wi&rsquo; Sir
      Robert Redgauntlet. But there were ower-mony great folks dipped in the
      same doings to make a spick-and-span new warld. So Parliament passed it a&rsquo; 
      ower easy; and Sir Robert, bating that he was held to hunting foxes
      instead of Covenanters, remained just the man he was. His revel was as
      loud, and his hall as weel lighted, as ever it had been, though maybe he
      lacked the fines of the nonconformists, that used to come to stock his
      larder and cellar; for it is certain he began to be keener about the rents
      than his tenants used to find him before, and they behooved to be prompt
      to the rent-day, or else the laird wasna pleased. And he was sic an awsome
      body that naebody cared to anger him; for the oaths he swore, and the rage
      that he used to get into, and the looks that he put on made men sometimes
      think him a devil incarnate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weel, my gudesire was nae manager&mdash;no that he was a very great
      misguider&mdash;but he hadna the saving gift, and he got twa terms&rsquo; rent
      in arrear. He got the first brash at Whitsunday put ower wi&rsquo; fair word and
      piping; but when Martinmas came there was a summons from the grund officer
      to come wi&rsquo; the rent on a day preceese, or else Steenie behooved to flit.
      Sair wark he had to get the siller; but he was weel freended, and at last
      he got the haill scraped thegether&mdash;a thousand merks. The maist of it
      was from a neighbour they caa&rsquo;d Laurie Lapraik&mdash;a sly tod. Laurie had
      wealth o&rsquo; gear, could hunt wi&rsquo; the hound and rin wi&rsquo; the hare, and be Whig
      or Tory, saunt or sinner, as the wind stood. He was a professor in the
      Revolution warld, but he liked an orra sough of the warld, and a tune on
      the pipes weel aneugh at a by-time; and, bune a&rsquo;, he thought he had gude
      security for the siller he len my gudesire ower the stocking at Primrose
      Knowe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away trots my gudesire to Redgauntlet Castle wi&rsquo; a heavy purse and a light
      heart, glad to be out of the laird&rsquo;s danger. Weel, the first thing he
      learned at the castle was that Sir Robert had fretted himsell into a fit
      of the gout because he did no appear before twelve o&rsquo;clock. It wasna
      a&rsquo;thegether for sake of the money, Dougal thought, but because he didna
      like to part wi&rsquo; my gudesire aff the grund. Dougal was glad to see
      Steenie, and brought him into the great oak parlour; and there sat the
      laird his leesome lane, excepting that he had beside him a great,
      ill-favoured jackanape that was a special pet of his. A cankered beast it
      was, and mony an ill-natured trick it played; ill to please it was, and
      easily angered&mdash;ran about the haill castle, chattering and rowling,
      and pinching and biting folk, specially before ill weather, or disturbance
      in the state. Sir Robert caa&rsquo;d it Major Weir, after the warlock that was
      burnt; and few folk liked either the name or the conditions of the
      creature&mdash;they thought there was something in it by ordinar&mdash;and
      my gudesire was not just easy in mind when the door shut on him, and he
      saw himsell in the room wi&rsquo; naebody but the laird, Dougal MacCallum, and
      the major&mdash;a thing that hadna chanced to him before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert sat, or, I should say, lay, in a great arm-chair, wi&rsquo; his grand
      velvet gown, and his feet on a cradle, for he had baith gout and gravel,
      and his face looked as gash and ghastly as Satan&rsquo;s. Major Weir sat
      opposite to him, in a red-laced coat, and the laird&rsquo;s wig on his head; and
      aye as Sir Robert girned wi&rsquo; pain, the jackanape girned too, like a
      sheep&rsquo;s head between a pair of tangs&mdash;an ill-faur&rsquo;d, fearsome couple
      they were. The laird&rsquo;s buff-coat was hung on a pin behind him and his
      broadsword and his pistols within reach; for he keepit up the auld fashion
      of having the weapons ready, and a horse saddled day and night, just as he
      used to do when he was able to loup on horseback, and sway after ony of
      the hill-folk he could get speerings of. Some said it was for fear of the
      Whigs taking vengeance, but I judge it was just his auld custom&mdash;he
      wasna gine not fear onything. The rental-book, wi&rsquo; its black cover and
      brass clasps, was lying beside him; and a book of sculduddery sangs was
      put betwixt the leaves, to keep it open at the place where it bore
      evidence against the goodman of Primrose Knowe, as behind the hand with
      his mails and duties. Sir Robert gave my gudesire a look, as if he would
      have withered his heart in his bosom. Ye maun ken he had a way of bending
      his brows that men saw the visible mark of a horseshoe in his forehead,
      deep-dinted, as if it had been stamped there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are ye come light-handed, ye son of a toom whistle?&rdquo; said Sir Robert.
      &ldquo;Zounds! If you are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My gudesire, with as gude a countenance as he could put on, made a leg,
      and placed the bag of money on the table wi&rsquo; a dash, like a man that does
      something clever. The laird drew it to him hastily. &ldquo;Is all here, Steenie,
      man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honour will find it right,&rdquo; said my gudesire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Dougal,&rdquo; said the laird, &ldquo;gie Steenie a tass of brandy, till I
      count the siller and write the receipt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But they werena weel out of the room when Sir Robert gied a yelloch that
      garr&rsquo;d the castle rock. Back ran Dougal; in flew the liverymen; yell on
      yell gied the laird, ilk ane mair awfu&rsquo; than the ither. My gudesire knew
      not whether to stand or flee, but he ventured back into the parlour, where
      a&rsquo; was gaun hirdie-girdie&mdash;naebody to say &ldquo;come in&rdquo; or &ldquo;gae out.&rdquo;
       Terribly the laird roared for cauld water to his feet, and wine to cool
      his throat; and &lsquo;Hell, hell, hell, and its flames&rsquo;, was aye the word in
      his mouth. They brought him water, and when they plunged his swoln feet
      into the tub, he cried out it was burning; and folks say that it <i>did</i>
      bubble and sparkle like a seething cauldron. He flung the cup at Dougal&rsquo;s
      head and said he had given him blood instead of Burgundy; and, sure
      aneugh, the lass washed clotted blood aff the carpet the neist day. The
      jackanape they caa&rsquo;d Major Weir, it jibbered and cried as if it was
      mocking its master. My gudesire&rsquo;s head was like to turn; he forgot baith
      siller and receipt, and downstairs he banged; but, as he ran, the shrieks
      came fainter and fainter; there was a deep-drawn shivering groan, and word
      gaed through the castle that the laird was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weel, away came my gudesire wi&rsquo; his finger in his mouth, and his best hope
      was that Dougal had seen the money-bag and heard the laird speak of
      writing the receipt. The young laird, now Sir John, came from Edinburgh to
      see things put to rights. Sir John and his father never &lsquo;greed weel. Sir
      John had been bred an advocate, and afterward sat in the last Scots
      Parliament and voted for the Union, having gotten, it was thought, a rug
      of the compensations&mdash;if his father could have come out of his grave
      he would have brained him for it on his awn hearthstane. Some thought it
      was easier counting with the auld rough knight than the fair-spoken young
      ane&mdash;but mair of that anon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dougal MacCallum, poor body, neither grat nor graned, but gaed about the
      house looking like a corpse, but directing, as was his duty, a&rsquo; the order
      of the grand funeral. Now Dougal looked aye waur and waur when night was
      coming, and was aye the last to gang to his bed, whilk was in a little
      round just opposite the chamber of dais, whilk his master occupied while
      he was living, and where he now lay in state, as they can&rsquo;d it, weeladay!
      The night before the funeral Dougal could keep his awn counsel nae longer;
      he came doun wi&rsquo; his proud spirit, and fairly asked auld Hutcheon to sit
      in his room with him for an hour. When they were in the round, Dougal took
      a tass of brandy to himsell, and gave another to Hutcheon, and wished him
      all health and lang life, and said that, for himsell, he wasna lang for
      this warld; for that every night since Sir Robert&rsquo;s death his silver call
      had sounded from the state chamber just as it used to do at nights in his
      lifetime to call Dougal to help to turn him in his bed. Dougal said that
      being alone with the dead on that floor of the tower (for naebody cared to
      wake Sir Robert Redgauntlet like another corpse), he had never daured to
      answer the call, but that now his conscience checked him for neglecting
      his duty; for, &ldquo;though death breaks service,&rdquo; said MacCallum, &ldquo;it shall
      never weak my service to Sir Robert; and I will answer his next whistle,
      so be you will stand by me, Hutcheon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hutcheon had nae will to the wark, but he had stood by Dougal in battle
      and broil, and he wad not fail him at this pinch; so doun the carles sat
      ower a stoup of brandy, and Hutcheon, who was something of a clerk, would
      have read a chapter of the Bible; but Dougal would hear naething but a
      blaud of Davie Lindsay, whilk was the waur preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When midnight came, and the house was quiet as the grave, sure enough the
      silver whistle sounded as sharp and shrill as if Sir Robert was blowing
      it; and up got the twa auld serving-men, and tottered into the room where
      the dead man lay. Hutcheon saw aneugh at the first glance; for there were
      torches in the room, which showed him the foul fiend, in his ain shape,
      sitting on the laird&rsquo;s coffin! Ower he couped as if he had been dead. He
      could not tell how lang he lay in a trance at the door, but when he
      gathered himsell he cried on his neighbour, and getting nae answer raised
      the house, when Dougal was found lying dead within twa steps of the bed
      where his master&rsquo;s coffin was placed. As for the whistle, it was gane anes
      and aye; but mony a time was it heard at the top of the house on the
      bartizan, and amang the auld chimneys and turrets where the howlets have
      their nests. Sir John hushed the matter up, and the funeral passed over
      without mair bogie wark.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when a&rsquo; was ower, and the laird was beginning to settle his affairs,
      every tenant was called up for his arrears, and my gudesire for the full
      sum that stood against him in the rental-book. Weel, away he trots to the
      castle to tell his story, and there he is introduced to Sir John, sitting
      in his father&rsquo;s chair, in deep mourning, with weepers and hanging cravat,
      and a small walking-rapier by his side, instead of the auld broadsword
      that had a hunderweight of steel about it, what with blade, chape, and
      basket-hilt. I have heard their communings so often tauld ower that I
      almost think I was there mysell, though I couldna be born at the time. (In
      fact, Alan, my companion, mimicked, with a good deal of humour, the
      flattering, conciliating tone of the tenant&rsquo;s address and the hypocritical
      melancholy of the laird&rsquo;s reply. His grandfather, he said, had while he
      spoke, his eye fixed on the rental-book, as if it were a mastiff-dog that
      he was afraid would spring up and bite him.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wuss ye joy, sir, of the head seat and the white loaf and the brid
      lairdship. Your father was a kind man to freends and followers; muckle
      grace to you, Sir John, to fill his shoon&mdash;his boots, I suld say, for
      he seldom wore shoon, unless it were muils when he had the gout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, Steenie,&rdquo; quoth the laird, sighing deeply, and putting his napkin to
      his een, &ldquo;his was a sudden call, and he will be missed in the country; no
      time to set his house in order&mdash;weel prepared Godward, no doubt,
      which is the root of the matter; but left us behind a tangled hesp to
      wind, Steenie. Hem! Hem! We maun go to business, Steenie; much to do, and
      little time to do it in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he opened the fatal volume. I have heard of a thing they call
      Doomsday book&mdash;I am clear it has been a rental of back-ganging
      tenants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen,&rdquo; said Sir John, still in the same soft, sleekit tone of voice&mdash;&ldquo;Stephen
      Stevenson, or Steenson, ye are down here for a year&rsquo;s rent behind the hand&mdash;due
      at last term.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Stephen.</i> Please your honour, Sir John, I paid it to your father.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir John.</i> Ye took a receipt, then, doubtless, Stephen, and can
      produce it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Stephen.</i> Indeed, I hadna time, an it like your honour; for nae
      sooner had I set doun the siller, and just as his honour, Sir Robert,
      that&rsquo;s gaen, drew it ill him to count it and write out the receipt, he was
      ta&rsquo;en wi&rsquo; the pains that removed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was unlucky,&rdquo; said Sir John, after a pause. &ldquo;But ye maybe paid it in
      the presence of somebody. I want but a <i>talis qualis</i> evidence,
      Stephen. I would go ower-strictly to work with no poor man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Stephen.</i> Troth, Sir John, there was naebody in the room but Dougal
      MacCallum, the butler. But, as your honour kens, he has e&rsquo;en followed his
      auld master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very unlucky again, Stephen,&rdquo; said Sir John, without altering his voice a
      single note. &ldquo;The man to whom ye paid the money is dead, and the man who
      witnessed the payment is dead too; and the siller, which should have been
      to the fore, is neither seen nor heard tell of in the repositories. How am
      I to believe a&rsquo; this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Stephen.</i> I dinna ken, your honour; but there is a bit memorandum
      note of the very coins, for, God help me! I had to borrow out of twenty
      purses; and I am sure that ilka man there set down will take his grit oath
      for what purpose I borrowed the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir John.</i> I have little doubt ye <i>borrowed</i> the money,
      Steenie. It is the <i>payment</i> that I want to have proof of.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Stephen.</i> The siller maun be about the house, Sir John. And since
      your honour never got it, and his honour that was canna have ta&rsquo;en it wi&rsquo; 
      him, maybe some of the family may hae seen it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir John.</i> We will examine the servants, Stephen; that is but
      reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But lackey and lass, and page and groom, all denied stoutly that they had
      ever seen such a bag of money as my gudesire described. What saw waur, he
      had unluckily not mentioned to any living soul of them his purpose of
      paying his rent. Ae quean had noticed something under his arm, but she
      took it for the pipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John Redgauntlet ordered the servants out of the room and then said to
      my gudesire, &ldquo;Now, Steenie, ye see ye have fair play; and, as I have
      little doubt ye ken better where to find the siller than ony other body, I
      beg in fair terms, and for your own sake, that you will end this fasherie;
      for, Stephen, ye maun pay or flit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord forgie your opinion,&rdquo; said Stephen, driven almost to his wits&rsquo; 
      end&mdash;&ldquo;I am an honest man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I, Stephen,&rdquo; said his honour; &ldquo;and so are all the folks in the
      house, I hope. But if there be a knave among us, it must be he that tells
      the story he cannot prove.&rdquo; He paused, and then added, mair sternly: &ldquo;If I
      understand your trick, sir, you want to take advantage of some malicious
      reports concerning things in this family, and particularly respecting my
      father&rsquo;s sudden death, thereby to cheat me out of the money, and perhaps
      take away my character by insinuating that I have received the rent I am
      demanding. Where do you suppose the money to be? I insist upon knowing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My gudesire saw everything look so muckle against him that he grew nearly
      desperate. However, he shifted from one foot to another, looked to every
      corner of the room, and made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak out, sirrah,&rdquo; said the laird, assuming a look of his father&rsquo;s, a
      very particular ane, which he had when he was angry&mdash;it seemed as if
      the wrinkles of his frown made that selfsame fearful shape of a horse&rsquo;s
      shoe in the middle of his brow; &ldquo;speak out, sir! I <i>will</i> know your
      thoughts; do you suppose that I have this money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far be it frae me to say so,&rdquo; said Stephen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you charge any of my people with having taken it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wad be laith to charge them that may be innocent,&rdquo; said my gudesire;
      &ldquo;and if there be any one that is guilty, I have nae proof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhere the money must be, if there is a word of truth in your story,&rdquo;
       said Sir John; &ldquo;I ask where you think it is&mdash;and demand a correct
      answer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In hell, if you <i>will</i> have my thoughts of it,&rdquo; said my gudesire,
      driven to extremity&mdash;&ldquo;in hell! with your father, his jackanape, and
      his silver whistle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down the stairs he ran (for the parlour was nae place for him after such a
      word), and he heard the laird swearing blood and wounds behind him, as
      fast as ever did Sir Robert, and roaring for the bailie and the
      baron-officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away rode my gudesire to his chief creditor (him they caa&rsquo;d Laurie
      Lapraik), to try if he could make onything out of him; but when he tauld
      his story, he got the worst word in his wame&mdash;thief, beggar, and
      dyvour were the saftest terms; and to the boot of these hard terms, Laurie
      brought up the auld story of dipping his hand in the blood of God&rsquo;s
      saunts, just as if a tenant could have helped riding with the laird, and
      that a laird like Sir Robert Redgauntlet. My gudesire was, by this time,
      far beyond the bounds of patience, and, while he and Laurie were at deil
      speed the liars, he was wanchancie aneugh to abuse Lapraik&rsquo;s doctrine as
      weel as the man, and said things that garr&rsquo;d folks&rsquo; flesh grue that heard
      them&mdash;he wasna just himsell, and he had lived wi&rsquo; a wild set in his
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they parted, and my gudesire was to ride hame through the wood of
      Pitmurkie, that is a&rsquo; fou of black firs, as they say. I ken the wood, but
      the firs may be black or white for what I can tell. At the entry of the
      wood there is a wild common, and on the edge of the common a little lonely
      change-house, that was keepit then by an hostler wife,&mdash;they suld hae
      caa&rsquo;d her Tibbie Faw,&mdash;and there puir Steenie cried for a mutchkin of
      brandy, for he had had no refreshment the haill day. Tibbie was earnest
      wi&rsquo; him to take a bite of meat, but he couldna think o&rsquo; &lsquo;t, nor would he
      take his foot out of the stirrup, and took off the brandy, wholely at twa
      draughts, and named a toast at each. The first was, the memory of Sir
      Robert Redgauntlet, and may he never lie quiet in his grave till he had
      righted his poor bond-tenant; and the second was, a health to Man&rsquo;s Enemy,
      if he would but get him back the pock of siller, or tell him what came o&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;t, for he saw the haill world was like to regard him as a thief and a
      cheat, and he took that waur than even the ruin of his house and hauld.
    </p>
    <p>
      On he rode, little caring where. It was a dark night turned, and the trees
      made it yet darker, and he let the beast take its ain road through the
      wood; when all of a sudden, from tired and wearied that it was before, the
      nag began to spring and flee and stend, that my gudesire could hardly keep
      the saddle. Upon the whilk, a horseman, suddenly riding up beside him,
      said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a mettle beast of yours, freend; will you sell him?&rdquo; So
      saying, he touched the horse&rsquo;s neck with his riding-wand, and it fell into
      its auld heigh-ho of a stumbling trot. &ldquo;But his spunk&rsquo;s soon out of him, I
      think,&rdquo; continued the stranger, &ldquo;and that is like mony a man&rsquo;s courage,
      that thinks he wad do great things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My gudesire scarce listened to this, but spurred his horse, with
      &ldquo;Gude-e&rsquo;en to you, freend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it&rsquo;s like the stranger was ane that doesna lightly yield his point;
      for, ride as Steenie liked, he was aye beside him at the selfsame pace. At
      last my gudesire, Steenie Steenson, grew half angry, and, to say the
      truth, half feard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that you want with me, freend?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If ye be a robber, I
      have nae money; if ye be a leal man, wanting company, I have nae heart to
      mirth or speaking; and if ye want to ken the road, I scarce ken it
      mysell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will tell me your grief,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;I am one that,
      though I have been sair miscaa&rsquo;d in the world, am the only hand for
      helping my freends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So my gudesire, to ease his ain heart, mair than from any hope of help,
      told him the story from beginning to end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hard pinch,&rdquo; said the stranger; &ldquo;but I think I can help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could lend me the money, sir, and take a lang day&mdash;I ken nae
      other help on earth,&rdquo; said my gudesire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there may be some under the earth,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;Come, I&rsquo;ll be
      frank wi&rsquo; you; I could lend you the money on bond, but you would maybe
      scruple my terms. Now I can tell you that your auld laird is disturbed in
      his grave by your curses and the wailing of your family, and if ye daur
      venture to go to see him, he will give you the receipt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My gudesire&rsquo;s hair stood on end at this proposal, but he thought his
      companion might be some humoursome chield that was trying to frighten him,
      and might end with lending him the money. Besides, he was bauld wi&rsquo; 
      brandy, and desperate wi&rsquo; distress; and he said he had courage to go to
      the gate of hell, and a step farther, for that receipt. The stranger
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weel, they rode on through the thickest of the wood, when, all of a
      sudden, the horse stopped at the door of a great house; and, but that he
      knew the place was ten miles off, my father would have thought he was at
      Redgauntlet Castle. They rode into the outer courtyard, through the muckle
      faulding yetts, and aneath the auld portcullis; and the whole front of the
      house was lighted, and there were pipes and fiddles, and as much dancing
      and deray within as used to be at Sir Robert&rsquo;s house at Pace and Yule, and
      such high seasons. They lap off, and my gudesire, as seemed to him,
      fastened his horse to the very ring he had tied him to that morning when
      he gaed to wait on the young Sir John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God!&rdquo; said my gudesire, &ldquo;if Sir Robert&rsquo;s death be but a dream!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knocked at the ha&rsquo; door just as he was wont, and his auld acquaintance,
      Dougal MacCallum&mdash;just after his wont, too&mdash;came to open the
      door, and said, &ldquo;Piper Steenie, are ye there lad? Sir Robert has been
      crying for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My gudesire was like a man in a dream&mdash;he looked for the stranger,
      but he was gane for the time. At last he just tried to say, &ldquo;Ha! Dougal
      Driveower, are you living? I thought ye had been dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fash yoursell wi&rsquo; me,&rdquo; said Dougal, &ldquo;but look to yoursell; and see
      ye tak&rsquo; naething frae onybody here, neither meat, drink, or siller, except
      the receipt that is your ain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he led the way out through the halls and trances that were weel
      kend to my gudesire, and into the auld oak parlour; and there was as much
      singing of profane sangs, and birling of red wine, and blasphemy and
      sculduddery, as had ever been in Redgauntlet Castle when it was at the
      blythest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lord take us in keeping! What a set of ghastly revellers there were
      that sat around that table! My gudesire kend mony that had long before
      gane to their place, for often had he piped to the most part in the hall
      of Redgauntlet. There was the fierce Middleton, and the dissolute Rothes,
      and the crafty Lauderdale; and Dalyell, with his bald head and a beard to
      his girdle; and Earlshall, with Cameron&rsquo;s blude on his hand; and wild
      Bonshaw, that tied blessed Mr. Cargill&rsquo;s limbs till the blude sprung; and
      Dumbarton Douglas, the twice turned traitor baith to country and king.
      There was the Bludy Advocate MacKenyie, who, for his worldly wit and
      wisdom, had been to the rest as a god. And there was Claverhouse, as
      beautiful as when he lived, with his long, dark, curled locks streaming
      down over his laced buff-coat, and with his left hand always on his right
      spule-blade, to hide the wound that the silver bullet had made. He sat
      apart from them all, and looked at them with a melancholy, haughty
      countenance; while the rest hallooed and sang and laughed, that the room
      rang. But their smiles were fearfully contorted from time to time; and
      their laughter passed into such wild sounds as made my gudesire&rsquo;s very
      nails grow blue, and chilled the marrow in his banes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They that waited at the table were just the wicked serving-men and
      troopers that had done their work and cruel bidding on earth. There was
      the Lang Lad of the Nethertown, that helped to take Argyle; and the
      bishop&rsquo;s summoner, that they called the Deil&rsquo;s Rattlebag; and the wicked
      guardsmen in their laced coats; and the savage Highland Amorites, that
      shed blood like water; and mony a proud serving-man, haughty of heart and
      bloody of hand, cringing to the rich, and making them wickeder than they
      would be; grinding the poor to powder when the rich had broken them to
      fragments. And mony, mony mair were coming and ganging, a&rsquo; as busy in
      their vocation as if they had been alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert Redgauntlet, in the midst of a&rsquo; this fearful riot, cried, wi&rsquo; a
      voice like thunder, on Steenie Piper to come to the board-head where he
      was sitting, his legs stretched out before him, and swathed up with
      flannel, with his holster pistols aside him, while the great broadsword
      rested against his chair, just as my gudesire had seen him the last time
      upon earth; the very cushion for the jackanape was close to him, but the
      creature itsell was not there&mdash;it wasna its hour, it&rsquo;s likely; for he
      heard them say, as he came forward, &ldquo;Is not the major come yet?&rdquo; And
      another answered, &ldquo;The jackanape will be here betimes the morn.&rdquo; And when
      my gudesire came forward, Sir Robert or his ghaist, or the deevil in his
      likeness, said, &ldquo;Weel, piper, hae ye settled wi&rsquo; my son for the year&rsquo;s
      rent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With much ado my father gat breath to say that Sir John would not settle
      without his honour&rsquo;s receipt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye shall hae that for a tune of the pipes, Steenie,&rdquo; said the appearance
      of Sir Robert&mdash;&ldquo;play us up &lsquo;Weel Hoddled, Luckie.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now this was a tune my gudesire learned frae a warlock, that heard it when
      they were worshipping Satan at their meetings; and my gudesire had
      sometimes played it at the ranting suppers in Redgauntlet Castle, but
      never very willingly; and now he grew cauld at the very name of it, and
      said, for excuse, he hadna his pipes wi&rsquo; him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MacCallum, ye limb of Beelzebub,&rdquo; said the fearfu&rsquo; Sir Robert, &ldquo;bring
      Steenie the pipes that I am keeping for him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      MacCallum brought a pair of pipes might have served the piper of Donald of
      the Isles. But he gave my gudesire a nudge as he offered them; and looking
      secretly and closely, Steenie saw that the chanter was of steel, and
      heated to a white heat; so he had fair warning not to trust his fingers
      with it. So he excused himsell again, and said he was faint and
      frightened, and had not wind aneugh to fill the bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then ye maun eat and drink, Steenie,&rdquo; said the figure; &ldquo;for we do little
      else here; and it&rsquo;s ill speaking between a fou man and a fasting.&rdquo; Now
      these were the very words that the bloody Earl of Douglas said to keep the
      king&rsquo;s messenger in hand while he cut the head off MacLellan of Bombie, at
      the Threave Castle; and put Steenie mair and mair on his guard. So he
      spoke up like a man, and said he came neither to eat nor drink, nor make
      minstrelsy; but simply for his ain&mdash;to ken what was come o&rsquo; the money
      he had paid, and to get a discharge for it; and he was so stout-hearted by
      this time that he charged Sir Robert for conscience&rsquo;s sake (he had no
      power to say the holy name), and as he hoped for peace and rest, to spread
      no snares for him, but just to give him his ain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance gnashed its teeth and laughed, but it took from a large
      pocket-book the receipt, and handed it to Steenie. &ldquo;There is your receipt,
      ye pitiful cur; and for the money, my dog-whelp of a son may go look for
      it in the Cat&rsquo;s Cradle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My gudesire uttered mony thanks, and was about to retire, when Sir Robert
      roared aloud, &ldquo;Stop, though, thou sack-doudling son of a &mdash;! I am not
      done with thee. HERE we do nothing for nothing; and you must return on
      this very day twelvemonth to pay your master the homage that you owe me
      for my protection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My father&rsquo;s tongue was loosed of a suddenty, and he said aloud, &ldquo;I refer
      myself to God&rsquo;s pleasure, and not to yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had no sooner uttered the word than all was dark around him; and he
      sank on the earth with such a sudden shock that he lost both breath and
      sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      How lang Steenie lay there he could not tell; but when he came to himsell
      he was lying in the auld kirkyard of Redgauntlet parochine, just at the
      door of the family aisle, and the scutcheon of the auld knight, Sir
      Robert, hanging over his head. There was a deep morning fog on grass and
      gravestane around him, and his horse was feeding quietly beside the
      minister&rsquo;s twa cows. Steenie would have thought the whole was a dream, but
      he had the receipt in his hand fairly written and signed by the auld
      laird; only the last letters of his name were a little disorderly, written
      like one seized with sudden pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorely troubled in his mind, he left that dreary place, rode through the
      mist to Redgauntlet Castle, and with much ado he got speech of the laird.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you dyvour bankrupt,&rdquo; was the first word, &ldquo;have you brought me my
      rent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered my gudesire, &ldquo;I have not; but I have brought your honour
      Sir Robert&rsquo;s receipt for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, sirrah? Sir Robert&rsquo;s receipt! You told me he had not given you one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will your honour please to see if that bit line is right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir John looked at every line, and at every letter, with much attention;
      and at last at the date, which my gudesire had not observed&mdash;&ldquo;From my
      appointed place,&rdquo; he read, &ldquo;this twenty-fifth of November.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! That is yesterday! Villain, thou must have gone to hell for this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got it from your honour&rsquo;s father; whether he be in heaven or hell, I
      know not,&rdquo; said Steenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will debate you for a warlock to the Privy Council!&rdquo; said Sir John. &ldquo;I
      will send you to your master, the devil, with the help of a tar-barrel and
      a torch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend to debate mysell to the Presbytery,&rdquo; said Steenie, &ldquo;and tell
      them all I have seen last night, whilk are things fitter for them to judge
      of than a borrel man like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir John paused, composed himsell, and desired to hear the full history;
      and my gudesire told it him from point to point, as I have told it you&mdash;neither
      more nor less.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John was silent again for a long time, and at last he said, very
      composedly: &ldquo;Steenie, this story of yours concerns the honour of many a
      noble family besides mine; and if it be a leasing-making, to keep yourself
      out of my danger, the least you can expect is to have a red-hot iron
      driven through your tongue, and that will be as bad as scaulding your
      fingers wi&rsquo; a red-hot chanter. But yet it may be true, Steenie; and if the
      money cast up, I shall not know what to think of it. But where shall we
      find the Cat&rsquo;s Cradle? There are cats enough about the old house, but I
      think they kitten without the ceremony of bed or cradle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were best ask Hutcheon,&rdquo; said my gudesire; &ldquo;he kens a&rsquo; the odd corners
      about as weel as&mdash;another serving-man that is now gane, and that I
      wad not like to name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aweel, Hutcheon, when he was asked, told them that a ruinous turret lang
      disused, next to the clock-house, only accessible by a ladder, for the
      opening was on the outside, above the battlements, was called of old the
      Cat&rsquo;s Cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will I go immediately,&rdquo; said Sir John; and he took&mdash;with what
      purpose Heaven kens&mdash;one of his father&rsquo;s pistols from the hall table,
      where they had lain since the night he died, and hastened to the
      battlements.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a dangerous place to climb, for the ladder was auld and frail, and
      wanted ane or twa rounds. However, up got Sir John, and entered at the
      turret door, where his body stopped the only little light that was in the
      bit turret. Something flees at him wi&rsquo; a vengeance, maist dang him back
      ower&mdash;bang! gaed the knight&rsquo;s pistol, and Hutcheon, that held the
      ladder, and my gudesire, that stood beside him, hears a loud skelloch. A
      minute after, Sir John flings the body of the jackanape down to them, and
      cries that the siller is fund, and that they should come up and help him.
      And there was the bag of siller sure aneaugh, and mony orra thing besides,
      that had been missing for mony a day. And Sir John, when he had riped the
      turret weel, led my gudesire into the dining-parlour, and took him by the
      hand, and spoke kindly to him, and said he was sorry he should have
      doubted his word, and that he would hereafter be a good master to him, to
      make amends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Steenie,&rdquo; said Sir John, &ldquo;although this vision of yours tends,
      on the whole, to my father&rsquo;s credit as an honest man, that he should, even
      after his death, desire to see justice done to a poor man like you, yet
      you are sensible that ill-dispositioned men might make bad constructions
      upon it concerning his soul&rsquo;s health. So, I think, we had better lay the
      haill dirdum on that ill-deedie creature, Major Weir, and say naething
      about your dream in the wood of Pitmurkie. You had taen ower-muckle brandy
      to be very certain about onything; and, Steenie, this receipt&rdquo;&mdash;his
      hand shook while he held it out&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s but a queer kind of document,
      and we will do best, I think, to put it quietly in the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Od, but for as queer as it is, it&rsquo;s a&rsquo; the voucher I have for my rent,&rdquo;
       said my gudesire, who was afraid, it may be, of losing the benefit of Sir
      Robert&rsquo;s discharge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will bear the contents to your credit in the rental-book, and give you
      a discharge under my own hand,&rdquo; said Sir John, &ldquo;and that on the spot. And,
      Steenie, if you can hold your tongue about this matter, you shall sit,
      from this time downward, at an easier rent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mony thanks to your honour,&rdquo; said Steenie, who saw easily in what corner
      the wind was; &ldquo;doubtless I will be conformable to all your honour&rsquo;s
      commands; only I would willingly speak wi&rsquo; some powerful minister on the
      subject, for I do not like the sort of soumons of appointment whilk your
      honour&rsquo;s father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not call the phantom my father!&rdquo; said Sir John, interrupting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, the thing that was so like him,&rdquo; said my gudesire; &ldquo;he spoke
      of my coming back to see him this time twelvemonth, and it&rsquo;s a weight on
      my conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aweel then,&rdquo; said Sir John, &ldquo;if you be so much distressed in mind, you
      may speak to our minister of the parish; he is a douce man, regards the
      honour of our family, and the mair that he may look for some patronage
      from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wi&rsquo; that, my father readily agreed that the receipt should be burnt; and
      the laird threw it into the chimney with his ain hand. Burn it would not
      for them, though; but away it flew up the lum, wi&rsquo; a lang train of sparks
      at its tail, and a hissing noise like a squib.
    </p>
    <p>
      My gudesire gaed down to the manse, and the minister, when he had heard
      the story, said it was his real opinion that, though my gudesire had gane
      very far in tampering with dangerous matters, yet as he had refused the
      devil&rsquo;s arles (for such was the offer of meat and drink), and had refused
      to do homage by piping at his bidding, he hoped that, if he held a
      circumspect walk hereafter, Satan could take little advantage by what was
      come and gane. And, indeed, my gudesire, of his ain accord, lang forswore
      baith the pipes and the brandy&mdash;it was not even till the year was
      out, and the fatal day past, that he would so much as take the fiddle or
      drink usquebaugh or tippenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John made up his story about the jackanape as he liked himsell; and
      some believe till this day there was no more in the matter than the
      filching nature of the brute. Indeed, ye &lsquo;ll no hinder some to thread that
      it was nane o&rsquo; the auld Enemy that Dougal and Hutcheon saw in the laird&rsquo;s
      room, but only that wanchancie creature the major, capering on the coffin;
      and that, as to the blawing on the laird&rsquo;s whistle that was heard after he
      was dead, the filthy brute could do that as weel as the laird himsell, if
      no better. But Heaven kens the truth, whilk first came out by the
      minister&rsquo;s wife, after Sir John and her ain gudeman were baith in the
      moulds. And then my gudesire, wha was failed in his limbs, but not in his
      judgment or memory,&mdash;at least nothing to speak of,&mdash;was obliged
      to tell the real narrative to his freends, for the credit of his good
      name. He might else have been charged for a warlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shades of evening were growing thicker around us as my conductor
      finished his long narrative with this moral: &ldquo;You see, birkie, it is nae
      chancy thing to tak&rsquo; a stranger traveller for a guide when you are in an
      uncouth land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not have made that inference,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Your grandfather&rsquo;s
      adventure was fortunate for himself, whom it saves from ruin and distress;
      and fortunate for his landlord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but they had baith to sup the sauce o&rsquo; &lsquo;t sooner or later,&rdquo; said
      Wandering Willie; &ldquo;what was fristed wasna forgiven. Sir John died before
      he was much over threescore; and it was just like a moment&rsquo;s illness. And
      for my gudesire, though he departed in fulness of life, yet there was my
      father, a yauld man of forty-five, fell down betwixt the stilts of his
      plough, and rase never again, and left nae bairn but me, a puir,
      sightless, fatherless, motherless creature, could neither work nor want.
      Things gaed weel aneugh at first; for Sir Regwald Redgauntlet, the only
      son of Sir John, and the oye of auld Sir Robert, and, wae&rsquo;s me! the last
      of the honourable house, took the farm aff our hands, and brought me into
      his household to have care of me. My head never settled since I lost him;
      and if I say another word about it, deil a bar will I have the heart to
      play the night. Look out, my gentle chap,&rdquo; he resumed, in a different
      tone; &ldquo;ye should see the lights at Brokenburn Glen by this time.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE GLENMUTCHKIN RAILWAY, By Professor Aytoun
    </h2>
    <p>
      [The following tale appeared in &ldquo;Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine&rdquo; for October, 1845.
      It was intended by the writer as a sketch of some of the more striking
      features of the railway mania (then in full progress throughout Great
      Britain), as exhibited in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Although bearing the
      appearance of a burlesque, it was in truth an accurate delineation (as
      will be acknowledged by many a gentleman who had the misfortune to be &ldquo;out
      in the Forty-five&rdquo;); and subsequent disclosures have shown that it was in
      no way exaggerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the &ldquo;Glenmutchkin line&rdquo; was purely imaginary, and was not
      intended by the writer to apply to any particular scheme then before the
      public, it was identified in Scotland with more than one reckless and
      impracticable project; and even the characters introduced were supposed to
      be typical of personages who had attained some notoriety in the throng of
      speculation. Any such resemblances must be considered as fortuitous; for
      the writer cannot charge himself with the discourtesy of individual satire
      or allusion.]
    </p>
    <p>
      I was confoundedly hard up. My patrimony, never of the largest, had been
      for the last year on the decrease,&mdash;a herald would have emblazoned
      it, &ldquo;ARGENT, a money-bag improper, in detriment,&rdquo;&mdash;and though the
      attenuating process was not excessively rapid, it was, nevertheless,
      proceeding at a steady ratio. As for the ordinary means and appliances by
      which men contrive to recruit their exhausted exchequers, I knew none of
      them. Work I abhorred with a detestation worthy of a scion of nobility;
      and, I believe, you could just as soon have persuaded the lineal
      representative of the Howards or Percys to exhibit himself in the
      character of a mountebank, as have got me to trust my person on the
      pinnacle of a three-legged stool. The rule of three is all very well for
      base mechanical souls; but I flatter myself I have an intellect too large
      to be limited to a ledger. &ldquo;Augustus,&rdquo; said my poor mother to me, while
      stroking my hyacinthine tresses, one fine morning, in the very dawn and
      budding-time of my existence&mdash;&ldquo;Augustus, my dear boy, whatever you
      do, never forget that you are a gentleman.&rdquo; The maternal maxim sank deeply
      into my heart, and I never for a moment have forgotten it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding this aristocratic resolution, the great practical
      question, &ldquo;How am I to live?&rdquo; began to thrust itself unpleasantly before
      me. I am one of that unfortunate class who have neither uncles nor aunts.
      For me, no yellow liverless individual, with characteristic bamboo and
      pigtail,&mdash;emblems of half a million,&mdash;returned to his native
      shores from Ceylon or remote Penang. For me, no venerable spinster hoarded
      in the Trongate, permitting herself few luxuries during a long protracted
      life, save a lass and a lanthorn, a parrot, and the invariable baudrons of
      antiquity. No such luck was mine. Had all Glasgow perished by some vast
      epidemic, I should not have found myself one farthing the richer. There
      would have been no golden balsam for me in the accumulated woes of
      Tradestown, Shettleston, and Camlachie. The time has been when&mdash;according
      to Washington Irving and other veracious historians&mdash;a young man had
      no sooner got into difficulties than a guardian angel appeared to him in a
      dream, with the information that at such and such a bridge, or under such
      and such a tree, he might find, at a slight expenditure of labour, a
      gallipot secured with bladder, and filled with glittering tomans; or, in
      the extremity of despair, the youth had only to append himself to a cord,
      and straightway the other end thereof, forsaking its staple in the roof,
      would disclose amid the fractured ceiling the glories of a profitable
      pose. These blessed days have long since gone by&mdash;at any rate, no
      such luck was mine. My guardian angel was either wofully ignorant of
      metallurgy, or the stores had been surreptitiously ransacked; and as to
      the other expedient, I frankly confess I should have liked some better
      security for its result than the precedent of the &ldquo;Heir of Lynn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is a great consolation, amid all the evils of life, to know that,
      however bad your circumstances may be, there is always somebody else in
      nearly the same predicament. My chosen friend and ally, Bob M&rsquo;Corkindale,
      was equally hard up with myself, and, if possible, more averse to
      exertion. Bob was essentially a speculative man&mdash;that is, in a
      philosophical sense. He had once got hold of a stray volume of Adam Smith,
      and muddled his brains for a whole week over the intricacies of the
      &ldquo;Wealth of Nations.&rdquo; The result was a crude farrago of notions regarding
      the true nature of money, the soundness of currency, and relative value of
      capital, with which he nightly favoured an admiring audience at &ldquo;The
      Crow&rdquo;; for Bob was by no means&mdash;in the literal acceptation of the
      word&mdash;a dry philosopher. On the contrary, he perfectly appreciated
      the merits of each distinct distillery, and was understood to be the
      compiler of a statistical work entitled &ldquo;A Tour through the Alcoholic
      Districts of Scotland.&rdquo; It had very early occurred to me, who knew as much
      of political economy as of the bagpipes, that a gentleman so well versed
      in the art of accumulating national wealth must have some remote ideas of
      applying his principles profitably on a smaller scale. Accordingly I gave
      M&rsquo;Corkindale an unlimited invitation to my lodgings; and, like a good
      hearty fellow as he was, he availed himself every evening of the license;
      for I had laid in a fourteen-gallon cask of Oban whisky, and the quality
      of the malt was undeniable.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the first glorious days of general speculation. Railroads were
      emerging from the hands of the greater into the fingers of the lesser
      capitalists. Two successful harvests had given a fearful stimulus to the
      national energy; and it appeared perfectly certain that all the populous
      towns would be united, and the rich agricultural districts intersected, by
      the magical bands of iron. The columns of the newspapers teemed every week
      with the parturition of novel schemes; and the shares were no sooner
      announced than they were rapidly subscribed for. But what is the use of my
      saying anything more about the history of last year? Every one of us
      remembers it perfectly well. It was a capital year on the whole, and put
      money into many a pocket. About that time, Bob and I commenced operations.
      Our available capital, or negotiable bullion, in the language of my
      friend, amounted to about three hundred pounds, which we set aside as a
      joint fund for speculation. Bob, in a series of learned discourses, had
      convinced me that it was not only folly, but a positive sin, to leave this
      sum lying in the bank at a pitiful rate of interest, and otherwise
      unemployed, while every one else in the kingdom was having a pluck at the
      public pigeon. Somehow or other, we were unlucky in our first attempts.
      Speculators are like wasps; for when they have once got hold of a ripening
      and peach-like project, they keep it rigidly for their own swarm, and
      repel the approach of interlopers. Notwithstanding all our efforts, and
      very ingenious ones they were, we never, in a single instance, succeeded
      in procuring an allocation of original shares; and though we did now and
      then make a bit by purchase, we more frequently bought at a premium, and
      parted with our scrip at a discount. At the end of six months we were not
      twenty pounds richer than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will never do,&rdquo; said Bob, as he sat one evening in my rooms
      compounding his second tumbler. &ldquo;I thought we were living in an
      enlightened age; but I find I was mistaken. That brutal spirit of monopoly
      is still abroad and uncurbed. The principles of free trade are utterly
      forgotten, or misunderstood. Else how comes it that David Spreul received
      but yesterday an allocation of two hundred shares in the Westermidden
      Junction, while your application and mine, for a thousand each were
      overlooked? Is this a state of things to be tolerated? Why should he, with
      his fifty thousand pounds, receive a slapping premium, while our three
      hundred of available capital remains unrepresented? The fact is monstrous,
      and demands the immediate and serious interference of the legislature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a burning shame,&rdquo; said I, fully alive to the manifold advantages of
      a premium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Dunshunner,&rdquo; rejoined M&rsquo;Corkindale, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no use
      going on in this way. We haven&rsquo;t shown half pluck enough. These fellows
      consider us as snobs because we don&rsquo;t take the bull by the horns. Now&rsquo;s
      the time for a bold stroke. The public are quite ready to subscribe for
      anything&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll start a railway for ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Start a railway with three hundred pounds of capital!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw, man! you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about&mdash;we&rsquo;ve a great
      deal more capital than that. Have not I told you, seventy times over, that
      everything a man has&mdash;his coat, his hat, the tumblers he drinks from,
      nay, his very corporeal existence&mdash;is absolute marketable capital?
      What do you call that fourteen-gallon cask, I should like to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A compound of hoops and staves, containing about a quart and a half of
      spirits&mdash;you have effectually accounted for the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it has gone to the fund of profit and loss, that&rsquo;s all. Never let me
      hear you sport those old theories again. Capital is indestructible, as I
      am ready to prove to you any day, in half an hour. But let us sit down
      seriously to business. We are rich enough to pay for the advertisements,
      and that is all we need care for in the meantime. The public is sure to
      step in, and bear us out handsomely with the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where in the face of the habitable globe shall the railway be?
      England is out of the question, and I hardly know a spot in the Lowlands
      that is not occupied already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say to a Spanish scheme&mdash;the Alcantara Union? Hang me if
      I know whether Alcantara is in Spain or Portugal; but nobody else does,
      and the one is quite as good as the other. Or what would you think of the
      Palermo Railway, with a branch to the sulphur-mines?&mdash;that would be
      popular in the north&mdash;or the Pyrenees Direct? They would all go to a
      premium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must confess I should prefer a line at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, why not try the Highlands? There must be lots of traffic there
      in the shape of sheep, grouse, and Cockney tourists, not to mention salmon
      and other etceteras. Couldn&rsquo;t we tip them a railway somewhere in the
      west?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Glenmutchkin, for instance&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital, my dear fellow! Glorious! By Jove, first-rate!&rdquo; shouted Bob, in
      an ecstasy of delight. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a distillery there, you know, and a
      fishing-village at the foot&mdash;at least, there used to be six years
      ago, when I was living with the exciseman. There may be some bother about
      the population, though. The last laird shipped every mother&rsquo;s son of the
      aboriginal Celts to America; but, after all, that&rsquo;s not of much
      consequence. I see the whole thing! Unrivalled scenery&mdash;stupendous
      waterfalls&mdash;herds of black cattle&mdash;spot where Prince Charles
      Edward met Macgrugar of Glengrugar and his clan! We could not possibly
      have lighted on a more promising place. Hand us over that sheet of paper,
      like a good fellow, and a pen. There is no time to be lost, and the sooner
      we get out the prospectus the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Heaven bless you, Bob, there&rsquo;s a great deal to be thought of first.
      Who are we to get for a provisional committee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very true,&rdquo; said Bob, musingly. &ldquo;We <i>must</i> treat them to some
      respectable names, that is, good-sounding ones. I&rsquo;m afraid there is little
      chance of our producing a peer to begin with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever&mdash;unless we could invent one, and that&rsquo;s hardly safe;
      &lsquo;Burke&rsquo;s Peerage&rsquo; has gone through too many editions. Couldn&rsquo;t we try the
      Dormants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be rather dangerous in the teeth of the standing orders. But
      what do you say to a baronet? There&rsquo;s Sir Polloxfen Tremens. He got
      himself served the other day to a Nova Scotia baronetcy, with just as much
      title as you or I have; and he has sported the riband, and dined out on
      the strength of it ever since. He&rsquo;ll join us at once, for he has not a
      sixpence to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down with him, then,&rdquo; and we headed the provisional list with the pseudo
      Orange tawny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s quite indispensable, as this is a Highland line,
      that we should put forward a chief or two. That has always a great effect
      upon the English, whose feudal notions are rather of the mistiest, and
      principally derived from Waverley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not write yourself down as the laird of M&rsquo;Corkindale?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I
      dare say you would not be negatived by a counter-claim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would hardly do,&rdquo; replied Bob, &ldquo;as I intend to be secretary. After
      all, what&rsquo;s the use of thinking about it? Here goes for an extempore
      chief;&rdquo; and the villain wrote down the name of Tavish M&rsquo;Tavish of
      Invertavish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, though,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we must have a real Highlander on the list. If
      we go on this way, it will become a justiciary matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re devilish scrupulous, Gus,&rdquo; said Bob, who, if left to himself,
      would have stuck in the names of the heathen gods and goddesses, or
      borrowed his directors from the Ossianic chronicles, rather than have
      delayed the prospectus. &ldquo;Where the mischief are we to find the men? I can
      think of no others likely to go the whole hog; can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know a single Celt in Glasgow except old M&rsquo;Closkie, the drunken
      porter at the corner of Jamaica Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the very man! I suppose, after the manner of his tribe, he will do
      anything for a pint of whisky. But what shall we call him? Jamaica Street,
      I fear, will hardly do for a designation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call him THE M&rsquo;CLOSKIE. It will be sonorous in the ears of the Saxon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; and another chief was added to the roll of the clans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;we must put you down. Recollect, all the management,
      that is, the allocation, will be intrusted to you. Augustus&mdash;you
      haven&rsquo;t a middle name, I think?&mdash;well then, suppose we interpolate
      &lsquo;Reginald&rsquo;; it has a smack of the crusades. Augustus Reginald Dunshunner,
      Esq. of&mdash;where, in the name of Munchausen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. I never had any land beyond the contents of a
      flower-pot. Stay&mdash;I rather think I have a superiority somewhere about
      Paisley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the thing!&rdquo; cried Bob. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s heritable property, and therefore
      titular. What&rsquo;s the denomination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;St. Mirrens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful! Dunshunner of St. Mirrens, I give you joy! Had you discovered
      that a little sooner&mdash;and I wonder you did not think of it&mdash;we
      might both of us have had lots of allocations. These are not the times to
      conceal hereditary distinctions. But now comes the serious work. We must
      have one or two men of known wealth upon the list. The chaff is nothing
      without a decoy-bird. Now, can&rsquo;t you help me with a name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the game is up, and the whole scheme exploded. I
      would as soon undertake to evoke the ghost of Croesus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunshunner,&rdquo; said Bob, very seriously, &ldquo;to be a man of information, you
      are possessed of marvellous few resources. I am quite ashamed of you. Now
      listen to me. I have thought deeply upon this subject, and am quite
      convinced that, with some little trouble, we may secure the cooperation of
      a most wealthy and influential body&mdash;one, too, that is generally
      supposed to have stood aloof from all speculation of the kind, and whose
      name would be a tower of strength in the moneyed quarters. I allude,&rdquo;
       continued Bob, reaching across for the kettle, &ldquo;to the great dissenting
      interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The what?&rdquo; cried I, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great dissenting interest. You can&rsquo;t have failed to observe the row
      they have lately been making about Sunday travelling and education. Old
      Sam Sawley, the coffin-maker, is their principal spokesman here; and
      wherever he goes the rest will follow, like a flock of sheep bounding
      after a patriarchal ram. I propose, therefore, to wait upon him to-morrow,
      and request his cooperation in a scheme which is not only to prove
      profitable, but to make head against the lax principles of the present
      age. Leave me alone to tickle him. I consider his name, and those of one
      or two others belonging to the same meeting-house,&mdash;fellows with
      bank-stock and all sorts of tin,&mdash;as perfectly secure. These
      dissenters smell a premium from an almost incredible distance. We can fill
      up the rest of the committee with ciphers, and the whole thing is done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the engineer&mdash;we must announce such an officer as a matter of
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought of that,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we hire a fellow from one
      of the steamboats?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear that might get us into trouble. You know there are such things as
      gradients and sections to be prepared. But there&rsquo;s Watty Solder, the
      gas-fitter, who failed the other day. He&rsquo;s a sort of civil engineer by
      trade, and will jump at the proposal like a trout at the tail of a
      May-fly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed. Now then, let&rsquo;s fix the number of shares. This is our first
      experiment, and I think we ought to be moderate. No sound political
      economist is avaricious. Let us say twelve thousand, at twenty pounds
      apiece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, that&rsquo;s arranged. I&rsquo;ll see Sawley and the rest to-morrow,
      settle with Solder, and then write out the prospectus. You look in upon me
      in the evening, and we&rsquo;ll revise it together. Now, by your leave, let&rsquo;s
      have a Welsh rabbit and another tumbler to drink success and prosperity to
      the Glenmutchkin Railway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I confess that, when I rose on the morrow, with a slight headache and a
      tongue indifferently parched, I recalled to memory, not without
      perturbation of conscience and some internal qualms, the conversation of
      the previous evening. I felt relieved, however, after two spoonfuls of
      carbonate of soda, and a glance at the newspaper, wherein I perceived the
      announcement of no less than four other schemes equally preposterous with
      our own. But, after all, what right had I to assume that the Glenmutchkin
      project would prove an ultimate failure? I had not a scrap of statistical
      information that might entitle me to form such an opinion. At any rate,
      Parliament, by substituting the Board of Trade as an initiating body of
      inquiry, had created a responsible tribunal, and freed us from the chance
      of obloquy. I saw before me a vision of six months&rsquo; steady gambling, at
      manifest advantage, in the shares, before a report could possibly be
      pronounced, or our proceedings be in any way overhauled. Of course, I
      attended that evening punctually at my friend M&rsquo;Corkindale&rsquo;s. Bob was in
      high feather; for Sawley no sooner heard of the principles upon which the
      railway was to be conducted, and his own nomination as a director, than he
      gave in his adhesion, and promised his unflinching support to the
      uttermost. The prospectus ran as follows:

</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The necessity of a direct line of Railway communication through the
      fertile and populous district known as the VALLEY OF GLENMUTCHKIN has been
      long felt and universally acknowledged. Independently of the surpassing
      grandeur of its mountain scenery, which shall immediately be referred to,
      and other considerations of even greater importance, GLENMUTCHKIN is known
      to the capitalist as the most important BREEDING-STATION in the Highlands
      of Scotland, and indeed as the great emporium from which the southern
      markets are supplied. It has been calculated by a most eminent authority
      that every acre in the strath is capable of rearing twenty head of cattle;
      and as it has been ascertained, after a careful admeasurement, that there
      are not less than TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND improvable acres immediately
      contiguous to the proposed line of Railway, it may confidently be assumed
      that the number of Cattle to be conveyed along the line will amount to
      FOUR MILLIONS annually, which, at the lowest estimate, would yield a
      revenue larger, in proportion to the capital subscribed, than that of any
      Railway as yet completed within the United Kingdom. From this estimate the
      traffic in Sheep and Goats, with which the mountains are literally
      covered, has been carefully excluded, it having been found quite
      impossible (from its extent) to compute the actual revenue to be drawn
      from that most important branch. It may, however, be roughly assumed as
      from seventeen to nineteen per cent. upon the whole, after deduction of
      the working expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The population of Glenmutchkin is extremely dense. Its situation on the
      west coast has afforded it the means of direct communication with America,
      of which for many years the inhabitants have actively availed themselves.
      Indeed, the amount of exportation of live stock from this part of the
      Highlands to the Western continent has more than once attracted the
      attention of Parliament. The Manufactures are large and comprehensive, and
      include the most famous distilleries in the world. The Minerals are most
      abundant, and among these may be reckoned quartz, porphyry, felspar,
      malachite, manganese, and basalt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the foot of the valley, and close to the sea, lies the important
      village known as the CLACHAN of INVERSTARVE. It is supposed by various
      eminent antiquaries to have been the capital of the Picts, and, among the
      busy inroads of commercial prosperity, it still retains some interesting
      traces of its former grandeur. There is a large fishing station here, to
      which vessels from every nation resort, and the demand for foreign produce
      is daily and steadily increasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a sporting country Glenmutchkin is unrivalled; but it is by the
      tourists that its beauties will most greedily be sought. These consist of
      every combination which plastic nature can afford: cliffs of unusual
      magnitude and grandeur; waterfalls only second to the sublime cascades of
      Norway; woods of which the bark is a remarkably valuable commodity. It
      need scarcely be added, to rouse the enthusiasm inseparable from this
      glorious glen, that here, in 1745, Prince Charles Edward Stuart, then in
      the zenith of his hopes, was joined by the brave Sir Grugar M&rsquo;Grugar at
      the head of his devoted clan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Railway will be twelve miles long, and can be completed within six
      months after the Act of Parliament is obtained. The gradients are easy,
      and the curves obtuse. There are no viaducts of any importance, and only
      four tunnels along the whole length of the line. The shortest of these
      does not exceed a mile and a half.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In conclusion, the projectors of this Railway beg to state that they have
      determined, as a principle, to set their face AGAINST ALL SUNDAY
      TRAVELLING WHATSOEVER, and to oppose EVERY BILL which may hereafter be
      brought into Parliament, unless it shall contain a clause to that effect.
      It is also their intention to take up the cause of the poor and neglected
      STOKER, for whose accommodation, and social, moral, religious, and
      intellectual improvement, a large stock of evangelical tracts will
      speedily be required. Tenders of these, in quantities of not less than
      12,000, may be sent in to the Interim Secretary. Shares must be applied
      for within ten days from the present date.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By order of the Provisional Committee,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ROBERT M&rsquo;CORKINDALE, <i>Secretary</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Bob, slapping down the prospectus on the table with as much
      triumph as if it had been the original of Magna Charta, &ldquo;what do you think
      of that? If it doesn&rsquo;t do the business effectually, I shall submit to be
      called a Dutchman. That last touch about the stoker will bring us in the
      subscriptions of the old ladies by the score.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very masterly indeed,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;But who the deuce is
      Mhic-Mhac-vich-Induibh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bona-fide chief, I assure you, though a little reduced. I picked him up
      upon the Broomielaw. His grandfather had an island somewhere to the west
      of the Hebrides; but it is not laid down in the maps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Captain of M&rsquo;Alcohol?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A crack distiller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Factor for Glentumblers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His principal customer. But, bless you, my dear St. Mirrens! Don&rsquo;t bother
      yourself any more about the committee. They are as respectable a set&mdash;on
      paper at least&mdash;as you would wish to see of a summer&rsquo;s morning, and
      the beauty of it is that they will give us no manner of trouble. Now about
      the allocation. You and I must restrict ourselves to a couple of thousand
      shares apiece. That&rsquo;s only a third of the whole, but it won&rsquo;t do to be
      greedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Bob, consider! Where on earth are we to find the money to pay up the
      deposits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you, the principal director of the Glenmutchkin Railway, ask me, the
      secretary, such a question? Don&rsquo;t you know that any of the banks will give
      us tick to the amount &lsquo;of half the deposits.&rsquo; All that is settled already,
      and you can get your two thousand pounds whenever you please merely for
      the signing of a bill. Sawley must get a thousand according to
      stipulation; Jobson, Heckles, and Grabbie, at least five hundred apiece;
      and another five hundred, I should think, will exhaust the remaining means
      of the committee. So that, out of our whole stock, there remain just five
      thousand shares to be allocated to the speculative and evangelical public.
      My eyes! Won&rsquo;t there be a scramble for them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day our prospectus appeared in the newspapers. It was read,
      canvassed, and generally approved of. During the afternoon I took an
      opportunity of looking into the Tontine, and, while under shelter of the
      Glasgow &ldquo;Herald,&rdquo; my ears were solaced with such ejaculations as the
      following:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Jimsy, hae ye seen this grand new prospectus for a railway tae
      Glenmutchkin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay. It looks no that ill. The Hieland lairds are pitting their best
      foremost. Will ye apply for shares?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll tak&rsquo; twa hundred. Wha&rsquo;s Sir Polloxfen Tremens?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be yin o&rsquo; the Ayrshire folk. He used to rin horses at the Paisley
      races.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;The devil he did!&rdquo; thought I.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo; ye ken ony o&rsquo; the directors, Jimsy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ken Sawley fine. Ye may depend on &lsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a gude thing if he&rsquo;s in &lsquo;t,
      for he&rsquo;s a howkin&rsquo; body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s sure to gae up. What prem. d&rsquo; ye think it will bring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twa pund a share, and maybe mair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Od, I&rsquo;ll apply for three hundred!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven bless you, my dear countrymen!&rdquo; thought I, as I sallied forth to
      refresh myself with a basin of soup, &ldquo;do but maintain this liberal and
      patriotic feeling&mdash;this thirst for national improvement, internal
      communication, and premiums&mdash;a short while longer, and I know whose
      fortune will be made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning my breakfast-table was covered with shoals of
      letters, from fellows whom I scarcely ever had spoken to,&mdash;or who, to
      use a franker phraseology, had scarcely ever condescended to speak to me,&mdash;entreating
      my influence as a director to obtain them shares in the new undertaking. I
      never bore malice in my life, so I chalked them down, without favouritism,
      for a certain proportion. While engaged in this charitable work, the door
      flew open, and M&rsquo;Corkindale, looking utterly haggard with excitement,
      rushed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may buy an estate whenever you please, Dunshunner,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;the
      world&rsquo;s gone perfectly mad! I have been to Blazes, the broker, and he
      tells me that the whole amount of the stock has been subscribed for four
      times over already, and he has not yet got in the returns from Edinburgh
      and Liverpool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they good names, though, Bob&mdash;sure cards&mdash;none of your
      M&rsquo;Closkies and M&rsquo;Alcohols?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first names in the city, I assure you, and most of them holders for
      investment. I wouldn&rsquo;t take ten millions for their capital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the sooner we close the list the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so too. I suspect a rival company will be out before long. Blazes
      says the shares are selling already conditionally on allotment, at seven
      and sixpence premium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce they are! I say, Bob, since we have the cards in our hands,
      would it not be wise to favour them with a few hundreds at that rate? A
      bird in the hand, you know, is worth two in the bush, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know no such maxim in political economy,&rdquo; replied the secretary. &ldquo;Are
      you mad, Dunshunner? How are the shares to go up, if it gets wind that the
      directors are selling already? Our business just now is to <i>bull</i> the
      line, not to <i>bear</i> it; and if you will trust me, I shall show them
      such an operation on the ascending scale as the Stock Exchange has not
      witnessed for this long and many a day. Then to-morrow I shall advertise
      in the papers that the committee, having received applications for ten
      times the amount of stock, have been compelled, unwillingly, to close the
      lists. That will be a slap in the face to the dilatory gentlemen, and send
      up the shares like wildfire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob was right. No sooner did the advertisement appear than a simultaneous
      groan was uttered by some hundreds of disappointed speculators, who, with
      unwonted and unnecessary caution, had been anxious to see their way a
      little before committing themselves to our splendid enterprise. In
      consequence, they rushed into the market, with intense anxiety to make
      what terms they could at the earliest stage, and the seven and sixpence of
      premium was doubled in the course of a forenoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The allocation passed over very peaceably. Sawley, Heckles, Jobson,
      Grabbie, and the Captain of M&rsquo;Alcohol, besides myself, attended, and took
      part in the business. We were also threatened with the presence of the
      M&rsquo;Closkie and Vich-Induibh; but M&rsquo;Corkindale, entertaining some reasonable
      doubts as to the effect which their corporeal appearance might have upon
      the representatives of the dissenting interest, had taken the precaution
      to get them snugly housed in a tavern, where an unbounded supply of
      gratuitous Ferintosh deprived us of the benefit of their experience. We,
      however, allotted them twenty shares apiece. Sir Polloxfen Tremens sent a
      handsome, though rather illegible, letter of apology, dated from an island
      in Loch Lomond, where he was said to be detained on particular business.

      Mr. Sawley, who officiated as our chairman, was kind enough, before
      parting, to pass a very flattering eulogium upon the excellence and
      candour of all the preliminary arrangements. It would now, he said, go
      forth to the public that the line was not, like some others he could
      mention, a mere bubble, emanating from the stank of private interest, but
      a solid, lasting superstructure, based upon the principles of sound return
      for capital, and serious evangelical truth (hear, hear!). The time was
      fast approaching when the gravestone with the words &ldquo;HIC OBIT&rdquo; chiselled
      upon it would be placed at the head of all the other lines which rejected
      the grand opportunity of conveying education to the stoker. The stoker, in
      his (Mr. Sawley&rsquo;s) opinion, had a right to ask the all-important question,
      &ldquo;Am I not a man and a brother?&rdquo; (Cheers.) Much had been said and written
      lately about a work called &ldquo;Tracts for the Times.&rdquo; With the opinions
      contained in that publication he was not conversant, as it was conducted
      by persons of another community from that to which he (Mr. Sawley) had the
      privilege to belong. But he hoped very soon, under the auspices of the
      Glenmutchkin Railway Company, to see a new periodical established, under
      the title of &ldquo;Tracts for the Trains.&rdquo; He never for a moment would relax
      his efforts to knock a nail into the coffin which, he might say, was
      already made and measured and cloth-covered for the reception of all
      establishments; and with these sentiments, and the conviction that the
      shares must rise, could it be doubted that he would remain a fast friend
      to the interests of this company for ever? (Much cheering.)
    </p>
    <p>
      After having delivered this address, Mr. Sawley affectionately squeezed
      the hands of his brother directors, and departed, leaving several of us
      much overcome. As, however, M&rsquo;Corkindale had told me that every one of
      Sawley&rsquo;s shares had been disposed of in the market the day before, I felt
      less compunction at having refused to allow that excellent man an extra
      thousand beyond the amount he had applied for, notwithstanding his
      broadest hints and even private entreaties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound the greedy hypocrite!&rdquo; said Bob; &ldquo;does he think we shall let him
      burke the line for nothing? No&mdash;no! let him go to the brokers and buy
      his shares back, if he thinks they are likely to rise. I&rsquo;ll be bound he
      has made a cool five hundred out of them already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the day which succeeded the allocation, the following entry appeared in
      the Glasgow sharelists: &ldquo;Direct Glenmutchkin Railway 15s. 15s. 6d. 15s.
      6d. 16s. 15s. 6d. 16s. 16s. 6d. 16s. 6d. 16s. 17s. 18s. 18s. 19s. 6d. 21s.
      21s. 22s. 6d. 24s. 25s. 6d. 27s. 29s. 29s. 6d. 30s. 31s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They might go higher, and they ought to go higher,&rdquo; said Bob, musingly;
      &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s not much more stock to come and go upon, and these two
      share-sharks, Jobson and Grabbie, I know, will be in the market to-morrow.
      We must not let them have the whip-hand of us. I think upon the whole,
      Dunshunner, though it&rsquo;s letting them go dog-cheap, that we ought to sell
      half our shares at the present premium, while there is a certainty of
      getting it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not sell the whole? I&rsquo;m sure I have no objections to part with every
      stiver of the scrip on such terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;upon general principles you may be right; but then
      remember that we have a vested interest in the line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vested interest be hanged!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very well; at the same time it is no use to kill your salmon in a
      hurry. The bulls have done their work pretty well for us, and we ought to
      keep something on hand for the bears; they are snuffing at it already. I
      could almost swear that some of those fellows who have sold to-day are
      working for a time-bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We accordingly got rid of a couple of thousand shares, the proceeds of
      which not only enabled us to discharge the deposit loan, but left us a
      material surplus. Under these circumstances a two-handed banquet was
      proposed and unanimously carried, the commencement of which I distinctly
      remember, but am rather dubious as to the end. So many stories have lately
      been circulated to the prejudice of railway directors that I think it my
      duty to state that this entertainment was scrupulously defrayed by
      ourselves and <i>not</i> carried to account, either of the preliminary
      survey, or the expenses of the provisional committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing effects so great a metamorphosis in the bearing of the outer man
      as a sudden change of fortune. The anemone of the garden differs scarcely
      more from its unpretending prototype of the woods than Robert
      M&rsquo;Corkindale, Esq., Secretary and Projector of the Glenmutchkin Railway,
      differed from Bob M&rsquo;Corkindale, the seedy frequenter of &ldquo;The Crow.&rdquo; In the
      days of yore, men eyed the surtout&mdash;napless at the velvet collar, and
      preternaturally white at the seams&mdash;which Bob vouchsafed to wear with
      looks of dim suspicion, as if some faint reminiscence, similar to that
      which is said to recall the memory of a former state of existence,
      suggested to them a notion that the garment had once been their own.
      Indeed, his whole appearance was then wonderfully second-hand. Now he had
      cast his slough. A most undeniable taglioni, with trimmings just bordering
      upon frogs, gave dignity to his demeanour and twofold amplitude to his
      chest. The horn eye-glass was exchanged for one of purest gold, the dingy
      high-lows for well-waxed Wellingtons, the Paisley fogle for the fabric of
      the China loom. Moreover, he walked with a swagger, and affected in common
      conversation a peculiar dialect which he opined to be the purest English,
      but which no one&mdash;except a bagman&mdash;could be reasonably expected
      to understand. His pockets were invariably crammed with sharelists; and he
      quoted, if he did not comprehend, the money article from the &ldquo;Times.&rdquo; This
      sort of assumption, though very ludicrous in itself, goes down
      wonderfully. Bob gradually became a sort of authority, and his opinions
      got quoted on &lsquo;Change. He was no ass, notwithstanding his peculiarities,
      and made good use of his opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For myself, I bore my new dignities with an air of modest meekness. A
      certain degree of starchness is indispensable for a railway director, if
      he means to go forward in his high calling and prosper; he must abandon
      all juvenile eccentricities, and aim at the appearance of a decided enemy
      to free trade in the article of Wild Oats. Accordingly, as the first step
      toward respectability, I eschewed coloured waistcoats and gave out that I
      was a marrying man. No man under forty, unless he is a positive idiot,
      will stand forth as a theoretical bachelor. It is all nonsense to say that
      there is anything unpleasant in being courted. Attention, whether from
      male or female, tickles the vanity; and although I have a reasonable, and,
      I hope, not unwholesome regard for the gratification of my other
      appetites, I confess that this same vanity is by far the most poignant of
      the whole. I therefore surrendered myself freely to the soft allurements
      thrown in my way by such matronly denizens of Glasgow as were possessed of
      stock in the shape of marriageable daughters; and walked the more readily
      into their toils because every party, though nominally for the purposes of
      tea, wound up with a hot supper, and something hotter still by way of
      assisting the digestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t know whether it was my determined conduct at the allocation, my
      territorial title, or a most exaggerated idea of my circumstances, that
      worked upon the mind of Mr. Sawley. Possibly it was a combination of the
      three; but, sure enough few days had elapsed before I received a formal
      card of invitation to a tea and serous conversation. Now serious
      conversation is a sort of thing that I never shone in, possibly because my
      early studies were framed in a different direction; but as I really was
      unwilling to offend the respectable coffin-maker, and as I found that the
      Captain of M&rsquo;Alcohol&mdash;a decided trump in his way&mdash;had also
      received a summons, I notified my acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      M&rsquo;Alcohol and I went together. The captain, an enormous brawny Celt, with
      superhuman whiskers and a shock of the fieriest hair, had figged himself
      out, <i>more majorum</i>, in the full Highland costume. I never saw Rob
      Roy on the stage look half so dignified or ferocious. He glittered from
      head to foot with dirk, pistol, and skean-dhu; and at least a
      hundredweight of cairngorms cast a prismatic glory around his person. I
      felt quite abashed beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were ushered into Mr. Sawley&rsquo;s drawing-room. Round the walls, and at
      considerable distances from each other, were seated about a dozen
      characters, male and female, all of them dressed in sable, and wearing
      countenances of woe. Sawley advanced, and wrung me by the hand with so
      piteous an expression of visage that I could not help thinking some awful
      catastrophe had just befallen his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are welcome, Mr. Dunshunner&mdash;welcome to my humble tabernacle.
      Let me present you to Mrs. Sawley&rdquo;&mdash;and a lady, who seemed to have
      bathed in the Yellow Sea, rose from her seat, and favoured me with a
      profound curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter&mdash;Miss Selina Sawley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt in my brain the scorching glance of the two darkest eyes it ever
      was my fortune to behold, as the beauteous Selina looked up from the
      perusal of her handkerchief hem. It was a pity that the other features
      were not corresponding; for the nose was flat, and the mouth of such
      dimensions that a harlequin might have jumped down it with impunity; but
      the eyes <i>were</i> splendid.
    </p>
    <p>
      In obedience to a sign from the hostess, I sank into a chair beside
      Selina; and, not knowing exactly what to say, hazarded some observation
      about the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is indeed a suggestive season. How deeply, Mr. Dunshunner, we
      ought to feel the pensive progress of autumn toward a soft and premature
      decay! I always think, about this time of the year, that nature is falling
      into a consumption!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said I, rather taken aback by this style of colloquy,
      &ldquo;the trees are looking devilishly hectic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you have remarked that too! Strange! It was but yesterday that I was
      wandering through Kelvin Grove, and as the phantom breeze brought down the
      withered foliage from the spray, I thought how probable it was that they
      might ere long rustle over young and glowing hearts deposited prematurely
      in the tomb!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, which struck me as a very passable imitation of Dickens&rsquo;s pathetic
      writings, was a poser. In default of language, I looked Miss Sawley
      straight in the face, and attempted a substitute for a sigh. I was
      rewarded with a tender glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I see you are a congenial spirit! How delightful, and yet
      how rare, it is to meet with any one who thinks in unison with yourself!
      Do you ever walk in the Necropolis, Mr. Dunshunner? It is my favourite
      haunt of a morning. There we can wean ourselves, as it were, from life,
      and beneath the melancholy yew and cypress, anticipate the setting star.
      How often there have I seen the procession&mdash;the funeral of some very,
      <i>very</i> little child&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Selina, my love,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sawley, &ldquo;have the kindness to ring for the
      cookies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I, as in duty bound, started up to save the fair enthusiast the trouble,
      and was not sorry to observe my seat immediately occupied by a very
      cadaverous gentleman, who was evidently jealous of the progress I was
      rapidly making. Sawley, with an air of great mystery, informed me that
      this was a Mr. Dalgleish of Raxmathrapple, the representative of an
      ancient Scottish family who claimed an important heritable office. The
      name, I thought, was familiar to me, but there was something in the
      appearance of Mr. Dalgleish which, notwithstanding the smiles of Miss
      Selina, rendered a rivalship in that quarter utterly out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hate injustice, so let me do the honour in description to the Sawley
      banquet. The tea-urn most literally corresponded to its name. The table
      was decked out with divers platters, containing seed-cakes cut into
      rhomboids, almond biscuits, and ratafia-drops. Also on the sideboard there
      were two salvers, each of which contained a congregation of glasses,
      filled with port and sherry. The former fluid, as I afterward ascertained,
      was of the kind advertised as &ldquo;curious,&rdquo; and proffered for sale at the
      reasonable rate of sixteen shillings per dozen. The banquet, on the whole,
      was rather peculiar than enticing; and, for the life of me, I could not
      divest myself of the idea that the self-same viands had figured, not long
      before, as funeral refreshments at a dirgie. No such suspicion seemed to
      cross the mind of M&rsquo;Alcohol, who hitherto had remained uneasily surveying
      his nails in a corner, but at the first symptom of food started forward,
      and was in the act of making a clean sweep of the china, when Sawley
      proposed the singular preliminary of a hymn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hymn was accordingly sung. I am thankful to say it was such a one as I
      never heard before, or expect to hear again; and unless it was composed by
      the Reverend Saunders Peden in an hour of paroxysm on the moors, I cannot
      conjecture the author. After this original symphony, tea was discussed,
      and after tea, to my amazement, more hot brandy-and-water than I ever
      remember to have seen circulated at the most convivial party. Of course
      this effected a radical change in the spirits and conversation of the
      circle. It was again my lot to be placed by the side of the fascinating
      Selina, whose sentimentality gradually thawed away beneath the influence
      of sundry sips, which she accepted with a delicate reluctance. This time
      Dalgleish of Raxmathrapple had not the remotest chance. M&rsquo;Alcohol got
      furious, sang Gaelic songs, and even delivered a sermon in genuine Erse,
      without incurring a rebuke; while, for my own part, I must needs confess
      that I waxed unnecessarily amorous, and the last thing I recollect was the
      pressure of Mr. Sawley&rsquo;s hand at the door, as he denominated me his dear
      boy, and hoped I would soon come back and visit Mrs. Sawley and Selina.
      The recollection of these passages next morning was the surest antidote to
      my return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three weeks had elapsed, and still the Glenmutchkin Railway shares were at
      a premium, though rather lower than when we sold. Our engineer, Watty
      Solder, returned from his first survey of the line, along with an
      assistant who really appeared to have some remote glimmerings of the
      science and practice of mensuration. It seemed, from a verbal report, that
      the line was actually practicable; and the survey would have been
      completed in a very short time, &ldquo;if,&rdquo; according to the account of Solder,
      &ldquo;there had been ae hoos in the glen. But ever sin&rsquo; the distillery stoppit&mdash;and
      that was twa year last Martinmas&mdash;there wasna a hole whaur a
      Christian could lay his head, muckle less get white sugar to his toddy,
      forby the change-house at the clachan; and the auld lucky that keepit it
      was sair forfochten wi&rsquo; the palsy, and maist in the dead-thraws. There was
      naebody else living within twal&rsquo; miles o&rsquo; the line, barring a taxman, a
      lamiter, and a bauldie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had some difficulty in preventing Mr. Solder from making this report
      open and patent to the public, which premature disclosure might have
      interfered materially with the preparation of our traffic tables, not to
      mention the marketable value of the shares. We therefore kept him steadily
      at work out of Glasgow, upon a very liberal allowance, to which,
      apparently, he did not object.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunshunner,&rdquo; said M&rsquo;Corkindale to me one day, &ldquo;I suspect that there is
      something going on about our railway more than we are aware of. Have you
      observed that the shares are preternaturally high just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better. Let&rsquo;s sell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did so this morning, both yours and mine, at two pounds ten shillings
      premium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce you did! Then we&rsquo;re out of the whole concern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite. If my suspicions are correct, there&rsquo;s a good deal more money
      yet to be got from the speculation. Somebody had been bulling the stock
      without orders; and, as they can have no information which we are not
      perfectly up to, depend upon it, it is done for a purpose. I suspect
      Sawley and his friends. They have never been quite happy since the
      allocation; and I caught him yesterday pumping our broker in the back
      shop. We&rsquo;ll see in a day or two. If they are beginning a bearing
      operation, I know how to catch them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, in effect, the bearing operation commenced. Next day, heavy sales
      were effected for delivery in three weeks; and the stock, as if
      water-logged, began to sink. The same thing continued for the following
      two days, until the premium became nearly nominal. In the meantime, Bob
      and I, in conjunction with two leading capitalists whom we let into the
      secret, bought up steadily every share that was offered; and at the end of
      a fortnight we found that we had purchased rather more than double the
      amount of the whole original stock. Sawley and his disciples, who, as
      M&rsquo;Corkindale suspected, were at the bottom of the whole transaction,
      having beared to their hearts&rsquo; content, now came into the market to
      purchase, in order to redeem their engagements.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no means of knowing in what frame of mind Mr. Sawley spent the
      Sunday, or whether he had recourse for mental consolation to Peden; but on
      Monday morning he presented himself at my door in full funeral costume,
      with about a quarter of a mile of crape swathed round his hat, black
      gloves, and a countenance infinitely more doleful than if he had been
      attending the interment of his beloved wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walk in, Mr. Sawley,&rdquo; said I, cheerfully. &ldquo;What a long time it is since I
      have had the pleasure of seeing you&mdash;too long indeed for brother
      directors! How are Mrs. Sawley and Miss Selina? Won&rsquo;t you take a cup of
      coffee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grass, sir, grass!&rdquo; said Mr. Sawley, with a sigh like the groan of a
      furnace-bellows. &ldquo;We are all flowers of the oven&mdash;weak, erring
      creatures, every one of us. Ah, Mr. Dunshunner, you have been a great
      stranger at Lykewake Terrace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a muffin, Mr. Sawley. Anything new in the railway world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear sir,&mdash;my good Mr. Augustus Reginald,&mdash;I wanted to
      have some serious conversation with you on that very point. I am afraid
      there is something far wrong indeed in the present state of our stock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to be sure it is high; but that, you know, is a token of the public
      confidence in the line. After all, the rise is nothing compared to that of
      several English railways; and individually, I suppose, neither of us has
      any reason to complain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; said Sawley, watching me over the margin of his
      coffee-cup; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it. It savours too much of gambling for a man of
      my habits. Selina, who is a sensible girl, has serious qualms on the
      subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why not get out of it? I have no objection to run the risk, and if
      you like to transact with me, I will pay you ready money for every share
      you have at the present market price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sawley writhed uneasily in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you sell me five hundred, Mr. Sawley? Say the word and it is a
      bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A time-bargain?&rdquo; quavered the coffin-maker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Money down, and scrip handed over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t. The fact is, my dear young friend, I have sold all my
      stock already!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then permit me to ask, Mr. Sawley, what possible objection you can have
      to the present aspect of affairs? You do not surely suppose that we are
      going to issue new shares and bring down the market, simply because you
      have realised at a handsome premium?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A handsome premium! O Lord!&rdquo; moaned Sawley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what did you get for them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four, three, and two and a half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very considerable profit indeed,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and you ought to be
      abundantly thankful. We shall talk this matter over at another time, Mr.
      Sawley, but just now I must beg you to excuse me. I have a particular
      engagement this morning with my broker&mdash;rather a heavy transaction to
      settle&mdash;and so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use beating about the bush any longer,&rdquo; said Mr. Sawley, in an
      excited tone, at the same time dashing down his crape-covered castor on
      the floor. &ldquo;Did you ever see a ruined man with a large family? Look at me,
      Mr. Dunshunner&mdash;I&rsquo;m one, and you&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sawley! Are you in your senses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on circumstances. Haven&rsquo;t you been buying stock lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to say I have&mdash;two thousand Glenmutchkins, I think, and
      this is the day of delivery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, can&rsquo;t you see how the matter stands? It was I who sold them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother of Moses, sir! Don&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m ruined?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means&mdash;but you must not swear. I pay over the money for your
      scrip, and you pocket a premium. It seems to me a very simple
      transaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you I haven&rsquo;t got the scrip!&rdquo; cried Sawley, gnashing his
      teeth, while the cold beads of perspiration gathered largely on his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very unfortunate! Have you lost it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! the devil tempted me, and I oversold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a very long pause, during which I assumed an aspect of serious
      and dignified rebuke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; said I, in a low tone, after the manner of Kean&rsquo;s
      offended fathers. &ldquo;What! you, Mr. Sawley&mdash;the stoker&rsquo;s friend&mdash;the
      enemy of gambling&mdash;the father of Selina&mdash;condescend to so
      equivocal a transaction? You amaze me! But I never was the man to press
      heavily on a friend&rdquo;&mdash;here Sawley brightened up. &ldquo;Your secret is safe
      with me, and it shall be your own fault if it reaches the ears of the
      Session. Pay me over the difference at the present market price, and I
      release you of your obligation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m in the Gazette, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Sawley, doggedly, &ldquo;and a wife
      and nine beautiful babes upon the parish! I had hoped other things from
      you, Mr. Dunshunner&mdash;I thought you and Selina&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, man! Nobody goes into the Gazette just now&mdash;it will be
      time enough when the general crash comes. Out with your cheque-book, and
      write me an order for four and twenty thousand. Confound fractions! In
      these days one can afford to be liberal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got it,&rdquo; said Sawley. &ldquo;You have no idea how bad our trade has
      been of late, for nobody seems to think of dying. I have not sold a gross
      of coffins this fortnight. But I&rsquo;ll tell you what&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give you five
      thousand down in cash, and ten thousand in shares; further I can&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Sawley,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I may be blamed by worldly-minded persons for
      what I am going to do; but I am a man of principle, and feel deeply for
      the situation of your amiable wife and family. I bear no malice, though it
      is quite clear that you intended to make me the sufferer. Pay me fifteen
      thousand over the counter, and we cry quits for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you take the Camlachie Cemetery shares? They are sure to go up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve hundred Cowcaddens Water, with an issue of new stock next week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if they disseminated the Gauges!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand Ramshorn Gas&mdash;four per cent. guaranteed until the act?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if they promised twenty, and melted down the sun in their retort!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blawweary Iron? Best spec. going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I tell you once for all! If you don&rsquo;t like my offer,&mdash;and it is
      an uncommonly liberal one,&mdash;say so, and I&rsquo;ll expose you this
      afternoon upon &lsquo;Change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, there&rsquo;s a cheque. But may the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, sir! Any such profane expressions, and I shall insist upon the
      original bargain. So then, now we&rsquo;re quits. I wish you a very
      good-morning, Mr. Sawley, and better luck next time. Pray remember me to
      your amiable family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door had hardly closed upon the discomfited coffin-maker, and I was
      still in the preliminary steps of an extempore <i>pas seul</i>, intended
      as the outward demonstration of exceeding inward joy, when Bob
      M&rsquo;Corkindale entered. I told him the result of the morning&rsquo;s conference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have let him off too easily,&rdquo; said the political economist. &ldquo;Had I
      been his creditor, I certainly should have sacked the shares into the
      bargain. There is nothing like rigid dealing between man and man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am contented with moderate profits,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;besides, the image of
      Selina overcame me. How goes it with Jobson and Grabbie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jobson had paid, and Grabbie compounded. Heckles&mdash;may he die an evil
      death!&mdash;has repudiated, become a lame duck, and waddled; but no doubt
      his estate will pay a dividend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So then, we are clear of the whole Glenmutchkin business, and at a
      handsome profit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fair interest for the outlay of capital&mdash;nothing more. But I&rsquo;m not
      quite done with the concern yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so? not another bearing operation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; that cock would hardly fight. But you forget that I am secretary to
      the company, and have a small account against them for services already
      rendered. I must do what I can to carry the bill through Parliament; and,
      as you have now sold your whole shares, I advise you to resign from the
      direction, go down straight to Glenmutchkin, and qualify yourself for a
      witness. We shall give you five guineas a day, and pay all your expenses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bad notion. But what has become of M&rsquo;Closkie, and the other fellow
      with the jaw-breaking name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vich-Induibh? I have looked after their interests as in duty bound, sold
      their shares at a large premium, and despatched them to their native hills
      on annuities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Sir Polloxfen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Died yesterday of spontaneous combustion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the company seemed breaking up, I thought I could not do better than
      take M&rsquo;Corkindale&rsquo;s hint, and accordingly betook myself to Glenmutchkin,
      along with the Captain of M&rsquo;Alcohol, and we quartered ourselves upon the
      Factor for Glentumblers. We found Watty Solder very shaky, and his
      assistant also lapsing into habits of painful inebriety. We saw little of
      them except of an evening, for we shot and fished the whole day, and made
      ourselves remarkably comfortable. By singular good luck, the plans and
      sections were lodged in time, and the Board of Trade very handsomely
      reported in our favour, with a recommendation of what they were pleased to
      call &ldquo;the Glenmutchkin system,&rdquo; and a hope that it might generally be
      carried out. What this system was, I never clearly understood; but, of
      course, none of us had any objections. This circumstance gave an
      additional impetus to the shares, and they once more went up. I was,
      however, too cautious to plunge a second time in to Charybdis, but
      M&rsquo;Corkindale did, and again emerged with plunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time came for the parliamentary contest, we all emigrated to
      London. I still recollect, with lively satisfaction, the many pleasant
      days we spent in the metropolis at the company&rsquo;s expense. There were just
      a neat fifty of us, and we occupied the whole of a hotel. The discussion
      before the committee was long and formidable. We were opposed by four
      other companies who patronised lines, of which the nearest was at least a
      hundred miles distant from Glenmutchkin; but as they founded their
      opposition upon dissent from &ldquo;the Glenmutchkin system&rdquo; generally, the
      committee allowed them to be heard. We fought for three weeks a most
      desperate battle, and might in the end have been victorious, had not our
      last antagonist, at the very close of his case, pointed out no less than
      seventy-three fatal errors in the parliamentary plan deposited by the
      unfortunate Solder. Why this was not done earlier, I never exactly
      understood; it may be that our opponents, with gentlemanly consideration,
      were unwilling to curtail our sojourn in London&mdash;and their own. The
      drama was now finally closed, and after all preliminary expenses were
      paid, sixpence per share was returned to the holders upon surrender of
      their scrip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is an accurate history of the Origin, Rise, Progress, and Fall of the
      Direct Glenmutchkin Railway. It contains a deep moral, if anybody has
      sense enough to see it; if not, I have a new project in my eye for next
      session, of which timely notice shall be given.

    <h2>
      THRAWN JANET, By Robert Louis Stevenson
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Reverend Murdoch Soulis was long minister of the moorland parish of
      Balweary, in the vale of Dule. A severe, bleak-faced old man, dreadful to
      his hearers, he dwelt in the last years of his life, without relative or
      servant or any human company, in the small and lonely manse under the
      Hanging Shaw. In spite of the iron composure of his features, his eye was
      wild, scared, and uncertain; and when he dwelt, in private admonitions, on
      the future of the impenitent, it seemed as if his eye pierced through the
      storms of time to the terrors of eternity. Many young persons, coming to
      prepare themselves against the season of the holy communion, were
      dreadfully affected by his talk. He had a sermon on I Pet. V. 8, &ldquo;The
      devil as a roaring lion,&rdquo; on the Sunday after every 17th of August, and he
      was accustomed to surpass himself upon that text both by the appalling
      nature of the matter and the terror of his bearing in the pulpit. The
      children were frightened into fits, and the old looked more than usually
      oracular, and were, all that day, full of those hints that Hamlet
      deprecated. The manse itself, where it stood by the water of Dule among
      some thick trees, with the Shaw overhanging it on the one side, and on the
      other many cold, moorish hilltops rising toward the sky, had begun, at a
      very early period of Mr. Soulis&rsquo;s ministry, to be avoided in the dusk
      hours by all who valued themselves upon their prudence; and guidmen
      sitting at the clachan alehouse shook their heads together at the thought
      of passing late by that uncanny neighbourhood. There was one spot, to be
      more particular, which was regarded with especial awe. The manse stood
      between the highroad and the water of Dule, with a gable to each; its bank
      was toward the kirktown of Balweary, nearly half a mile away; in front of
      it, a bare garden, hedged with thorn, occupied the land between the river
      and the road. The house was two stories high, with two large rooms on
      each. It opened not directly on the garden, but on a causewayed path, or
      passage, giving on the road on the one hand, and closed on the other by
      the tall willows and elders that bordered on the stream. And it was this
      strip of causeway that enjoyed among the young parishioners of Balweary so
      infamous a reputation. The minister walked there often after dark,
      sometimes groaning aloud in the instancy of his unspoken prayers; and when
      he was from home, and the manse door was locked, the more daring
      school-boys ventured, with beating hearts, to &ldquo;follow my leader&rdquo; across
      that legendary spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      This atmosphere of terror, surrounding, as it did, a man of God of
      spotless character and orthodoxy, was a common cause of wonder and subject
      of inquiry among the few strangers who were led by chance or business into
      that unknown, outlying country. But many even of the people of the parish
      were ignorant of the strange events which had marked the first year of Mr.
      Soulis&rsquo;s ministrations; and among those who were better informed, some
      were naturally reticent, and others shy of that particular topic. Now and
      again, only, one of the older folk would warm into courage over his third
      tumbler, and recount the cause of the minister&rsquo;s strange looks and
      solitary life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifty years syne, when Mr. Soulis cam&rsquo; first into Ba&rsquo;weary, he was still a
      young man,&mdash;a callant, the folk said,&mdash;fu&rsquo; o&rsquo; book-learnin&rsquo; and
      grand at the exposition, but, as was natural in sae young a man, wi&rsquo; nae
      leevin&rsquo; experience in religion. The younger sort were greatly taken wi&rsquo; 
      his gifts and his gab; but auld, concerned, serious men and women were
      moved even to prayer for the young man, whom they took to be a
      self-deceiver, and the parish that was like to be sae ill supplied. It was
      before the days o&rsquo; the Moderates&mdash;weary fa&rsquo; them; but ill things are
      like guid&mdash;they baith come bit by bit, a pickle at a time; and there
      were folk even then that said the Lord had left the college professors to
      their ain devices, an&rsquo; the lads that went to study wi&rsquo; them wad hae done
      mair and better sittin&rsquo; in a peat-bog, like their forebears of the
      persecution, wi&rsquo; a Bible under their oxter and a speerit o&rsquo; prayer in
      their heart. There was nae doubt, onyway, but that Mr. Soulis had been
      ower-lang at the college. He was careful and troubled for mony things
      besides the ae thing needful. He had a feck o&rsquo; books wi&rsquo; him&mdash;mair
      than had ever been seen before in a&rsquo; that presbytery; and a sair wark the
      carrier had wi&rsquo; them, for they were a&rsquo; like to have smoored in the Deil&rsquo;s
      Hag between this and Kilmackerlie. They were books o&rsquo; divinity, to be
      sure, or so they ca&rsquo;d them; but the serious were o&rsquo; opinion there was
      little service for sae mony, when the hail o&rsquo; God&rsquo;s Word would gang in the
      neuk of a plaid. Then he wad sit half the day and half the nicht forby,
      which was scant decent&mdash;writin&rsquo;, nae less; and first they were feard
      he wad read his sermons; and syne it proved he was writin&rsquo; a book himsel&rsquo;,
      which was surely no fittin&rsquo; for ane of his years an&rsquo; sma&rsquo; experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Onyway, it behooved him to get an auld, decent wife to keep the manse for
      him an&rsquo; see to his bit denners; and he was recommended to an auld limmer,&mdash;Janet
      M&rsquo;Clour, they ca&rsquo;d her,&mdash;and sae far left to himsel&rsquo; as to be
      ower-persuaded. There was mony advised him to the contrar&rsquo;, for Janet was
      mair than suspeckit by the best folk in Ba&rsquo;weary. Lang or that, she had
      had a wean to a dragoon; she hadnae come forrit for maybe thretty year;
      and bairns had seen her mumblin&rsquo; to hersel&rsquo; up on Key&rsquo;s Loan in the
      gloamin&rsquo;, whilk was an unco time an&rsquo; place for a God-fearin&rsquo; woman.
      Howsoever, it was the laird himsel&rsquo; that had first tauld the minister o&rsquo; 
      Janet; and in thae days he wad have gane a far gate to pleesure the laird.
      When folk tauld him that Janet was sib to the deil, it was a&rsquo; superstition
      by his way of it; and&rsquo; when they cast up the Bible to him, an&rsquo; the witch
      of Endor, he wad threep it doun their thrapples that thir days were a&rsquo; 
      gane by, and the deil was mercifully restrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weel, when it got about the clachan that Janet M&rsquo;Clour was to be servant
      at the manse, the folk were fair mad wi&rsquo; her an&rsquo; him thegether; and some
      o&rsquo; the guidwives had nae better to dae than get round her door-cheeks and
      chairge her wi&rsquo; a&rsquo; that was kent again&rsquo; her, frae the sodger&rsquo;s bairn to
      John Tamson&rsquo;s twa kye. She was nae great speaker; folk usually let her
      gang her ain gait, an&rsquo; she let them gang theirs, wi&rsquo; neither fair
      guid-e&rsquo;en nor fair guid-day; but when she buckled to, she had a tongue to
      deave the miller. Up she got, an&rsquo; there wasnae an auld story in Ba&rsquo;weary
      but she gart somebody lowp for it that day; they couldnae say ae thing but
      she could say twa to it; till, at the hinder end, the guidwives up and
      claught haud of her, and clawed the coats aff her back, and pu&rsquo;d her doun
      the clachan to the water o&rsquo; Dule, to see if she were a witch or no, soum
      or droun. The carline skirled till ye could hear her at the Hangin&rsquo; Shaw,
      and she focht like ten; there was mony a guid wife bure the mark of her
      neist day an&rsquo; mony a lang day after; and just in the hettest o&rsquo; the
      collieshangie, wha suld come up (for his sins) but the new minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women,&rdquo; said he (and he had a grand voice), &ldquo;I charge you in the Lord&rsquo;s
      name to let her go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Janet ran to him&mdash;she was fair wud wi&rsquo; terror&mdash;an&rsquo; clang to him,
      an&rsquo; prayed him, for Christ&rsquo;s sake, save her frae the cummers; an&rsquo; they,
      for their pairt, tauld him a&rsquo; that was kent, and maybe mair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; says he to Janet, &ldquo;is this true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As the Lord sees me,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;as the Lord made me, no a word o&rsquo; &lsquo;t.
      Forby the bairn,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a decent woman a&rsquo; my days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you,&rdquo; says Mr. Soulis, &ldquo;in the name of God, and before me, His
      unworthy minister, renounce the devil and his works?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Weel, it wad appear that, when he askit that, she gave a girn that fairly
      frichtit them that saw her, an&rsquo; they could hear her teeth play dirl
      thegether in her chafts; but there was naething for it but the ae way or
      the ither; an&rsquo; Janet lifted up her hand and renounced the deil before them
      a&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; says Mr. Soulis to the guidwives, &ldquo;home with ye, one and all,
      and pray to God for His forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he gied Janet his arm, though she had little on her but a sark, and
      took her up the clachan to her ain door like a leddy of the land, an&rsquo; her
      scrieghin&rsquo; and laughin&rsquo; as was a scandal to be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were mony grave folk lang ower their prayers that nicht; but when
      the morn cam&rsquo; there was sic a fear fell upon a&rsquo; Ba&rsquo;weary that the bairns
      hid theirsel&rsquo;s, and even the men folk stood and keekit frae their doors.
      For there was Janet comin&rsquo; doun the clachan,&mdash;her or her likeness,
      nane could tell,&mdash;wi&rsquo; her neck thrawn, and her heid on ae side, like
      a body that has been hangit, and a girn on her face like an unstreakit
      corp. By-an&rsquo;-by they got used wi&rsquo; it, and even speered at her to ken what
      was wrang; but frae that day forth she couldnae speak like a Christian
      woman, but slavered and played click wi&rsquo; her teeth like a pair o&rsquo; shears;
      and frae that day forth the name o&rsquo; God cam&rsquo; never on her lips. Whiles she
      wad try to say it, but it michtnae be. Them that kenned best said least;
      but they never gied that Thing the name o&rsquo; Janet M&rsquo;Clour; for the auld
      Janet, by their way o&rsquo; &lsquo;t, was in muckle hell that day. But the minister
      was neither to haud nor to bind; he preached about naething but the folk&rsquo;s
      cruelty that had gien her a stroke of the palsy; he skelpt the bairns that
      meddled her; and he had her up to the manse that same nicht, and dwalled
      there a&rsquo; his lane wi&rsquo; her under the Hangin&rsquo; Shaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weel, time gaed by, and the idler sort commenced to think mair lichtly o&rsquo; 
      that black business. The minister was weel thocht o&rsquo;; he was aye late at
      the writing&mdash;folk wad see his can&rsquo;le doon by the Dule Water after
      twal&rsquo; at e&rsquo;en; and he seemed pleased wi&rsquo; himsel&rsquo; and upsitten as at first,
      though a&rsquo; body could see that he was dwining. As for Janet, she cam&rsquo; an&rsquo; 
      she gaed; if she didnae speak muckle afore, it was reason she should speak
      less then; she meddled naebody; but she was an eldritch thing to see, an&rsquo; 
      nane wad hae mistrysted wi&rsquo; her for Ba&rsquo;weary glebe.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the end o&rsquo; July there cam&rsquo; a spell o&rsquo; weather, the like o&rsquo; &lsquo;t never
      was in that countryside; it was lown an&rsquo; het an&rsquo; heartless; the herds
      couldnae win up the Black Hill, the bairns were ower-weariet to play; an&rsquo; 
      yet it was gousty too, wi&rsquo; claps o&rsquo; het wund that rummled in the glens,
      and bits o&rsquo; shouers that slockened naething. We aye thocht it but to
      thun&rsquo;er on the morn; but the morn cam&rsquo;, an&rsquo; the morn&rsquo;s morning, and it was
      aye the same uncanny weather; sair on folks and bestial. Of a&rsquo; that were
      the waur, nane suffered like Mr. Soulis; he could neither sleep nor eat,
      he tauld his elders; an&rsquo; when he wasnae writin&rsquo; at his weary book, he wad
      be stravaguin&rsquo; ower a&rsquo; the country-side like a man possessed, when a&rsquo; body
      else was blithe to keep caller ben the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abune Hangin&rsquo; Shaw, in the bield o&rsquo; the Black Hill, there&rsquo;s a bit enclosed
      grund wi&rsquo; an iron yert; and it seems, in the auld days, that was the
      kirkyaird o&rsquo; Ba&rsquo;weary, and consecrated by the papists before the blessed
      licht shone upon the kingdom. It was a great howff, o&rsquo; Mr. Soulis&rsquo;s
      onyway; there he would sit an&rsquo; consider his sermons&rsquo; and inded it&rsquo;s a
      bieldy bit. Weel, as he came ower the wast end o&rsquo; the Black Hill, ae day,
      he saw first twa, an&rsquo; syne fower, an&rsquo; syne seeven corbie craws fleein&rsquo; 
      round an&rsquo; round abune the auld kirkyaird. They flew laigh and heavy, an&rsquo; 
      squawked to ither as they gaed; and it was clear to Mr. Soulis that
      something had put them frae their ordinar. He wasna easy fleyed, an&rsquo; gaed
      straucht up to the wa&rsquo;s; and what suld he find there but a man, or the
      appearance of a man, sittin&rsquo; in the inside upon a grave. He was of a great
      stature, an&rsquo; black as hell, and his een were singular to see. Mr. Soulis
      had heard tell o&rsquo; black men, mony&rsquo;s the time; but there was something unco
      abut this black man that daunted him. Het as he was, he took a kind o&rsquo; 
      cauld grue in the marrow o&rsquo; his banes; but up he spak&rsquo; for a&rsquo; that; an&rsquo; 
      says he, &ldquo;My friend, are you a stranger in this place?&rdquo; The black man
      answered never a word; he got upon his feet, an&rsquo; begude to hirsel to the
      wa&rsquo; on the far side; but he aye lookit at the minister; an&rsquo; the minister
      stood an&rsquo; lookit back; till a&rsquo; in a meenute the black man was ower the wa&rsquo; 
      an&rsquo; rinnin&rsquo; for the bield o&rsquo; the trees. Mr. Soulis, he hardly kenned why,
      ran after him; but he was sair forjaskit wi&rsquo; his walk an&rsquo; the het,
      unhalesome weather; and rin as he likit, he got nae mair than a glisk o&rsquo; 
      the black man amang the birks, till he won doun to the foot o&rsquo; the
      hillside, an&rsquo; there he saw him ance mair, gaun, hap, step, an&rsquo; lowp, ower
      Dule Water to the manse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Soulis wasna weel pleased that this fearsome gangrel suld mak&rsquo; sae
      free wi&rsquo; Ba&rsquo;weary manse; an&rsquo; he ran the harder, an&rsquo; wet shoon, ower the
      burn, an&rsquo; up the walk; but the deil a black man was there to see. He
      stepped out upon the road, but there was naebody there; he gaed a&rsquo; ower
      the gairden, but na, nae black man. At the hinder end, and a bit feard as
      was but natural, he lifted the hasp and into the manse; and there was
      Janet M&rsquo;Clour before his een, wi&rsquo; her thrawn craig, and nane sae pleased
      to see him. And he aye minded sinsyne, when first he set his een upon her,
      he had the same cauld and deidy grue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Janet,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;have you seen a black man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A black man?&rdquo; quo&rsquo; she. &ldquo;Save us a&rsquo;! Ye &lsquo;re no wise, minister. There&rsquo;s
      nae black man in a&rsquo; Ba&rsquo;weary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she didna speak plain, ye maun understand; but yam-yammered, like a
      powny wi&rsquo; the bit in its moo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;Janet, if there was nae black man, I have spoken with
      the Accuser of the Brethren.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he sat down like ane wi&rsquo; a fever, an&rsquo; his teeth chittered in his heid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoots!&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;think shame to yoursel&rsquo;, minister,&rdquo; an&rsquo; gied him a
      drap brandy that she keept aye by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Syne Mr. Soulis gaed into his study amang a&rsquo; his books. It&rsquo;s a lang,
      laigh, mirk chalmer, perishin&rsquo; cauld in winter, an&rsquo; no very dry even in
      the top o&rsquo; the simmer, for the manse stands near the burn. Sae doun he
      sat, and thocht of a&rsquo; that had come an&rsquo; gane since he was in Ba&rsquo;weary, an&rsquo; 
      his hame, an&rsquo; the days when he was a bairn an&rsquo; ran daffin&rsquo; on the braes;
      and that black man aye ran in his heid like the owercome of a sang. Aye
      the mair he thocht, the mair he thocht o&rsquo; the black man. He tried the
      prayer, an&rsquo; the words wouldnae come to him; an&rsquo; he tried, they say, to
      write at his book, but he couldnae mak&rsquo; nae mair o&rsquo; that. There was whiles
      he thocht the black man was at his oxter, an&rsquo; the swat stood upon him
      cauld as well-water; and there was other whiles when he cam&rsquo; to himsel&rsquo; 
      like a christened bairn and minded naething.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upshot was that he gaed to the window an&rsquo; stood glowrin&rsquo; at Dule
      Water. The trees are unco thick, an&rsquo; the water lies deep an&rsquo; black under
      the manse; and there was Janet washing&rsquo; the cla&rsquo;es wi&rsquo; her coats kilted.
      She had her back to the minister, an&rsquo; he for his pairt, hardly kenned what
      he was lookin&rsquo; at. Syne she turned round, an&rsquo; shawed her face; Mr. Soulis
      had the same cauld grue as twice that day afore, an&rsquo; it was borne in upon
      him what folk said, that Janet was deid lang syne, an&rsquo; this was a bogle in
      her clay-cauld flesh. He drew back a pickle and he scanned her narrowly.
      She was tramp-trampin&rsquo; in the cla&rsquo;es, croonin&rsquo; to hersel&rsquo;; and eh! Gude
      guide us, but it was a fearsome face. Whiles she sang louder, but there
      was nae man born o&rsquo; woman that could tell the words o&rsquo; her sang; an&rsquo; 
      whiles she lookit sidelang doun, but there was naething there for her to
      look at. There gaed a scunner through the flesh upon his banes; and that
      was Heeven&rsquo;s advertisement. But Mr. Soulis just blamed himsel&rsquo;, he said,
      to think sae ill of a puir auld afflicted wife that hadnae a freend forby
      himsel&rsquo;; an&rsquo; he put up a bit prayer for him an&rsquo; her, an&rsquo; drank a little
      caller water,&mdash;for his heart rose again&rsquo; the meat,&mdash;an&rsquo; gaed up
      to his naked bed in the gloaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a nicht that has never been forgotten in Ba&rsquo;weary, the nicht o&rsquo; 
      the seeventeenth of August, seventeen hun&rsquo;er&rsquo; an&rsquo; twal&rsquo;. It had been het
      afore, as I hae said, but that nicht it was hetter than ever. The sun gaed
      doun amang unco-lookin&rsquo; clouds; it fell as mirk as the pit; no a star, no
      a breath o&rsquo; wund; ye couldnae see your han&rsquo; afore your face, and even the
      auld folk cuist the covers frae their beds and lay pechin&rsquo; for their
      breath. Wi&rsquo; a&rsquo; that he had upon his mind, it was gey and unlikely Mr.
      Soulis wad get muckle sleep. He lay an&rsquo; he tummled; the gude, caller bed
      that he got into brunt his very banes; whiles he slept, and whiles he
      waukened; whiles he heard the time o&rsquo; nicht, and whiles a tike yowlin&rsquo; up
      the muir, as if somebody was deid; whiles he thocht he heard bogles
      claverin&rsquo; in his lug, an&rsquo; whiles he saw spunkies in the room. He behooved,
      he judged, to be sick; an&rsquo; sick he was&mdash;little he jaloosed the
      sickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the hinder end, he got a clearness in his mind, sat up in his sark on
      the bedside, and fell thinkin&rsquo; ance mair o&rsquo; the black man an&rsquo; Janet. He
      couldnae weel tell how,&mdash;maybe it was the cauld to his feet,&mdash;but
      it cam&rsquo; in upon him wi&rsquo; a spate that there was some connection between
      thir twa, an&rsquo; that either or baith o&rsquo; them were bogles. And just at that
      moment, in Janet&rsquo;s room, which was neist to his, there cam&rsquo; a stamp o&rsquo; 
      feet as if men were wars&rsquo;lin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; then a loud bang; an&rsquo; then a wund gaed
      reishling round the fower quarters of the house; an&rsquo; then a&rsquo; was ance mair
      as seelent as the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Soulis was feard for neither man nor deevil. He got his tinder-box,
      an&rsquo; lit a can&rsquo;le, an&rsquo; made three steps o&rsquo; &lsquo;t ower to Janet&rsquo;s door. It was
      on the hasp, an&rsquo; he pushed it open, an&rsquo; keeked bauldly in. It was a big
      room, as big as the minister&rsquo;s ain, an&rsquo; plenished wi&rsquo; grand, auld, solid
      gear, for he had naething else. There was a fower-posted bed wi&rsquo; auld
      tapestry; and a braw cabinet of aik, that was fu&rsquo; o&rsquo; the minister&rsquo;s
      divinity books, an&rsquo; put there to be out o&rsquo; the gate; an&rsquo; a wheen duds o&rsquo; 
      Janet&rsquo;s lying here and there about the floor. But nae Janet could Mr.
      Soulis see, nor ony sign of a contention. In he gaed (an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s few that
      wad hae followed him), an&rsquo; lookit a&rsquo; round, an&rsquo; listened. But there was
      naethin&rsquo; to be heard neither inside the manse nor in a&rsquo; Ba&rsquo;weary parish,
      an&rsquo; naethin&rsquo; to be seen but the muckle shadows turnin&rsquo; round the can&rsquo;le.
      An&rsquo; then a&rsquo; at aince the minister&rsquo;s heart played dunt an&rsquo; stood
      stock-still, an&rsquo; a cauld wund blew amang the hairs o&rsquo; his heid. Whaten a
      weary sicht was that for the puir man&rsquo;s een! For there was Janet hangin&rsquo; 
      frae a nail beside the auld aik cabinet; her heid aye lay on her shouther,
      her een were steeked, the tongue projecket frae her mouth, and her heels
      were twa feet clear abune the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forgive us all!&rdquo; thocht Mr. Soulis, &ldquo;poor Janet&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He cam&rsquo; a step nearer to the corp; an&rsquo; then his heart fair whammled in his
      inside. For&mdash;by what cantrip it wad ill beseem a man to judge&mdash;she
      was hingin&rsquo; frae a single nail an&rsquo; by a single wursted thread for darnin&rsquo; 
      hose.
    </p>
    <p>
      It&rsquo;s an awfu&rsquo; thing to be your lane at nicht wi&rsquo; siccan prodigies o&rsquo; 
      darkness; but Mr. Soulis was strong in the Lord. He turned an&rsquo; gaed his
      ways oot o&rsquo; that room, and locket the door ahint him; and step by step
      doon the stairs, as heavy as leed; and set doon the can&rsquo;le on the table at
      the stair-foot. He couldnae pray, he couldnae think, he was dreepin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; 
      caul&rsquo; swat, an&rsquo; naething could he hear but the dunt-dunt-duntin&rsquo; o&rsquo; his
      ain heart. He micht maybe have stood there an hour, or maybe twa, he
      minded sae little; when a&rsquo; o&rsquo; a sudden he heard a laigh, uncanny steer
      upstairs; a foot gaed to an&rsquo; fro in the cham&rsquo;er whair the corp was
      hingin&rsquo;; syne the door was opened, though he minded weel that he had
      lockit it; an&rsquo; syne there was a step upon the landin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; it seemed to
      him as if the corp was lookin&rsquo; ower the tail and doun upon him whaur he
      stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up the can&rsquo;le again (for he couldnae want the licht), and, as
      saftly as ever he could, gaed straucht out o&rsquo; the manse an&rsquo; to the far end
      o&rsquo; the causeway. It was aye pit-mirk; the flame o&rsquo; the can&rsquo;le, when he set
      it on the grund, brunt steedy and clear as in a room; naething moved, but
      the Dule Water seepin&rsquo; and sabbin&rsquo; doon the glen, an&rsquo; yon unhaly footstep
      that cam&rsquo; plodding&rsquo; doun the stairs inside the manse. He kenned the foot
      ower-weel, for it was Janet&rsquo;s; and at ilka step that cam&rsquo; a wee thing
      nearer, the cauld got deeper in his vitals. He commended his soul to Him
      that made an&rsquo; keepit him; &ldquo;and, O Lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;give me strength this
      night to war against the powers of evil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the foot was comin&rsquo; through the passage for the door; he
      could hear a hand skirt alang the wa&rsquo;, as if the fearsome thing was
      feelin&rsquo; for its way. The saughs tossed an&rsquo; maned thegether, a long sigh
      cam&rsquo; ower the hills, the flame o&rsquo; the can&rsquo;le was blawn aboot; an&rsquo; there
      stood the corp of Thrawn Janet, wi&rsquo; her grogram goun an&rsquo; her black mutch,
      wi&rsquo; the heid aye upon the shouther, an&rsquo; the girn still upon the face o&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;t,&mdash;leevin&rsquo;, ye wad hae said&mdash;deid, as Mr. Soulis weel kenned,&mdash;upon
      the threshold o&rsquo; the manse.
    </p>
    <p>
      It&rsquo;s a strange thing that the saul of man should be thirled into his
      perishable body; but the minister saw that, an&rsquo; his heart didnae break.
    </p>
    <p>
      She didnae stand there lang; she began to move again, an&rsquo; cam&rsquo; slowly
      toward Mr. Soulis whaur he stood under the saughs. A&rsquo; the life o&rsquo; his
      body, a&rsquo; the strength o&rsquo; his speerit, were glowerin&rsquo; frae his een. It
      seemed she was gaun to speak, but wanted words, an&rsquo; made a sign wi&rsquo; the
      left hand. There cam&rsquo; a clap o&rsquo; wund, like a cat&rsquo;s fuff; oot gaed the
      can&rsquo;le, the saughs skrieghed like folk&rsquo; an&rsquo; Mr. Soulis kenned that, live
      or die, this was the end o&rsquo; &lsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Witch, beldam, devil!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I charge you, by the power of God,
      begone&mdash;if you be dead, to the grave; if you be damned, to hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An&rsquo; at that moment the Lord&rsquo;s ain hand out o&rsquo; the heevens struck the
      Horror whaur it stood; the auld, deid, desecrated corp o&rsquo; the witch-wife,
      sae lang keepit frae the grave and hirselled round by deils, lowed up like
      a brunstane spunk and fell in ashes to the grund; the thunder followed,
      peal on dirling peal, the rairing rain upon the back o&rsquo; that; and Mr.
      Soulis lowped through the garden hedge, and ran, wi&rsquo; skelloch upon
      skelloch, for the clachan.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same mornin&rsquo; John Christie saw the black man pass the Muckle Cairn as
      it was chappin&rsquo; six; before eicht, he gaed by the change-house at
      Knockdow; an&rsquo; no lang after, Sandy M&rsquo;Lellan saw him gaun linkin&rsquo; doun the
      braes frae Kilmackerlie. There&rsquo;s little doubt but it was him that dwalled
      sae lang in Janet&rsquo;s body; but he was awa&rsquo; at last; and sinsyne the deil
      has never fashed us in Ba&rsquo;weary.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was a sair dispensation for the minister; lang, lang he lay ravin&rsquo; 
      in his bed; and frae that hour to this, he was the man ye ken the day.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
