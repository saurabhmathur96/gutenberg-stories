THE ECONOMICAL PAIR
BY CAROLYN WELLS
Once on a Time there was a Man and his Wife who had Different Ideas
concerning Family Expenditures.
The Man said: "I am Exceedingly Economical; although I spend Small Sums
here and there for Cigars, Wines, Theater Tickets, and Little Dinners,
yet I do not buy me a Yacht or a Villa at Newport."
But even with these Praiseworthy Principles, it soon Came About that the
Man was Bankrupt.
Whereupon he Reproached his Wife, who Answered his Accusations with
Surprise.
"Me! My dear!" she exclaimed. "Why, I am Exceedingly Economical. True, I
Occasionally buy me a Set of Sables or a Diamond Tiara, but I am
Scrupulously Careful about Small Sums; I Diligently unknot all Strings
that come around Parcels, and Save Them, and I use the Backs of old
Envelopes for Scribbling-Paper. Yet, somehow, my Bank-Account is also
Exhausted."
MORALS:
This Fable teaches to Takes Care of the Pence and the Pounds will Take
Care of Themselves, and that we Should Not Be Penny-Wise and
Pound-Foolish.
