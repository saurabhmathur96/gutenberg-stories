CÆSAR'S QUIET LUNCH WITH CICERO
BY JAMES T. FIELDS

Have you read how Julius Cæsar
Made a call on Cicero
In his modest Formian villa,
Many and many a year ago?

"I shall pass your way," wrote Cæsar,
"On the Saturnalia, Third,
And I'll just drop in, my Tullius,
For a quiet friendly word:

"Don't make a stranger of me, Marc,
Nor be at all put out,
A snack of anything you have
Will serve my need, no doubt.

"I wish to show my confidence—
The invitation's mine—
I come to share your simple food,
And taste your honest wine."

Up rose M. Tullius Cicero,
And seized a Roman punch,—
Then mused upon the god-like soul
Was coming round to lunch.

"By Hercules!" he murmured low
Unto his lordly self,
"There are not many dainties left
Upon my pantry shelf!

"But what I have shall Julius share.
What, ho!" he proudly cried,
"Great Cæsar comes this way anon
To sit my chair beside.

"A dish of lampreys quickly stew,
And cook them with a turn,
For that's his favorite pabulum
From Mamurra I learn."

His slaves obey their lord's command;
The table soon is laid
For two distinguished gentlemen,—
One rather bald, 'tis said.

When lo! a messenger appears
To sound approach—and then,
"Brave Cæsar comes to greet his friend
With twice a thousand men!

"His cohorts rend the air with shouts;
That is their dust you see;
The trumpeters announce him near!"
Said Marcus, "Woe is me!

"Fly, Cassius, fly! assign a guard!
Borrow what tents you can!
Encamp his soldiers round the field,
Or I'm a ruined man!

"Get sheep and oxen by the score!
Buy corn at any price!
O Jupiter! befriend me now,
And give me your advice!"

         *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *

It turned out better than he feared,—
Things proved enough and good,—
And Cæsar made himself at home,
And much enjoyed his food.

But Marcus had an awful fright,—
That can not be denied;
"I'm glad 'tis over!"—when it was—
The host sat down and sighed,

And when he wrote to Atticus,
And all the story told,
He ended his epistle thus:
"J.C.'s a warrior bold,

"A vastly entertaining man,
In Learning quite immense,
So full of literary skill,
And most uncommon sense,

"But, frankly, I should never say
'No trouble, sir, at all;
And when you pass this way again,
Give us another call!'"
