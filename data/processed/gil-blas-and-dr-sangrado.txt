GIL BLAS AND DR. SANGRADO By Alain Rene Le Sage
    

      As I was on my way, who should come across me but Dr. Sangrado, whom I had
      not seen since the day of my master’s death. I took the liberty of
      touching my hat. He knew me in a twinkling.
    

      “Heyday!” said he, with as much warmth as his temperament
      would allow him, “the very lad I wanted to see; you have never been
      out of my thought. I have occasion for a clever fellow about me, and
      pitched upon you as the very thing, if you can read and write.”
    

      “Sir,” replied I, “if that is all you require, I am your
      man.”
    

      “In that case,” rejoined he, “we need look no further.
      Come home with me; you will be very comfortable; I shall behave to you
      like a brother. You will have no wages, but everything will be found you.
      You shall eat and drink according to the true scientific system, and be
      taught to cure all diseases. In a word, you shall rather be my young
      Sangrado than my footman.”
    

      I closed in with the doctor’s proposal, in the hope of becoming an
      Esculapius under so inspired a master. He carried me home forthwith, to
      install me in my honorable employment; which honorable employment
      consisted in writing down the name and residence of the patients who sent
      for him in his absence. There had indeed been a register for this purpose,
      kept by an old domestic; but she had not the gift of spelling accurately,
      and wrote a most perplexing hand. This account I was to keep. It might
      truly be called a bill of mortality; for my members all went from bad to
      worse during the short time they continued in this system. I was a sort of
      bookkeeper for the other world, to take places in the stage, and to see
      that the first come were the first served. My pen was always in my hand,
      for Dr. Sangrado had more practise than any physician of his time in
      Valladolid. He had got into reputation with the public by a certain
      professional slang, humored by a medical face, and some extraordinary
      cures more honored by implicit faith than scrupulous investigation.
    

      He was in no want of patients, nor consequently of property. He did not
      keep the best house in the world; we lived with some little attention to
      economy. The usual bill of fare consisted of peas, beans, boiled apples,
      or cheese. He considered this food as best suited to the human stomach;
      that is to say, as most amenable to the grinders, whence it was to
      encounter the process of digestion. Nevertheless, easy as was their
      passage, he was not for stopping the way with too much of them; and, to be
      sure, he was in the right. But though he cautioned the maid and me against
      repletion in respect of solids, it was made up by free permission to drink
      as much water as we liked. Far from prescribing us any limits in that
      direction, he would tell us sometimes:
    

      “Drink, my children; health consists in the pliability and moisture
      of the parts. Drink water by pailfuls; it is a universal dissolvent; water
      liquefies all the salts. Is the course of the blood a little sluggish?
      This grand principle sets it forward. Too rapid? Its career is checked.”
    

      Our doctor was so orthodox on this head that, though advanced in years, he
      drank nothing himself but water. He defined old age to be a natural
      consumption which dries us up and wastes us away; on this principle he
      deplored the ignorance of those who call wine “old men’s milk.”
      He maintained that wine wears them out and corrodes them; and pleaded with
      all the force of his eloquence against that liquor, fatal in common both
      to the young and old—that friend with a serpent in its bosom—that
      pleasure with a dagger under its girdle.
    

      In spite of these fine arguments, at the end of a week I felt an ailment
      which I was blasphemous enough to saddle on the universal dissolvent and
      the new-fangled diet. I stated my symptoms to my master, in the hope that
      he would relax the rigor of his regimen and qualify my meals with a little
      wine; but his hostility to that liquor was inflexible.
    

      “If you have not philosophy enough,” said he, “for pure
      water, there are innocent infusions to strengthen the stomach against the
      nausea of aqueous quaffings. Sage, for example, has a very pretty flavor;
      and if you wish to heighten it into a debauch, it is only mixing rosemary,
      wild poppy, and other simples with it—but no compounds!”
    

      In vain did he sing the praise of water, and teach me the secret of
      composing delicious messes. I was so abstemious that, remarking my
      moderation, he said:
    

      “In good sooth, Gil Blas, I marvel not that you are no better than
      you are; you do not drink enough, my friend. Water taken in a small
      quantity serves only to separate the particles of bile and set them in
      action; but our practise is to drown them in a copious drench. Fear not,
      my good lad, lest a superabundance of liquid should either weaken or chill
      your stomach; far from thy better judgment be that silly fear of
      unadulterated drink. I will insure you against all consequences; and if my
      authority will not serve your turn, read Celsus. That oracle of the
      ancients makes an admirable panegyric on water; in short, he says in plain
      terms that those who plead an inconstant stomach in favor of wine, publish
      a libel on their own viscera, and make their constitution a pretense for
      their sensuality.”
    

      As it would have been ungenteel in me to run riot on my entrance into the
      medical career, I pretended thorough conviction; indeed, I really thought
      there was something in it. I therefore went on drinking water on the
      authority of Celsus; or, to speak in scientific terms, I began to drown
      the bile in copious drenches of that unadulterated liquor; and though I
      felt my self more out of order from day to day, prejudice won the cause
      against experience. It is evident therefore that I was in the right road
      to the practise of physic.
    

      Yet I could not always be insensible to the qualms which increased in my
      frame, to that degree as to determine me on quitting Dr. Sangrado. But he
      invested me with a new office which changed my tone.
    

      “Hark you, my child,” said he to me one day; “I am not
      one of those hard and ungrateful masters who leave their household to grow
      gray in service without a suitable reward. I am well pleased with you, I
      have a regard for you; and without waiting till you have served your time,
      I will make your fortune. Without more ado, I will initiate you in the
      healing art, of which I have for so many years been at the head. Other
      physicians make the science to consist of various unintelligible branches;
      but I will shorten the road for you, and dispense with the drudgery of
      studying natural philosophy, pharmacy, botany, and anatomy. Remember, my
      friend, that bleeding and drinking warm water are the two grand principles—the
      true secret of curing all the distempers incident to humanity.
    

      “Yes, this marvelous secret which I reveal to you, and which nature,
      beyond the reach of my colleagues, has not been able to conceal from me,
      is comprehended in these two articles, namely, bleeding and drenching.
      Here you have the sum total of my philosophy; you are thoroughly bottomed
      in medicine, and may raise yourself to the summit of fame on the shoulders
      of my long experience. You may enter into partnership at once, by keeping
      the books in the morning and going out to visit patients in the afternoon.
      While I dose the nobility and clergy, you shall labor in your vocation
      among the lower orders; and when you have felt your ground a little, I
      will get you admitted into our body. You are a philosopher, Gil Blas,
      though you have never graduated; the common herd of them, though they have
      graduated in due form and order, are likely to run out the length of their
      tether without knowing their right hand from their left.”
    

      I thanked the doctor for having so speedily enabled me to serve as his
      deputy; and by way of acknowledging his goodness, promised to follow his
      system to the end of my career, with a magnanimous indifference about the
      aphorisms of Hippocrates. But that engagement was not to be taken to the
      letter. This tender attachment to water went against the grain, and I had
      a scheme for drinking wine every day snugly among the patients. I left off
      wearing my own suit a second time to take up one of my master’s and
      look like an experienced practitioner. After which I brought my medical
      theories into play, leaving those it might concern to look to the event.
    

      I began on an alguazil (constable) in a pleurisy; he was condemned to be
      bled with the utmost rigor of the law, at the same time that the system
      was to be replenished copiously with water. Next I made a lodgment in the
      veins of a gouty pastry-cook, who roared like a lion by reason of gouty
      spasms. I stood on no more ceremony with his blood than with that of the
      alguazil, and laid no restriction on his taste for simple liquids. My
      prescriptions brought me in twelve reales (shillings)—an incident so
      auspicious in my professional career that I only wished for the plagues of
      Egypt on all the hale citizens of Valladolid.
    

      I was no sooner at home than Dr. Sangrado came in. I talked to him about
      the patients I had seen, and paid into his hands eight reales of the
      twelve I had received for my prescriptions.
    

      “Eight reales!” said he, as he counted them. “Mighty
      little for two visits! But we must take things as we find them.” In
      the spirit of taking things as he found them, he laid violent hands on six
      of the coins, giving me the other two. “Here, Gil Blas,”
      continued he, “see what a foundation to build upon. I make over to
      you the fourth of all you may bring me. You will soon feather your nest,
      my friend; for, by the blessing of Providence, there will be a great deal
      of ill-health this year.”
    

      I had reason to be content with my dividend; since, having determined to
      keep back the third part of what I recovered in my rounds, and afterward
      touching another fourth of the remainder, then half of the whole, if
      arithmetic is anything more than a deception, would become my perquisite.
      This inspired me with new zeal for my profession.
    

      The next day, as soon as I had dined, I resumed my medical paraphernalia
      and took the field once more. I visited several patients on the list, and
      treated their several complaints in one invariable routine. Hitherto
      things had gone well, and no one, thank Heaven, had risen up in rebellion
      against my prescriptions. But let a physician’s cures be as
      extraordinary as they will, some quack or other is always ready to rip up
      his reputation.
    

      I was called in to a grocer’s son in a dropsy. Whom should I find
      there before me but a little black-looking physician, by name Dr.
      Cuchillo, introduced by a relation of the family. I bowed round most
      profoundly, but dipped lowest to the personage whom I took to have been
      invited to a consultation with me.
    

      He returned my compliment with a distant air; then, having stared me in
      the face for a few seconds, “Sir,” said he, “I beg
      pardon for being inquisitive; I thought I was acquainted with all my
      brethren in Valladolid, but I confess your physiognomy is altogether new.
      You must have been settled but a short time in town.”
    

      I avowed myself a young practitioner, acting as yet under direction of Dr.
      Sangrado.
    

      “I wish you joy,” replied he politely; “you are studying
      under a great man. You must doubtless have seen a vast deal of sound
      practise, young as you appear to be.”
    

      He spoke this with so easy an assurance that I was at a loss whether he
      meant it seriously, or was laughing at me. While I was conning over my
      reply, the grocer, seizing on the opportunity, said:
    

      “Gentlemen, I am persuaded of your both being perfectly competent in
      your art; have the goodness without ado to take the case in hand, and
      devise some effectual means for the restoration of my son’s health.”
    

      Thereupon the little pulse-counter set himself about reviewing the patient’s
      situation; and after having dilated to me on all the symptoms, asked me
      what I thought the fittest method of treatment.
    

      “I am of opinion,” replied I, “that he should be bled
      once a day, and drink as much warm water as he can swallow.”
    

      At these words, our diminutive doctor said to me, with a malicious simper,
      “And so you think such a course will save the patient?”
    

      “Not a doubt of it,” exclaimed I in a confident tone; “it
      must produce that effect, because it is a certain method of cure for all
      distempers. Ask SeÃ±or Sangrado.”
    

      “At that rate,” retorted he, “Celsus is altogether in
      the wrong; for he contends that the readiest way to cure a dropsical
      subject is to let him almost die of hunger and thirst.”
    

      “Oh, as for Celsus,” interrupted I, “he is no oracle of
      mine; he is as fallible as the meanest of us; I often have occasion to
      bless myself for going contrary to his dogmas.”
    

      “I discover by your language,” said Cuchillo, “the safe
      and sure method of practise Dr. Sangrado instils into his pupils! Bleeding
      and drenching are the extent of his resources. No wonder so many worthy
      people are cut off under his direction!”
    

      “No defamation!” interrupted I, with some acrimony. “A
      member of the faculty had better not begin throwing stones. Come, come, my
      learned doctor, patients can get to the other world without bleeding and
      warm water; and I question whether the most deadly of us has ever signed
      more passports than yourself. If you have any crow to pluck with SeÃ±or
      Sangrado, publish an attack on him; he will answer you, and we shall soon
      see who will have the best of the battle.”
    

      “By all the saints in the calendar,” swore he in a transport
      of passion, “you little know whom you are talking to! I have a
      tongue and a fist, my friend; and am not afraid of Sangrado, who with all
      his arrogance and affectation is but a ninny.”
    

      The size of the little death-dealer made me hold his anger cheap. I gave
      him a sharp retort; he sent back as good as I brought, till at last we
      came to fisticuffs. We had pulled a few handfuls of hair from each other’s
      head before the grocer and his kinsman could part us. When they had
      brought this about, they feed me for my attendance and retained my
      antagonist, whom they thought the more skilful of the two.
    

      Another adventure succeeded close on the heels of this. I went to see a
      huge singer in a fever. As soon as he heard me talk of warm water, he
      showed himself so adverse to this specific as to fall into a fit of
      swearing. He abused me in all possible shapes, and threatened to throw me
      out of the window. I was in a greater hurry to get out of his house than
      to get in.
    

      I did not choose to see any more patients that day, and repaired to the
      inn where I had agreed to meet Fabricio. He was there first. As we found
      ourselves in a tippling humor, we drank hard, and returned to our
      employers in a pretty pickle; that is to say, so-so in the upper story.
      SeÃ±or Sangrado was not aware of my being drunk, because he took the lively
      gestures which accompanied the relation of my quarrel with the little
      doctor for an effect of the agitation not yet subsided after the battle.
      Besides, he came in for his share in my report; and, feeling himself
      nettled by the insults of Cuchillo—
    

      “You have done well, Gil Blas,” said he, “to defend the
      character of our practise against this little abortion of the faculty. So
      he takes upon him to set his face against watery drenches in dropsical
      cases? An ignorant fellow! I maintain, I do, in my own person, that the
      use of them may be reconciled to the best theories. Yes, water is a cure
      for all sorts of dropsies, just as it is good for rheumatisms and the
      green sickness. It is excellent, too, in those fevers where the effect is
      at once to parch and to chill; and even miraculous in those disorders
      ascribed to cold, thin, phlegmatic, and pituitous humors. This opinion may
      appear strange to young practitioners like Cuchillo, but it is right
      orthodox in the best and soundest systems; so that if persons of that
      description were capable of taking a philosophical view, instead of crying
      me down, they would become my most zealous advocates.”
    

      In his rage, he never suspected me of drinking; for to exasperate him
      still more against the little doctor, I had thrown into my recital some
      circumstances of my own addition. Yet, engrossed as he was by what I had
      told him, he could not help taking notice that I drank more water than
      usual that evening.
    

      In fact, the wine had made me very thirsty. Any one but Sangrado would
      have distrusted my being so very dry as to swallow down glass after glass;
      but, as for him, he took it for granted in the simplicity of his heart
      that I had begun to acquire a relish for aqueous potations.
    

      “Apparently, Gil Blas,” said he, with a gracious smile,
      “you have no longer such a dislike to water. As Heaven is my judge,
      you quaff it off like nectar! It is no wonder, my friend; I was certain
      you would before long take a liking to that liquor.”
    

      “Sir,” replied I, “there is a tide in the affairs of
      men; with my present lights I would give all the wine in Valladolid for a
      pint of water.”
    

      This answer delighted the doctor, who would not lose so fine an
      opportunity of expatiating on the excellence of water. He undertook to
      ring the changes once more in its praise; not like a hireling pleader, but
      as an enthusiast in a most worthy cause.
    

      “A thousand times,” exclaimed he, “a thousand and a
      thousand times of greater value, as being more innocent than all our
      modern taverns, were those baths of ages past, whither the people went,
      not shamefully to squander their fortunes and expose their lives by
      swilling themselves with wine, but assembling there for the decent and
      economical amusement of drinking warm water. It is difficult to admire
      enough the patriotic forecast of those ancient politicians who established
      places of public resort where water was dealt out gratis to all comers,
      and who confined wine to the shops of the apothecaries, that its use might
      be prohibited save under the direction of physicians. What a stroke of
      wisdom! It is doubtless to preserve the seeds of that antique frugality,
      emblematic of the golden age, that persons are found to this day, like you
      and me, who drink nothing but water, and are persuaded they possess a
      prevention or a cure for every ailment, provided our warm water has never
      boiled; for I have observed that water when it is boiled is heavier, and
      sits less easily on the stomach.”
    

      While he was holding forth thus eloquently, I was in danger more than once
      of splitting my sides with laughing. But I contrived to keep my
      countenance; nay, more, to chime in with the doctor’s theory. I
      found fault with the use of wine, and pitied mankind for having contracted
      an untoward relish for so pernicious a beverage. Then, finding my thirst
      not sufficiently allayed, I filled a large goblet with water, and, after
      having swilled it like a horse—
    

      “Come, sir,” said I to my master, “let us drink
      plentifully of this beneficial liquor. Let us make those early
      establishments of dilution you so much regret live again in your house.”
    

      He clapped his hands in ecstasy at these words, and preached to me for a
      whole hour about suffering no liquid but water to pass my lips. To confirm
      the habit, I promised to drink a large quantity every evening; and to keep
      my word with less violence to my private inclinations, I went to bed with
      a determined purpose of going to the tavern every day.
