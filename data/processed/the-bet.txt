THE BET


BY ANTON P. CHEKHOV


I

It was a dark autumn night. The old banker was pacing from corner to
corner of his study, recalling to his mind the party he gave in the autumn
fifteen years before. There were many clever people at the party and much
interesting conversation. They talked among other things of capital
punishment. The guests, among them not a few scholars and journalists, for
the most part disapproved of capital punishment. They found it obsolete as
a means of punishment, unfitted to a Christian State and immoral. Some of
them thought that capital punishment should be replaced universally by
life-imprisonment.


“I don’t agree with you,” said the host. “I myself
have experienced neither capital punishment nor life-imprisonment, but if
one may judge a priori, then in my opinion capital punishment is
more moral and more humane than imprisonment. Execution kills instantly,
life-imprisonment kills by degrees. Who is the more humane executioner,
one who kills you in a few seconds or one who draws the life out of you
incessantly, for years?”


“They’re both equally immoral,” remarked one of the
guests, “because their purpose is the same, to take away life. The
State is not God. It has no right to take away that which it cannot give
back, if it should so desire.”


Among the company was a lawyer, a young man of about twenty-five. On being
asked his opinion, he said:


“Capital punishment and life-imprisonment are equally immoral; but
if I were offered the choice between them, I would certainly choose the
second. It’s better to live somehow than not to live at all.”


There ensued a lively discussion. The banker who was then younger and more
nervous suddenly lost his temper, banged his fist on the table, and
turning to the young lawyer, cried out:


“It’s a lie. I bet you two millions you wouldn’t stick
in a cell even for five years.”


“If you mean it seriously,” replied the lawyer, “then I
bet I’ll stay not five but fifteen.”


“Fifteen! Done!” cried the banker. “Gentlemen, I stake
two millions.”


“Agreed. You stake two millions, I my freedom,” said the
lawyer.


So this wild, ridiculous bet came to pass. The banker, who at that time
had too many millions to count, spoiled and capricious, was beside himself
with rapture. During supper he said to the lawyer jokingly:


“Come to your senses, young roan, before it’s too late. Two
millions are nothing to me, but you stand to lose three or four of the
best years of your life. I say three or four, because you’ll never
stick it out any longer. Don’t forget either, you unhappy man, that
voluntary is much heavier than enforced imprisonment. The idea that you
have the right to free yourself at any moment will poison the whole of
your life in the cell. I pity you.”


And now the banker, pacing from corner to corner, recalled all this and
asked himself:


“Why did I make this bet? What’s the good? The lawyer loses
fifteen years of his life and I throw away two millions. Will it convince
people that capital punishment is worse or better than imprisonment for
life? No, no! all stuff and rubbish. On my part, it was the caprice of a
well-fed man; on the lawyer’s pure greed of gold.”


He recollected further what happened after the evening party. It was
decided that the lawyer must undergo his imprisonment under the strictest
observation, in a garden wing of the banker’s house. It was agreed
that during the period he would be deprived of the right to cross the
threshold, to see living people, to hear human voices, and to receive
letters and newspapers. He was permitted to have a musical instrument, to
read books, to write letters, to drink wine and smoke tobacco. By the
agreement he could communicate, but only in silence, with the outside
world through a little window specially constructed for this purpose.
Everything necessary, books, music, wine, he could receive in any quantity
by sending a note through the window. The agreement provided for all the
minutest details, which made the confinement strictly solitary, and it
obliged the lawyer to remain exactly fifteen years from twelve o’clock
of November 14th, 1870, to twelve o’clock of November 14th, 1885.
The least attempt on his part to violate the conditions, to escape if only
for two minutes before the time freed the banker from the obligation to
pay him the two millions.


During the first year of imprisonment, the lawyer, as far as it was
possible to judge from his short notes, suffered terribly from loneliness
and boredom. From his wing day and night came the sound of the piano. He
rejected wine and tobacco. “Wine,” he wrote, “excites
desires, and desires are the chief foes of a prisoner; besides, nothing is
more boring than to drink good wine alone,” and tobacco spoils the
air in his room. During the first year the lawyer was sent books of a
light character; novels with a complicated love interest, stories of crime
and fantasy, comedies, and so on.


In the second year the piano was heard no longer and the lawyer asked only
for classics. In the fifth year, music was heard again, and the prisoner
asked for wine. Those who watched him said that during the whole of that
year he was only eating, drinking, and lying on his bed. He yawned often
and talked angrily to himself. Books he did not read. Sometimes at nights
he would sit down to write. He would write for a long time and tear it all
up in the morning. More than once he was heard to weep.


In the second half of the sixth year, the prisoner began zealously to
study languages, philosophy, and history. He fell on these subjects so
hungrily that the banker hardly had time to get books enough for him. In
the space of four years about six hundred volumes were bought at his
request. It was while that passion lasted that the banker received the
following letter from the prisoner: “My dear gaoler, I am writing
these lines in six languages. Show them to experts. Let them read them. If
they do not find one single mistake, I beg you to give orders to have a
gun fired off in the garden. By the noise I shall know that my efforts
have not been in vain. The geniuses of all ages and countries speak in
different languages; but in them all burns the same flame. Oh, if you knew
my heavenly happiness now that I can understand them!” The prisoner’s
desire was fulfilled. Two shots were fired in the garden by the banker’s
order.


Later on, after the tenth year, the lawyer sat immovable before his table
and read only the New Testament. The banker found it strange that a man
who in four years had mastered six hundred erudite volumes, should have
spent nearly a year in reading one book, easy to understand and by no
means thick. The New Testament was then replaced by the history of
religions and theology.


During the last two years of his confinement the prisoner read an
extraordinary amount, quite haphazard. Now he would apply himself to the
natural sciences, then he would read Byron or Shakespeare. Notes used to
come from him in which he asked to be sent at the same time a book on
chemistry, a text-book of medicine, a novel, and some treatise on
philosophy or theology. He read as though he were swimming in the sea
among broken pieces of wreckage, and in his desire to save his life was
eagerly grasping one piece after another.


II

The banker recalled all this, and thought:


“To-morrow at twelve o’clock he receives his freedom. Under
the agreement, I shall have to pay him two millions. If I pay, it’s
all over with me. I am ruined for ever ...”


Fifteen years before he had too many millions to count, but now he was
afraid to ask himself which he had more of, money or debts. Gambling on
the Stock-Exchange, risky speculation, and the recklessness of which he
could not rid himself even in old age, had gradually brought his business
to decay; and the fearless, self-confident, proud man of business had
become an ordinary banker, trembling at every rise and fall in the market.


“That cursed bet,” murmured the old man clutching his head in
despair... “Why didn’t the man die? He’s only forty
years old. He will take away my last farthing, marry, enjoy life, gamble
on the Exchange, and I will look on like an envious beggar and hear the
same words from him every day: ‘I’m obliged to you for the
happiness of my life. Let me help you.’ No, it’s too much! The
only escape from bankruptcy and disgrace—is that the man should die.”


The clock had just struck three. The banker was listening. In the house
every one was asleep, and one could hear only the frozen trees whining
outside the windows. Trying to make no sound, he took out of his safe the
key of the door which had not been opened for fifteen years, put on his
overcoat, and went out of the house. The garden was dark and cold. It was
raining. A damp, penetrating wind howled in the garden and gave the trees
no rest. Though he strained his eyes, the banker could see neither the
ground, nor the white statues, nor the garden wing, nor the trees.
Approaching the garden wing, he called the watchman twice. There was no
answer. Evidently the watchman had taken shelter from the bad weather and
was now asleep somewhere in the kitchen or the greenhouse.


“If I have the courage to fulfil my intention,” thought the
old man, “the suspicion will fall on the watchman first of all.”


In the darkness he groped for the steps and the door and entered the hall
of the garden-wing, then poked his way into a narrow passage and struck a
match. Not a soul was there. Some one’s bed, with no bedclothes on
it, stood there, and an iron stove loomed dark in the corner. The seals on
the door that led into the prisoner’s room were unbroken.


When the match went out, the old man, trembling from agitation, peeped
into the little window.


In the prisoner’s room a candle was burning dimly. The prisoner
himself sat by the table. Only his back, the hair on his head and his
hands were visible. Open books were strewn about on the table, the two
chairs, and on the carpet near the table.


Five minutes passed and the prisoner never once stirred. Fifteen years’
confinement had taught him to sit motionless. The banker tapped on the
window with his finger, but the prisoner made no movement in reply. Then
the banker cautiously tore the seals from the door and put the key into
the lock. The rusty lock gave a hoarse groan and the door creaked. The
banker expected instantly to hear a cry of surprise and the sound of
steps. Three minutes passed and it was as quiet inside as it had been
before. He made up his mind to enter.


Before the table sat a man, unlike an ordinary human being. It was a
skeleton, with tight-drawn skin, with long curly hair like a woman’s,
and a shaggy beard. The colour of his face was yellow, of an earthy shade;
the cheeks were sunken, the back long and narrow, and the hand upon which
he leaned his hairy head was so lean and skinny that it was painful to
look upon. His hair was already silvering with grey, and no one who
glanced at the senile emaciation of the face would have believed that he
was only forty years old. On the table, before his bended head, lay a
sheet of paper on which something was written in a tiny hand.


“Poor devil,” thought the banker, “he’s asleep and
probably seeing millions in his dreams. I have only to take and throw this
half-dead thing on the bed, smother him a moment with the pillow, and the
most careful examination will find no trace of unnatural death. But,
first, let us read what he has written here.”


The banker took the sheet from the table and read:


“To-morrow at twelve o’clock midnight, I shall obtain my
freedom and the right to mix with people. But before I leave this room and
see the sun I think it necessary to say a few words to you. On my own
clear conscience and before God who sees me I declare to you that I
despise freedom, life, health, and all that your books call the blessings
of the world.


“For fifteen years I have diligently studied earthly life. True, I
saw neither the earth nor the people, but in your books I drank fragrant
wine, sang songs, hunted deer and wild boar in the forests, loved women...
And beautiful women, like clouds ethereal, created by the magic of your
poets’ genius, visited me by night and whispered to me wonderful
tales, which made my head drunken. In your books I climbed the summits of
Elbruz and Mont Blanc and saw from there how the sun rose in the morning,
and in the evening suffused the sky, the ocean and the mountain ridges
with a purple gold. I saw from there how above me lightnings glimmered
cleaving the clouds; I saw green forests, fields, rivers, lakes, cities; I
heard syrens singing, and the playing of the pipes of Pan; I touched the
wings of beautiful devils who came flying to me to speak of God... In your
books I cast myself into bottomless abysses, worked miracles, burned
cities to the ground, preached new religions, conquered whole countries...


“Your books gave me wisdom. All that unwearying human thought
created in the centuries is compressed to a little lump in my skull. I
know that I am cleverer than you all.


“And I despise your books, despise all worldly blessings and wisdom.
Everything is void, frail, visionary and delusive as a mirage. Though you
be proud and wise and beautiful, yet will death wipe you from the face of
the earth like the mice underground; and your posterity, your history, and
the immortality of your men of genius will be as frozen slag, burnt down
together with the terrestrial globe.


“You are mad, and gone the wrong way. You take falsehood for truth
and ugliness for beauty. You would marvel if suddenly apple and orange
trees should bear frogs and lizards instead of fruit, and if roses should
begin to breathe the odour of a sweating horse. So do I marvel at you, who
have bartered heaven for earth. I do not want to understand you.


“That I may show you in deed my contempt for that by which you live,
I waive the two millions of which I once dreamed as of paradise, and which
I now despise. That I may deprive myself of my right to them, I shall come
out from here five minutes before the stipulated term, and thus shall
violate the agreement.”


When he had read, the banker put the sheet on the table, kissed the head
of the strange man, and began to weep. He went out of the wing. Never at
any other time, not even after his terrible losses on the Exchange, had he
felt such contempt for himself as now. Coming home, he lay down on his
bed, but agitation and tears kept him a long time from sleeping...


The next morning the poor watchman came running to him and told him that
they had seen the man who lived in the wing climb through the window into
the garden. He had gone to the gate and disappeared. The banker instantly
went with his servants to the wing and established the escape of his
prisoner. To avoid unnecessary rumours he took the paper with the
renunciation from the table and, on his return, locked it in his safe.
