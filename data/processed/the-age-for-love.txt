THE AGE FOR LOVE By Paul Bourget
    

      When I submitted the plan of my Inquiry Upon the Age for Love to the
      editor-in-chief of the Boulevard, the highest type of French literary
      paper, he seemed astonished that an idea so journalistic—that was
      his word—should have been evolved from the brain of his most recent
      acquisition. I had been with him two weeks and it was my first
      contribution. “Give me some details, my dear Labarthe,” he
      said, in a somewhat less insolent manner than was his wont. After
      listening to me for a few moments he continued: “That is good. You
      will go and interview certain men and women, first upon the age at which
      one loves the most, next upon the age when one is most loved? Is that your
      idea? And now to whom will you go first?”
    

      “I have prepared a list,” I replied, and took from my pocket a
      sheet of paper. I had jotted down the names of a number of celebrities
      whom I proposed to interview on this all-important question, and I began
      to read over my list. It contained two ex-government officials, a general,
      a Dominican father, four actresses, two cafÃ©-concert singers, four actors,
      two financiers, two lawyers, a surgeon and a lot of literary celebrities.
      At some of the names my chief would nod his approval, at others he would
      say curtly, with an affectation of American manners, “Bad; strike it
      off,” until I came to the name I had kept for the last, that of
      Pierre Fauchery, the famous novelist.
    

      “Strike that off,” he said, shrugging his shoulders. “He
      is not on good terms with us.”
    

      “And yet,” I suggested, “is there any one whose opinion
      would be of greater interest to reading men as well as to women? I had
      even thought of beginning with him.”
    

      “The devil you had!” interrupted the editor-in-chief. “It
      is one of Fauchery’s principles not to see any reporters. I have
      sent him ten if I have one, and he has shown them all the door. The
      Boulevard does not relish such treatment, so we have given him some pretty
      hard hits.”
    

      “Nevertheless, I will have an interview with Fauchery for the
      Boulevard,” was my reply. “I am sure of it.”
    

      “If you succeed,” he replied, “I’ll raise your
      salary. That man makes me tired with his scorn of newspaper notoriety. He
      must take his share of it, like the rest. But you will not succeed. What
      makes you think you can?”
    

      “Permit me to tell you my reason later. In forty-eight hours you
      will see whether I have succeeded or not.”
    

      “Go and do not spare the fellow.”
    

      Decidedly. I had made some progress as a journalist, even in my two weeks’
      apprenticeship, if I could permit Pascal to speak in this way of the man I
      most admired among living writers. Since that not far-distant time when,
      tired of being poor, I had made up my mind to cast my lot with the
      multitude in Paris, I had tried to lay aside my old self, as lizards do
      their skins, and I had almost succeeded. In a former time, a former time
      that was but yesterday, I knew—for in a drawer full of poems, dramas
      and half-finished tales I had proof of it—that there had once
      existed a certain Jules Labarthe who had come to Paris with the hope of
      becoming a great man. That person believed in Literature with a capital
      “L;” in the Ideal, another capital; in Glory, a third capital.
      He was now dead and buried. Would he some day, his position assured, begin
      to write once more from pure love of his art? Possibly, but for the moment
      I knew only the energetic, practical Labarthe, who had joined the
      procession with the idea of getting into the front rank, and of obtaining
      as soon as possible an income of thirty thousand francs a year. What would
      it matter to this second individual if that vile Pascal should boast of
      having stolen a march on the most delicate, the most powerful of the heirs
      of Balzac, since I, the new Labarthe, was capable of looking forward to an
      operation which required about as much delicacy as some of the
      performances of my editor-in-chief? I had, as a matter of fact, a sure
      means of obtaining the interview. It was this: When I was young and simple
      I had sent some verses and stories to Pierre Fauchery, the same verses and
      stories the refusal of which by four editors had finally made me decide to
      enter the field of journalism. The great writer was traveling at this
      time, but he had replied to me. I had responded by a letter to which he
      again replied, this time with an invitation to call upon him. I went I did
      not find him. I went again. I did not find him that time. Then a sort of
      timidity prevented my returning to the charge. So I had never met him. He
      knew me only as the young Elia of my two epistles. This is what I counted
      upon to extort from him the favor of an interview which he certainly would
      refuse to a mere newspaper man. My plan was simple; to present myself at
      his house, to be received, to conceal my real occupation, to sketch
      vaguely a subject for a novel in which there should occur a discussion
      upon the Age for Love, to make him talk and then when he should discover
      his conversation in print—here I began to feel some remorse. But I
      stifled it with the terrible phrase, “the struggle for life,”
      and also by the recollection of numerous examples culled from the firm
      with which I now had the honor of being connected.
    

      The morning after I had had this very literary conversation with my
      honorable director, I rang at the door of the small house in the Rue
      Desbordes-Valmore where Pierre Fauchery lived, in a retired corner of
      Passy. Having taken up my pen to tell a plain unvarnished tale I do not
      see how I can conceal the wretched feeling of pleasure which, as I rang
      the bell, warmed my heart at the thought of the good joke I was about to
      play on the owner of this peaceful abode.
    

      Even after making up one’s mind to the sacrifices I had decided
      upon, there is always left a trace of envy for those who have triumphed in
      the melancholy struggle for literary supremacy. It was a real
      disappointment to me when the servant replied, ill-humoredly, that M.
      Fauchery was not in Paris. I asked when he would return. The servant did
      not know. I asked for his address. The servant did not know that. Poor
      lion, who thought he had secured anonymity for his holiday! A half-hour
      later I had discovered that he was staying for the present at the ChÃ¢teau
      de Proby, near Nemours. I had merely had to make inquiries of his
      publisher. Two hours later I bought my ticket at the Gare de Lyon for the
      little town chosen by Balzac as the scene for his delicious story of
      Ursule Mirouet. I took a traveling bag and was prepared to spend the night
      there. In case I failed to see the master that afternoon I had decided to
      make sure of him the next morning. Exactly seven hours after the servant,
      faithful to his trust, had declared that he did not know where his master
      was staying, I was standing in the hall of the chÃ¢teau waiting for my card
      to be sent up. I had taken care to write on it a reminder of our
      conversation of the year before, and this time, after a ten-minute wait in
      the hall, during which I noticed with singular curiosity and malice
      two very elegant and very pretty young women going out for a walk, I was
      admitted to his presence. “Aha,” I said to myself, “this
      then is the secret of his exile; the interview promises well!”
    

      The novelist received me in a cosy little room, with a window opening onto
      the park, already beginning to turn yellow with the advancing autumn. A
      wood fire burned in the fireplace and lighted up the walls which were hung
      with flowered cretonne and on which could be distinguished several colored
      English prints representing cross-country rides and the jumping of hedges.
      Here was the worldly environment with which Fauchery is so often
      reproached. But the books and papers that littered the table bore witness
      that the present occupant of this charming retreat remained a substantial
      man of letters. His habit of constant work was still further attested by
      his face, which I admit, gave me all at once a feeling of remorse for the
      trick I was about to play him. If I had found him the snobbish pretender
      whom the weekly newspapers were in the habit of ridiculing, it would have
      been a delight to outwit his diplomacy. But no! I saw, as he put down his
      pen to receive me, a man about fifty-seven years old, with a face that
      bore the marks of reflection, eyes tired from sleeplessness, a brow heavy
      with thought, who said as he pointed to an easy chair, “You will
      excuse me, my dear confrÃ¨re, for keeping you waiting.” I, his dear
      confrÃ¨re! Ah! if he had known! “You see,” and he pointed to
      the page still wet with ink, “that man cannot be free from the
      slavery of furnishing copy. One has less facility at my age than at yours.
      Now, let us speak of yourself. How do you happen to be at Nemours? What
      have you been doing since the story and the verses you were kind enough to
      send me?”
    

      It is vain to try to sacrifice once for all one’s youthful ideals.
      When a man has loved literature as I loved it at twenty, he cannot be
      satisfied at twenty-six to give up his early passion, even at the bidding
      of implacable necessity. So Pierre Fauchery remembered my poor verses! He
      had actually read my story! His allusion proved it. Could I tell him at
      such a moment that since the creation of those first works I had despaired
      of myself, and that I had changed my gun to the other shoulder? The image
      of the Boulevard office rose suddenly before me. I heard the voice of the
      editor-in-chief saying, “Interview Fauchery? You will never
      accomplish that;” so, faithful to my self-imposed rÃ´le, I replied,
      “I have retired to Nemours to work upon a novel called The Age for
      Love, and it is on this subject that I wished to consult you, my dear
      master.”
    

      It seemed to me—it may possibly have been an illusion—that at
      the announcement of the so-called title of my so-called novel, a smile and
      a shadow flitted over Fauchery’s eyes and mouth. A vision of the two
      young women I had met in the hall came back to me. Was the author of so
      many great masterpieces of analysis about to live a new book before
      writing it? I had no time to answer this question, for, with a glance at
      an onyx vase containing some cigarettes of Turkish tobacco, he offered me
      one, lighted one himself and began first to question, then to reply to me.
      I listened while he thought aloud and had almost forgotten my
      Machiavellian combination, so keen was my relish of the joyous intimacy of
      this communion with a mind I had passionately loved in his works. He was
      the first of the great writers of our day whom I had thus approached on
      something like terms of intimacy. As we talked I observed the strange
      similarity between his spoken and his written words. I admired the
      charming simplicity with which he abandoned himself to the pleasures of
      imagination, his superabundant intelligence, the liveliness of his
      impressions and his total absence of arrogance and of pose.
    

      “There is no such thing as an age for love,” he said in
      substance, “because the man capable of loving—in the complex
      and modern sense of love as a sort of ideal exaltation—never ceases
      to love. I will go further; he never ceases to love the same person. You
      know the experiment that a contemporary physiologist tried with a series
      of portraits to determine in what the indefinable resemblances called
      family likeness consisted? He took photographs of twenty persons of the
      same blood, then he photographed these photographs on the same plate, one
      over the other. In this way he discovered the common features which
      determined the type. Well, I am convinced that if we could try a similar
      experiment and photograph one upon another the pictures of the different
      women whom the same man has loved or thought he had loved in the course of
      his life we should discover that all these women resembled one another.
      The most inconsistent have cherished one and the same being through five
      or six or even twenty different embodiments. The main point is to find out
      at what age they have met the woman who approaches nearest to the one
      whose image they have constantly borne within themselves. For them that
      would be the age for love.
    

      “The age for being loved?” he continued. “The deepest of
      all the passions I have ever known a man to inspire was in the case of one
      of my masters, a poet, and he was sixty years old at the time. It is true
      that he still held himself as erect as a young man, he came and went with
      a step as light as yours, he conversed like Rivarol, he composed verses as
      beautiful as De Vigny’s. He was besides very poor, very lonely and
      very unhappy, having lost one after another, his wife and his children.
      You remember the words of Shakespeare’s Moor: ‘She loved me
      for the dangers I had passed, and I loved her that she did pity them.’
    

      “So it was that this great artist inspired in a beautiful, noble and
      wealthy young Russian woman, a devotion so passionate that because of him
      she never married. She found a way to take care of him, day and night, in
      spite of his family, during his last illness, and at the present time,
      having bought from his heirs all of the poet’s personal belongings,
      she keeps the apartment where he lived just as it was at the time of his
      death. That was years ago. In her case she found in a man three times her
      own age the person who corresponded to a certain ideal which she carried
      in her heart. Look at Goethe, at Lamartine and at many others! To depict
      feelings on this high plane, you must give up the process of minute and
      insignificant observation which is the bane of the artists of to-day. In
      order that a sixty-year-old lover should appear neither ridiculous nor
      odious you must apply to him what the elder Corneille so proudly said of
      himself in his lines to the marquise:
    

  “‘Cependant, j’ai quelques charmes
  Qui sont assez eclatants
  Pour n’avoir pas trop d’alarmes
  De ces ravages du temps.’


      “Have the courage to analyze great emotions to create characters who
      shall be lofty and true. The whole art of the analytical novel lies there.”
    

      As he spoke the master had such a light of intellectual certainty in his
      eyes that to me he seemed the embodiment of one of those great characters
      he had been urging me to describe. It made me feel that the theory of this
      man, himself almost a sexagenarian, that at any age one may inspire love,
      was not unreasonable! The contrast between the world of ideas in which he
      moved and the atmosphere of the literary shop in which for the last few
      months I had been stifling was too strong. The dreams of my youth were
      realized in this man whose gifts remained unimpaired after the production
      of thirty volumes and whose face, growing old, was a living illustration
      of the beautiful saying: “Since we must wear out, let us wear out
      nobly.” His slender figure bespoke the austerity of long hours of
      work; his firm mouth showed his decision of character; his brow, with its
      deep furrows, had the paleness of the paper over which he so often bent;
      and yet, the refinement of his hands, so well cared for, the sober
      elegance of his dress and an aristocratic air that was natural to him
      showed that the finer professional virtues had been cultivated in the
      midst of a life of frivolous temptations. These temptations had been no
      more of a disturbance to his ethical and spiritual nature than the
      academic honors, the financial successes, the numerous editions that had
      been his. Withal he was an awfully good fellow, for, after having talked
      at great length with me, he ended by saying, “Since you are staying
      in Nemours I hope to see you often, and to-day I cannot let you go without
      presenting you to my hostess.”
    

      What could I say? This was the way in which a mere reporter on the
      Boulevard found himself installed at a five-o’clock tea-table in the
      salon of a chÃ¢teau, where surely no newspaper man had ever before set foot
      and was presented as a young poet and novelist of the future to the old
      Marquise de Proby, whose guest the master was. This amiable white-haired
      dowager questioned me upon my alleged work and I replied equivocally, with
      blushes, which the good lady must have attributed to bashful timidity.
      Then, as though some evil genius had conspired to multiply the witnesses
      of my bad conduct, the two young women whom I had seen going out, returned
      in the midst of my unlooked-for visit. Ah, my interview with this student
      of femininity upon the Age for Love was about to have a living commentary!
      How it would illumine his words to hear him conversing with these new
      arrivals! One was a young girl of possibly twenty—a Russian if I
      rightly understood the name. She was rather tall, with a long face lighted
      up by two very gentle black eyes, singular in their fire and intensity.
      She bore a striking resemblance to the portrait attributed to Froncia in
      the Salon CarrÃ© of the Louvre which goes by the name of the “Man in
      Black,” because the color of his clothes and his mantle. About her
      mouth and nostrils was that same subdued nervousness, that same restrained
      feverishness which gives to the portrait its striking qualities. I had not
      been there a quarter of an hour before I had guessed from the way she
      watched and listened to Fauchery what a passionate interest the old master
      inspired in her. When he spoke she paid rapt attention. When she spoke to
      him, I felt her voice shiver, if I may use the word, and he, he glorious
      writer, surfeited with triumphs, exhausted by his labors, seemed, as soon
      as he felt the radiance of her glance of ingenuous idolatry, to recover
      that vivacity, that elasticity of impression, which is the sovereign grace
      of youthful lovers.
    

      “I understand now why he cited Goethe and the young girl of
      Marienbad,” said I to myself with a laugh, as my hired carriage sped
      on toward Nemours. “He was thinking of himself. He is in love with
      that child, and she is in love with him. We shall hear of his marrying
      her. There’s a wedding that will call forth copy, and when Pascal
      hears that I witnessed the courtship—but just now I must think of my
      interview. Won’t Fauchery be surprised to read it day after
      to-morrow in his paper? But does he read the papers? It may not be right
      but what harm will it do him? Besides, it’s a part of the struggle
      for life.” It was by such reasoning, I remember, the reasoning of a
      man determined to arrive that I tried to lull to sleep the inward voice
      that cried, “You have no right to put on paper, to give to the
      public what this noble writer said to you, supposing that he was receiving
      a poet, not a reporter.” But I heard also the voice of my chief
      saying, “You will never succeed.” And this second voice, I am
      ashamed to confess, triumphed over the other with all the more ease
      because I was obliged to do something to kill time. I reached Nemours too
      late for the train which would have brought me back to Paris about dinner
      time. At the old inn they gave me a room which was clean and quiet, a good
      place to write, so I spent the evening until bedtime composing the first
      of the articles which were to form my inquiry. I scribbled away under the
      vivid impressions of the afternoon, my powers as well as my nerves spurred
      by a touch of remorse. Yes, I scribbled four pages which would have been
      no disgrace to the Journal des Goncourts, that exquisite manual of the
      perfect reporter. It was all there, my journey, my arrival at the chateau,
      a sketch of the quaint eighteenth century building, with its fringe of
      trees and its well-kept walks, the master’s room, the master himself
      and his conversation; the tea at the end and the smile of the old novelist
      in the midst of a circle of admirers, old and young. It lacked only a few
      closing lines. “I will add these in the morning,” I thought,
      and went to bed with a feeling of duty performed, such is the nature of a
      writer. Under the form of an interview I had done, and I knew it, the best
      work of my life.
    

      What happens while we sleep? Is there, unknown to us, a secret and
      irresistible ferment of ideas while our senses are closed to the
      impressions of the outside world? Certain it is that on awakening I am apt
      to find myself in a state of mind very different from that in which I went
      to sleep. I had not been awake ten minutes before the image of Pierre
      Fauchery came up before me, and at the same time the thought that I had
      taken a base advantage of the kindness of his reception of me became quite
      unbearable. I felt a passionate longing to see him again, to ask his
      pardon for my deception. I wished to tell him who I was, with what purpose
      I had gone to him and that I regretted it. But there was no need of a
      confession. It would be enough to destroy the pages I had written the
      night before. With this idea I arose. Before tearing them up, I reread
      them. And then—any writer will understand me—and then they
      seemed to me so brilliant that I did not tear them up. Fauchery is so
      intelligent, so generous, was the thought that crossed my mind. What is
      there in this interview, after all, to offend him? Nothing, absolutely
      nothing. Even if I should go to him again this very morning, tell him my
      story and that upon the success of my little inquiry my whole future as a
      journalist might depend? When he found that I had had five years of
      poverty and hard work without accomplishing anything, and that I had had
      to go onto a paper in order to earn the very bread I ate, he would pardon
      me, he would pity me and he would say, “Publish your interview.”
      Yes, but what if he should forbid my publishing it? But no, he would not
      do that.
    

      I passed the morning in considering my latest plan. A certain shyness made
      it very painful to me. But it might at the same time conciliate my
      delicate scruples, my “amour-propre” as an ambitious
      chronicler, and the interests of my pocket-book. I knew that Pascal had
      the name of being very generous with an interview article if it pleased
      him. And besides, had he not promised me a reward if I succeeded with
      Fauchery? In short, I had decided to try my experiment, when, after a
      hasty breakfast, I saw, on stepping into the carriage I had had the night
      before, a victoria with coat-of-arms drive rapidly past and was stunned at
      recognizing Fauchery himself, apparently lost in a gloomy revery that was
      in singular contrast to his high spirits of the night before. A small
      trunk on the coachman’s seat was a sufficient indication that he was
      going to the station. The train for Paris left in twelve minutes, time
      enough for me to pack my things pell-mell into my valise and hurriedly to
      pay my bill. The same carriage which was to have taken me to the ChÃ¢teau
      de Proby carried me to the station at full speed, and when the train left
      I was seated in an empty compartment opposite the famous writer, who was
      saying to me, “You, too, deserting Nemours? Like me, you work best
      in Paris.”
    

      The conversation begun in this way, might easily have led to the
      confession I had resolved to make. But in the presence of my unexpected
      companion I was seized with an unconquerable shyness, moreover he inspired
      me with a curiosity which was quite equal to my shyness. Any number of
      circumstances, from a telegram from a sick relative to the most
      commonplace matter of business, might have explained his sudden departure
      from the chÃ¢teau where I had left him so comfortably installed the night
      before. But that the expression of his face should have changed as it had,
      that in eighteen hours he should have become the careworn, discouraged
      being he now seemed, when I had left him so pleased with life, so happy,
      so assiduous in his attentions to that pretty girl. Mademoiselle de
      Russaie, who loved him and whom he seemed to love, was a mystery which
      took complete possession of me, this time without any underlying
      professional motive. He was to give me the key before we reached Paris. At
      any rate I shall always believe that part of his conversation was in an
      indirect way a confidence. He was still unstrung by the unexpected
      incident which had caused both his hasty departure and the sudden
      metamorphosis in what he himself, if he had been writing, would have
      called his “intimate heaven.” The story he told me was “per
      sfogarsi,” as Bayle loved to say; his idea was that I would not
      discover the real hero. I shall always believe that it was his own story
      under another name, and I love to believe it because it was so exactly his
      way of looking at things. It was apropos of the supposed subject of my
      novel—oh, irony!—apropos of the real subject of my interview
      that he began.
    

      “I have been thinking about our conversation and about your book,
      and I am afraid that I expressed myself badly yesterday. When I said that
      one may love and be loved at any age I ought to have added that sometimes
      this love comes too late. It comes when one no longer has the right to
      prove to the loved one how much she is loved, except by love’s
      sacrifice. I should like to share with you a human document, as they say
      to-day, which is in itself a drama with a dÃ©nouement. But I must ask you
      not to use it, for the secret is not my own.” With the assurance of
      my discretion he went on: “I had a friend, a companion of my own
      age, who, when he was twenty, had loved a young girl. He was poor, she was
      rich. Her family separated them. The girl married some one else and almost
      immediately afterward she died. My friend lived. Some day you will know
      for yourself that it is almost as true to say that one recovers from all
      things as that there is nothing which does not leave its scar. I had been
      the confidant of his serious passion, and I became the confidant of the
      various affairs that followed that first ineffaceable disappointment. He
      felt, he inspired, other loves. He tasted other joys. He endured other
      sorrows, and yet when we were alone and when we touched upon those
      confidences that come from the heart’s depths, the girl who was the
      ideal of his twentieth year reappeared in his words. How many times he has
      said to me, ‘In others I have always looked for her and as I have
      never found her, I have never truly loved any one but her.’”
    

      “And had she loved him?” I interrupted.
    

      “He did not think so,” replied Fauchery. “At least she
      had never told him so. Well, you must now imagine my friend at my age or
      almost there. You must picture him growing gray, tired of life and
      convinced that he had at last discovered the secret of peace. At this time
      he met, while visiting some relatives in a country house, a mere girl of
      twenty, who was the image, the haunting image of her whom he had hoped to
      marry thirty years before. It was one of those strange resemblances which
      extend from the color of the eyes to the ‘timbre’ of the
      voice, from the smile to the thought, from the gestures to the finest
      feelings of the heart. I could not, in a few disjointed phrases describe
      to you the strange emotions of my friend. It would take pages and pages to
      make you understand the tenderness, both present and at the same time
      retrospective, for the dead through the living; the hypnotic condition of
      the soul which does not know where dreams and memories end and present
      feeling begins; the daily commingling of the most unreal thing in the
      world, the phantom of a lost love, with the freshest, the most actual, the
      most irresistibly naÃ¯ve and spontaneous thing in it, a young girl. She
      comes, she goes, she laughs, she sings, you go about with her in the
      intimacy of country life, and at her side walks one long dead. After two
      weeks of almost careless abandon to the dangerous delights of this inward
      agitation imagine my friend entering by chance one morning one of the less
      frequented rooms of the house, a gallery, where, among other pictures,
      hung a portrait of himself, painted when he was twenty-five. He approaches
      the portrait abstractedly. There had been a fire in the room, so that a
      slight moisture dimmed the glass which protected the pastel, and on this
      glass, because of this moisture, he sees distinctly the trace of two lips
      which had been placed upon the eyes of the portrait, two small delicate
      lips, the sight of which makes his heart beat. He leaves the gallery,
      questions a servant, who tells him that no one but the young woman he has
      in mind has been in the room that morning.”
    

      “What then?” I asked, as he paused.
    

      “My friend returned to the gallery, looked once more at the adorable
      imprint of the most innocent, the most passionate of caresses. A mirror
      hung near by, where he could compare his present with his former face, the
      man he was with the man he had been. He never told me and I never asked
      what his feelings were at that moment. Did he feel that he was too
      culpable to have inspired a passion in a young girl whom he would have
      been a fool, almost a criminal, to marry? Did he comprehend that through
      his age which was so apparent, it was his youth which this child loved?
      Did he remember, with a keenness that was all too sad, that other, who had
      never given him a kiss like that at a time when he might have returned it?
      I only know that he left the same day, determined never again to see one
      whom he could no longer love as he had loved the other, with the hope, the
      purity, the soul of a man of twenty.”
    

      A few hours after this conversation, I found myself once more in the
      office of the Boulevard, seated in Pascal’s den, and he was saying,
      “Already? Have you accomplished your interview with Pierre Fauchery?”
    

      “He would not even receive me,” I replied, boldly.
    

      “What did I tell you?” he sneered, shrugging his big
      shoulders. “We’ll get even with him on his next volume. But
      you know, Labarthe, as long as you continue to have that innocent look
      about you, you can’t expect to succeed in newspaper work.”
    

      I bore with the ill-humor of my chief. What would he have said if he had
      known that I had in my pocket an interview and in my head an anecdote
      which were material for a most successful story? And he has never had
      either the interview or the story. Since then I have made my way in the
      line where he said I should fail. I have lost my innocent look and I earn
      my thirty thousand francs a year, and more. I have never had the same
      pleasure in the printing of the most profitable, the most brilliant
      article that I had in consigning to oblivion the sheets relating my visit
      to Nemours. I often think that I have not served the cause of letters as I
      wanted to, since, with all my laborious work I have never written a book.
      And yet when I recall the irresistible impulse of respect which prevented
      me from committing toward a dearly loved master a most profitable but
      infamous indiscretion, I say to myself, “If you have not served the
      cause of letters, you have not betrayed it.” And this is the reason,
      now that Fauchery is no longer of this world, that it seems to me that the
      time has come for me to relate my first interview. There is none of which
      I am more proud.
