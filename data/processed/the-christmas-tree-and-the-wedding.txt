THE CHRISTMAS TREE AND THE WEDDING


BY FIODOR M. DOSTOYEVSKY

The other day I saw a wedding... But no! I would rather tell you about a
Christmas tree. The wedding was superb. I liked it immensely. But the
other incident was still finer. I don’t know why it is that the
sight of the wedding reminded me of the Christmas tree. This is the way it
happened:


Exactly five years ago, on New Year’s Eve, I was invited to a
children’s ball by a man high up in the business world, who had his
connections, his circle of acquaintances, and his intrigues. So it seemed
as though the children’s ball was merely a pretext for the parents
to come together and discuss matters of interest to themselves, quite
innocently and casually.


I was an outsider, and, as I had no special matters to air, I was able to
spend the evening independently of the others. There was another gentleman
present who like myself had just stumbled upon this affair of domestic
bliss. He was the first to attract my attention. His appearance was not
that of a man of birth or high family. He was tall, rather thin, very
serious, and well dressed. Apparently he had no heart for the family
festivities. The instant he went off into a corner by himself the smile
disappeared from his face, and his thick dark brows knitted into a frown.
He knew no one except the host and showed every sign of being bored to
death, though bravely sustaining the role of thorough enjoyment to the
end. Later I learned that he was a provincial, had come to the capital on
some important, brain-racking business, had brought a letter of
recommendation to our host, and our host had taken him under his
protection, not at all con amore. It was merely out of politeness
that he had invited him to the children’s ball.


They did not play cards with him, they did not offer him cigars. No one
entered into conversation with him. Possibly they recognised the bird by
its feathers from a distance. Thus, my gentleman, not knowing what to do
with his hands, was compelled to spend the evening stroking his whiskers.
His whiskers were really fine, but he stroked them so assiduously that one
got the feeling that the whiskers had come into the world first and
afterwards the man in order to stroke them.


There was another guest who interested me. But he was of quite a different
order. He was a personage. They called him Julian Mastakovich. At first
glance one could tell he was an honoured guest and stood in the same
relation to the host as the host to the gentleman of the whiskers. The
host and hostess said no end of amiable things to him, were most
attentive, wining him, hovering over him, bringing guests up to be
introduced, but never leading him to any one else. I noticed tears glisten
in our host’s eyes when Julian Mastakovich remarked that he had
rarely spent such a pleasant evening. Somehow I began to feel
uncomfortable in this personage’s presence. So, after amusing myself
with the children, five of whom, remarkably well-fed young persons, were
our host’s, I went into a little sitting-room, entirely unoccupied,
and seated myself at the end that was a conservatory and took up almost
half the room.


The children were charming. They absolutely refused to resemble their
elders, notwithstanding the efforts of mothers and governesses. In a jiffy
they had denuded the Christmas tree down to the very last sweet and had
already succeeded in breaking half of their playthings before they even
found out which belonged to whom.


One of them was a particularly handsome little lad, dark-eyed,
curly-haired, who stubbornly persisted in aiming at me with his wooden
gun. But the child that attracted the greatest attention was his sister, a
girl of about eleven, lovely as a Cupid. She was quiet and thoughtful,
with large, full, dreamy eyes. The children had somehow offended her, and
she left them and walked into the same room that I had withdrawn into.
There she seated herself with her doll in a corner.


“Her father is an immensely wealthy business man,” the guests
informed each other in tones of awe. “Three hundred thousand rubles
set aside for her dowry already.”


As I turned to look at the group from which I heard this news item
issuing, my glance met Julian Mastakovich’s. He stood listening to
the insipid chatter in an attitude of concentrated attention, with his
hands behind his back and his head inclined to one side.


All the while I was quite lost in admiration of the shrewdness our host
displayed in the dispensing of the gifts. The little maid of the
many-rubied dowry received the handsomest doll, and the rest of the gifts
were graded in value according to the diminishing scale of the parents’
stations in life. The last child, a tiny chap of ten, thin, red-haired,
freckled, came into possession of a small book of nature stories without
illustrations or even head and tail pieces. He was the governess’s
child. She was a poor widow, and her little boy, clad in a sorry-looking
little nankeen jacket, looked thoroughly crushed and intimidated. He took
the book of nature stories and circled slowly about the children’s
toys. He would have given anything to play with them. But he did not dare
to. You could tell he already knew his place.


I like to observe children. It is fascinating to watch the individuality
in them struggling for self-assertion. I could see that the other children’s
things had tremendous charm for the red-haired boy, especially a toy
theatre, in which he was so anxious to take a part that he resolved to
fawn upon the other children. He smiled and began to play with them. His
one and only apple he handed over to a puffy urchin whose pockets were
already crammed with sweets, and he even carried another youngster
pickaback—all simply that he might be allowed to stay with the
theatre.


But in a few moments an impudent young person fell on him and gave him a
pummelling. He did not dare even to cry. The governess came and told him
to leave off interfering with the other children’s games, and he
crept away to the same room the little girl and I were in. She let him sit
down beside her, and the two set themselves busily dressing the expensive
doll.


Almost half an hour passed, and I was nearly dozing off, as I sat there in
the conservatory half listening to the chatter of the red-haired boy and
the dowered beauty, when Julian Mastakovich entered suddenly. He had
slipped out of the drawing-room under cover of a noisy scene among the
children. From my secluded corner it had not escaped my notice that a few
moments before he had been eagerly conversing with the rich girl’s
father, to whom he had only just been introduced.


He stood still for a while reflecting and mumbling to himself, as if
counting something on his fingers.


“Three hundred—three hundred—eleven—twelve—thirteen—sixteen—in
five years! Let’s say four per cent—five times twelve—sixty,
and on these sixty——. Let us assume that in five years it will
amount to—well, four hundred. Hm—hm! But the shrewd old fox
isn’t likely to be satisfied with four per cent. He gets eight or
even ten, perhaps. Let’s suppose five hundred, five hundred
thousand, at least, that’s sure. Anything above that for pocket
money—hm—”


He blew his nose and was about to leave the room when he spied the girl
and stood still. I, behind the plants, escaped his notice. He seemed to me
to be quivering with excitement. It must have been his calculations that
upset him so. He rubbed his hands and danced from place to place, and kept
getting more and more excited. Finally, however, he conquered his emotions
and came to a standstill. He cast a determined look at the future bride
and wanted to move toward her, but glanced about first. Then, as if with a
guilty conscience, he stepped over to the child on tip-toe, smiling, and
bent down and kissed her head.


His coming was so unexpected that she uttered a shriek of alarm.


“What are you doing here, dear child?” he whispered, looking
around and pinching her cheek.


“We’re playing.”


“What, with him?” said Julian Mastakovich with a look askance
at the governess’s child. “You should go into the
drawing-room, my lad,” he said to him.


The boy remained silent and looked up at the man with wide-open eyes.
Julian Mastakovich glanced round again cautiously and bent down over the
girl.


“What have you got, a doll, my dear?”


“Yes, sir.” The child quailed a little, and her brow wrinkled.


“A doll? And do you know, my dear, what dolls are made of?”


“No, sir,” she said weakly, and lowered her head.


“Out of rags, my dear. You, boy, you go back to the drawing-room, to
the children,” said Julian Mastakovich looking at the boy sternly.


The two children frowned. They caught hold of each other and would not
part.


“And do you know why they gave you the doll?” asked Julian
Mastakovich, dropping his voice lower and lower.


“No.”


“Because you were a good, very good little girl the whole week.”


Saying which, Julian Mastakovich was seized with a paroxysm of agitation.
He looked round and said in a tone faint, almost inaudible with excitement
and impatience:


“If I come to visit your parents will you love me, my dear?”


He tried to kiss the sweet little creature, but the red-haired boy saw
that she was on the verge of tears, and he caught her hand and sobbed out
loud in sympathy. That enraged the man.


“Go away! Go away! Go back to the other room, to your playmates.”


“I don’t want him to. I don’t want him to! You go away!”
cried the girl. “Let him alone! Let him alone!” She was almost
weeping.


There was a sound of footsteps in the doorway. Julian Mastakovich started
and straightened up his respectable body. The red-haired boy was even more
alarmed. He let go the girl’s hand, sidled along the wall, and
escaped through the drawing-room into the dining-room.


Not to attract attention, Julian Mastakovich also made for the
dining-room. He was red as a lobster. The sight of himself in a mirror
seemed to embarrass him. Presumably he was annoyed at his own ardour and
impatience. Without due respect to his importance and dignity, his
calculations had lured and pricked him to the greedy eagerness of a boy,
who makes straight for his object—though this was not as yet an
object; it only would be so in five years’ time. I followed the
worthy man into the dining-room, where I witnessed a remarkable play.


Julian Mastakovich, all flushed with vexation, venom in his look, began to
threaten the red-haired boy. The red-haired boy retreated farther and
farther until there was no place left for him to retreat to, and he did
not know where to turn in his fright.


“Get out of here! What are you doing here? Get out, I say, you
good-for-nothing! Stealing fruit, are you? Oh, so, stealing fruit! Get
out, you freckle face, go to your likes!”


The frightened child, as a last desperate resort, crawled quickly under
the table. His persecutor, completely infuriated, pulled out his large
linen handkerchief and used it as a lash to drive the boy out of his
position.


Here I must remark that Julian Mastakovich was a somewhat corpulent man,
heavy, well-fed, puffy-cheeked, with a paunch and ankles as round as nuts.
He perspired and puffed and panted. So strong was his dislike (or was it
jealousy?) of the child that he actually began to carry on like a madman.


I laughed heartily. Julian Mastakovich turned. He was utterly confused and
for a moment, apparently, quite oblivious of his immense importance. At
that moment our host appeared in the doorway opposite. The boy crawled out
from under the table and wiped his knees and elbows. Julian Mastakovich
hastened to carry his handkerchief, which he had been dangling by the
corner, to his nose. Our host looked at the three of us rather
suspiciously. But, like a man who knows the world and can readily adjust
himself, he seized upon the opportunity to lay hold of his very valuable
guest and get what he wanted out of him.


“Here’s the boy I was talking to you about,” he said,
indicating the red-haired child. “I took the liberty of presuming on
your goodness in his behalf.”


“Oh,” replied Julian Mastakovich, still not quite master of
himself.


“He’s my governess’s son,” our host continued in a
beseeching tone. “She’s a poor creature, the widow of an
honest official. That’s why, if it were possible for you—”


“Impossible, impossible!” Julian Mastakovich cried hastily.
“You must excuse me, Philip Alexeyevich, I really cannot. I’ve
made inquiries. There are no vacancies, and there is a waiting list of ten
who have a greater right—I’m sorry.”


“Too bad,” said our host. “He’s a quiet,
unobtrusive child.”


“A very naughty little rascal, I should say,” said Julian
Mastakovich, wryly. “Go away, boy. Why are you here still? Be off
with you to the other children.”


Unable to control himself, he gave me a sidelong glance. Nor could I
control myself. I laughed straight in his face. He turned away and asked
our host, in tones quite audible to me, who that odd young fellow was.
They whispered to each other and left the room, disregarding me.


I shook with laughter. Then I, too, went to the drawing-room. There the
great man, already surrounded by the fathers and mothers and the host and
the hostess, had begun to talk eagerly with a lady to whom he had just
been introduced. The lady held the rich little girl’s hand. Julian
Mastakovich went into fulsome praise of her. He waxed ecstatic over the
dear child’s beauty, her talents, her grace, her excellent breeding,
plainly laying himself out to flatter the mother, who listened scarcely
able to restrain tears of joy, while the father showed his delight by a
gratified smile.


The joy was contagious. Everybody shared in it. Even the children were
obliged to stop playing so as not to disturb the conversation. The
atmosphere was surcharged with awe. I heard the mother of the important
little girl, touched to her profoundest depths, ask Julian Mastakovich in
the choicest language of courtesy, whether he would honour them by coming
to see them. I heard Julian Mastakovich accept the invitation with
unfeigned enthusiasm. Then the guests scattered decorously to different
parts of the room, and I heard them, with veneration in their tones, extol
the business man, the business man’s wife, the business man’s
daughter, and, especially, Julian Mastakovich.


“Is he married?” I asked out loud of an acquaintance of mine
standing beside Julian Mastakovich.


Julian Mastakovich gave me a venomous look.


“No,” answered my acquaintance, profoundly shocked by my—intentional—indiscretion.









Not long ago I passed the Church of——. I was struck by the
concourse of people gathered there to witness a wedding. It was a dreary
day. A drizzling rain was beginning to come down. I made my way through
the throng into the church. The bridegroom was a round, well-fed,
pot-bellied little man, very much dressed up. He ran and fussed about and
gave orders and arranged things. Finally word was passed that the bride
was coming. I pushed through the crowd, and I beheld a marvellous beauty
whose first spring was scarcely commencing. But the beauty was pale and
sad. She looked distracted. It seemed to me even that her eyes were red
from recent weeping. The classic severity of every line of her face
imparted a peculiar significance and solemnity to her beauty. But through
that severity and solemnity, through the sadness, shone the innocence of a
child. There was something inexpressibly naÃ¯ve, unsettled and young in her
features, which, without words, seemed to plead for mercy.


They said she was just sixteen years old. I looked at the bridegroom
carefully. Suddenly I recognised Julian Mastakovich, whom I had not seen
again in all those five years. Then I looked at the bride again.—Good
God! I made my way, as quickly as I could, out of the church. I heard
gossiping in the crowd about the bride’s wealth—about her
dowry of five hundred thousand rubles—so and so much for pocket
money.


“Then his calculations were correct,” I thought, as I pressed
out into the street.
