MEDITATIONS OF A MARINER
BY WALLACE IRWIN

A-watchin' how the sea behaves
For hours and hours I sit;
And I know the sea is full o' wavesâ€”
I've often noticed it.

For on the deck each starry night
The wild waves and the tame
I counts and knows 'em all by sight
And some of 'em by name.

And then I thinks a cove like me
Ain't got no right to roam;
For I'm homesick when I puts to sea
And seasick when I'm home.
