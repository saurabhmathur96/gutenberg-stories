PONCHUS PILUT
BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY

Ponchus Pilut used to be
1st a Slave, an' now he's free.
Slaves wuz on'y ist before
The War wuz—an' ain't no more.

He works on our place fer us,—
An' comes here—sometimes he does.
He shocks corn an' shucks it.—An'
He makes hominy "by han'!"—

Wunst he bringed us some, one trip,
Tied up in a piller-slip:
Pa says, when Ma cooked it, "MY!
This-here's gooder'n you buy!"

Ponchus pats fer me an' sings;
An' he says most funny things!
Ponchus calls a dish a "deesh"—
Yes, an' he calls fishes "feesh"!

When Ma want him eat wiv us
He says, "'Skuse me—'deed you mus'!—
Ponchus know good manners, Miss.—
He aint eat wher' White-folks is!"

'Lindy takes his dinner out
Wher' he's workin'—roun' about.—
Wunst he et his dinner, spread
In our ole wheel-borry-bed.

Ponchus Pilut says "'at's not
His right name,—an' done fergot
What his sho'-nuff name is now—
An' don' matter none nohow!"

Yes, an' Ponchus he'ps Pa, too,
When our butcherin's to do,
An' scalds hogs—an' says "Take care
'Bout it, er you'll set the hair!"

Yes, an' out in our back-yard
He he'ps 'Lindy rendur lard;
An', wite in the fire there, he
Roast' a pig-tail wunst fer me.—

An' ist nen th'ole tavurn-bell
Rung, down town, an' he says "Well!—
Hear dat! Lan' o' Canaan, Son,
Aint dat bell say 'Pig-tail done!'

—'Pig-tail done!
Go call Son!—
Tell dat
Chile dat
Pig-tail done!'"
