experiences well authenticated, merely illustrate what sleight-of-

"mind readers," and the like, can be proven to be frauds.  Their
dupes are puzzled, and sometimes won over, in the name of
Spiritualism, either by the tricks familiar to all "conjurers," or
else by the psychology of deception (see page 280).  Some of the
cleverness displayed is marvelous, as the following pages show.
