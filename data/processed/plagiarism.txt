With that bang! he lifted himself bodily into the a'r, and he come down
with his knees, his ten fingers, his ten toes, his elbows, and his nose,
striking every single solitary key on the pianner at the same time. The
thing busted and went off into seventeen hundred and fifty-seven
thousand five hundred and forty-two hemi-demi-semi-quivers, and I know'd
no mo'.
When I come to, I were under ground about twenty foot, in a place they
call Oyster Bay, treatin' a Yankee that I never laid eyes on before and
never expect to ag'in. Day was breakin' by the time I got to the St.
Nicholas Hotel, and I pledge you my word I did not know my name. The man
asked me the number of my room, and I told him, "Hot music on the
half-shell for two!"

PLAGIARISM
BY JOHN B. TABB

If Poe from Pike The Raven stole,
As his accusers say,
Then to embody Adam's soul,
God plagiarised the clay.
